APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-146/2019-20/789         dated   02.11.2023\n       whereby the respondent no. 5 was requested to keep the three Bank Guarantees\n       [IBG113029 dated 25.01.2021, IBG113031 dated 25.01.2021 and IBG113102\n       dated 27.01.2021] on hold, had informed the respondent no. 5 that his said Letter\n       bearing     Reference    no.

Assailing mainly the action on the part of the respondent APDCL authorities to\n     encash     the    afore-mentioned    three   Bank   Guarantees   [IBG113029      dated\n     25.01.2021, IBG113031 dated 25.01.2021 and IBG113102 dated 27.01.2021], the\n     petitioner has instituted the present writ petition by seeking to invoke the extra-\n     ordinary, discretionary and equitable jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the\n     Constitution of India of this Court for the reliefs/directions, mentioned above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">8.   I have heard Mr. K.N. Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Mr. J.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">     Patowary, learned counsel for the petitioner; Mr. I. Chowdhury, learned Senior\n     Counsel assisted by MR. K.P. Pathak, learned Standing Counsel, APDCL for the\n     respondent nos. 1 - 4; and Mr. M. Sharma, learned counsel for the respondent\n     no. 5 Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">9.   Mr. K.N. Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner has\n     submitted that despite the petitioner&#x27;s earnest endeavour to find around 500\n     Bighas of land for the Region-2 Project, the same could not be arranged in due\n     time because of the restrictions in holding such large chunks of land by any\n     individual/entity under the extant land laws. He has alleged arbitrariness on the\n     part of the respondent APDCL authorities in seeking to invoke and encash the\n     Bank Guarantees despite earlier agreeing to provide 1 [one] month time on\n     02.11.2023 in terms of the petitioner&#x27;s request made on 02.11.2023. It is his\n     submission that Clause 5.7.1 of the Power Purchase Agreement [PPA] has\n     provided for extension of time on certain grounds in the event the Solar Power\n     Developer is prevented from achieving the progress within the stipulated time\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                           Page No. 11/52</span>\n\n      period. In the case in hand, the petitioner is affected by force majeure and as\n      such, the agencies of the State ought to have come in aid of the petitioner in\n      arrangement of required areas of land for the Project. He has, thus, contended\n      that in such backdrop, the decision on the part of the respondent APDCL\n      authorities to invoke and encash the Bank Guarantees by the impugned Letters -\n      dated 01.11.2023 &amp; dated 06.11.2023 - is clearly arbitrary and unjust. If in that\n      manner the Bank Guarantees are invoked and encashed, the petitioner will suffer\n      severe loss and the same would cause immense prejudice to the business of the\n      petitioner. It has further been contended that in a Bank Guarantee, the validity\n      period and the claim period have to be one and the same ordinarily, unless any\n      agreement to the contrary. But in the three Bank Guarantees under reference, the\n      respondent no. 5 Bank had unilaterally incorporated a condition therein, thereby,\n      extending the claim period by 1 [one] year, beyond the validity period of the Bank\n      Guarantees. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_10\">The Bank Guarantees, as per Clause 4.4 of the Power Purchase\n      Agreement [PPA], were required to be in the format provided in Schedule 3. As\n      the incorporation of a claim period beyond the validity period in the Bank\n      Guarantees was at the behest of the respondent no. 5 Bank, behind the back of\n      the petitioner and without insistence from the respondent APDCL, the respondent\n      APDCL cannot be permitted to take advantage from such extended claim period.\n      In addition, a reference has been made to the provisions of Section 28 r/w\n      Exception 3 thereof of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_3\">Indian Contract Act, 1872</a> [&#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_4\">Contract Act</a>&#x27;, for short]\n      to contend and to raise an issue of impermissibility regarding incorporation of\n      such clause in the Bank Guarantees. As regards the law laid down in respect of\n      Bank Guarantees, reference has been made to a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n      Court of <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_5\">India, U.P. State Sugar Corporation vs. Sumac International Limited</a>,\n      reported in [1997] 1 SCC 568.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">10.   Au contraire, Mr. I. Chowdhury, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n      respondent APDCL authorities has submitted that from the Bank Guarantees, it is\n      evidently clear that the Bank Guarantees are irrevocable and unconditional ones.\n      In view of Bank Guarantees of such nature, the ground taken by the petitioner as\n      regards non-availability of required areas of land to establish the Project in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                           Page No. 12/52</span>\n\n      Region-2 is immaterial. He has contended that since a Bank Guarantee is an\n      independent contract between the Guarantor Bank and the Beneficiary, that is,\n      the respondent no. 5 Bank and the APDCL respectively in the case in hand, any\n      such dispute, even if raised, by the petitioner at whose instance the respondent\n      no. 5 Bank has provided the Bank Guarantees is of no consequence. It is not the\n      case of the petitioner that there is either any fraud of an egregious nature or any\n      irretrievable injustice would occur. In the absence of any such pleas, a writ\n      petition to restrain invocation and encashment of such Bank Guarantees is not to\n      be entertained. He has further contended that the Bank Guarantees have\n      provided for a claim period different from the validity period. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"854142\" id=\"span_13\">It is his submission\n      that on a reading of the clause which incorporated an extended claim period in\n      the Bank Guarantees, it is discernible that the same cannot be, by any stretch,\n      relatable to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 28</a> and Exception 3 thereof of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_7\">Contract\n      Act</a>. It is his further contention that Exception 3 of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 28</a> is in connection\n      with legal proceedings and not with regard to any claim period. It has been\n      submitted that it has been a consistent practice of the Banks to incorporate a\n      claim period in a Bank Guarantee, beyond the validity period of the Bank\n      Guarantee and there being no illegality, the petitioner who himself had submitted\n      those Bank Guarantees to the APDCL authorities on 29.01.2021, is precluded from\n      raising any issue with regard to such Clause regarding extended claim period, that\n      too, belatedly by feigning ignorance. Mr. Pathak, learned Standing Counsel,\n      APDCL has placed two decisions - <a href=\"/doc/854142/\" id=\"a_9\">Himadri Chemicals Industries Limited vs. Coal Tar\n      Refining Company</a>, reported in [2007] 8 <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_10\">SCC 110 and Vinitec Electronics Private\n      Limited vs. HCL Infosystems Limited</a>, reported in [2008] 1 SCC 544, to buttress the\n      submissions.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"18334360\" id=\"span_14\">11.   Mr. Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the respondent no. 5 Bank has\n      submitted that there is no legal bar to have one validity period and a different\n      claim period beyond such validity period, in a Bank Guarantee. He has submitted\n      that in a Bank Guarantee, it is necessary to provide a claim period, slightly longer\n      than the validity period of the guarantee. A longer claim period is necessitated for\n      the reason that if the Principal Debtor commits a default on the last day of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                           Page No. 13/52</span>\n\n      validity period, then the beneficiary can at the earliest invoke the same only on\n      the next day. Referring to a circular being Circular no. 10349/CRD/IRMDC34/20-\n      21 dated 17.06.2020, issued by the Credit Risk Division of the Federal Bank, he\n      has submitted that thereby, a policy decision has been taken by the respondent\n      no. 5 Bank to include one year claim period in all guarantees issued by the Bank.\n      He has submitted that such extended claim period has consistently been\n      incorporated in Bank Guarantees in view of circulars issued by Indian Banks\n      Association [IBA]. As per practice prevalent in the banking sector, the claim\n      period in a Bank Guarantee is a grace period awarded beyond the validity period\n      of the Bank Guarantee to make a demand on the Guarantor Bank for a default,\n      which occurred during the validity period of the Bank Guarantee. He has\n      submitted that though it has been contended that the direction contained in the\n      circulars issued by the IBA to have a claim period in the Bank Guarantee beyond\n      the validity period is relatable to Exception 3 of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act but\n      in the case in hand, it is the clause in issue in the three Bank Guarantees over\n      which the parties have crossed swords, is to be read for the purpose of deciding\n      the issue. He has referred to a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court rendered,\n      on 28.07.2021, in a writ petition, Writ Petition no. 7677/2019 [<a href=\"/doc/18334360/\" id=\"a_12\">Larsen and Toubro\n      Limited vs. Punjab National Bank and another</a>], wherein the Exception 3 to\n      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act came up for consideration.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185400685\" id=\"span_16\">He has also referred to\n      a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/185400685/\" id=\"a_14\">Union of India and another vs.\n      Indusind Bank Limited and another</a>, reported in [2016] 9 SCC 720.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">12.   Mr. Choudhury, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in his reply\n      submissions, has submitted that there was no instructions from the petitioner&#x27;s\n      side to incorporate any clause of non-obstante nature for any claim period other\n      than the agreed validity period, in the Bank Guarantees, which is beyond the\n      validity period of the Bank Guarantees. He has also contended that the petitioner\n      was neither a party to the Bank Guarantees nor privy to the said clause at the\n      time of issuance of the same. It has, thus, been sought to articulate that insertion\n      of such clause amounts to committing fraud upon the petitioner and the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                               Page No. 14/52</span>\n\n      would cause irretrievable loss and injury to the petitioner not only to the extent of\n      the amount involved in the Bank Guarantees but much beyond.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">13.

The petitioner has stated that the petitioner made a request to the Assam\n      Industrial Development Corporation [AIDC] Limited to allot 500 Bighas of land to\n      him for the Project. But the AIDC Limited vide its Letter dated 02.11.2021\n      informed the petitioner to the effect that it did not have any such land for\n      allotment in the districts of Goalpara, Bongaigaon, Barpeta, Nalbari, Kamrup -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">      Metro and Kamrup - Rural. The petitioner was also informed by the AIDC Limited\n      that the petitioner could apply for allotment of land at other locations of the AIDC\n      Limited in Assam. The petitioner has further stated that vide his Letter dated\n      03.11.2021, the petitioner had informed the respondent no. 4 to the effect that\n      though he had identified private patta lands but the land owners refused to sell\n      those lands. By informing about the inability of the AIDC Limited to allot required\n      areas of land for the Region-2 Project in the districts mentioned above, the\n      petitioner through his Letter dated 03.11.2021 requested the respondent APDCL\n      authorities either to arrange for the areas of land required for the Region-2\n      Project or to change the Region of the petitioner, that is, Region-2 so as to enable\n      him to search for land for the Project at other locations. The petitioner has further\n      averred that despite his sincere endeavour to find 500 Bighas of land for\n      establishing the Project in Region-2, no positive result yielded. When the\n      petitioner was served with the Show Cause Notice dated 28.12.2022, the\n      petitioner once again brought the matter of non-availability of land in Region-2 in\n      his Reply dated 05.01.2023.

The petitioner has challenged the decision taken by the respondent\n      APDCL authorities to invoke the three Bank Guarantees in such manner as\n      arbitrary and unjust.

From Clause 1.5 of the RFS Document, it is clear that\n      the responsibility to arrange for the areas of land required to construct and\n      commission the Region-2 Project, that is, 25 MW AC Grid Connected Solar\n      Photovoltaic Project on &#x27;Build-Own-Operate&#x27; basis was entirely of the Successful\n      Bidder/Solar Power Developer.

As per Clause 1.3.4 : &#x27;Delay in\n      Commissioning&#x27;, failure to achieve the Project COD on or before the scheduled\n      COD by the bidder shall attract encashment and invocation of Performance\n      Security followed by imposition of Delay Liquidated Damages. It was stipulated in\n      Clause 7.1.4. of the RFP Document to the effect that if a bidder was declared as\n      the Successful Bidder, then the Bid Security of such Successful Bidder was to be\n      returned upon signing the Power Purchase Agreement [PPA] with the APDCL and\n      submission of the Performance Security or Performance Guarantee or equivalent\n      in the form of Bank Guarantees, in accordance with the timelines and provisions\n      mentioned in the Project Power Purchase Agreement [PPA].\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">17.

The petitioner was\n      informed that such situation had given rise a situation for the APDCL to take\n      necessary action against the petitioner by way of termination of the contract by\n      declaring him as a non-performer and also by invoking the Bank Guarantees\n      amounting to Rs. 4,20,00,000/- furnished towards Performance Security. The\n      petitioner was thereby, asked to show cause by 31.12.2022 as to [i] why the\n      contract shall not be terminated; [ii] why the petitioner should not be declared as\n      non-performer; [iii] why the petitioner should not be debarred for 3 [three] years\n      from participating in any future bid of the APDCL; and [iv] why Security Deposit\n      submitted against the Region-2 Project should not be encashed/invoked.

The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by now well settled.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      When in the course of commercial dealings an unconditional bank guarantee\n      is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank\n      guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank\n      giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of\n      any dispute raised by its customer. The very purpose of giving such a bank\n      guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The courts should, therefore, be slow\n      in granting an injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee.\n      The courts have carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in connection with\n      such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank\n      guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to\n      take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. The second exception\n      relates to cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional bank\n      guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties\n      concerned. Since in most cases payment of money under such a bank\n      guarantee would adversely affect the bank and its customer at whose\n      instance the guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated under\n      this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would\n      override the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an\n      injunction on commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds are not\n      necessarily connected, though both may co-exist in some cases. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_29\">In the case of\n      <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_17\">U.P.

The law relating to grant or refusal to grant injunction in the matter of\n      invocation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is now well settled by a\n      plethora of decisions not only of this Court but also of the different High\n      Courts in India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_22\">U.P. State Sugar Corporation vs. Sumac International\n      Ltd.</a>, [1997] 1 SCC 568, this court considered its various earlier decisions. In\n      this decision, the principle that has been laid down clearly on the\n      enforcement of a Bank guarantee or a letter of credit is that in respect of a\n      bank guarantee or a letter of credit which is sought to be encashed by a\n      beneficiary, the bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its\n      terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. Accordingly this\n      Court held that the courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction\n      to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee. It has also been held by\n      this Court in that decision that the existence of any dispute between the\n      parties to the contract is not a ground to restrain the enforcement of bank\n      guarantees or letters of credit. However this Court made two exceptions for\n      grant of an order of injunction to restrain the enforcement of a bank\n      guarantee or a letter of credit : [i] Fraud committed in the notice of the bank\n      which would vitiate the very foundation of guarantee; and [ii] injustice of the\n      kind which would make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">11.   Except under these circumstances, the courts should not readily issue\n      injunction to restrain the realization of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_35\">So far as the first exception is concerned, i.e. of fraud, one has to satisfy the\n      court that the fraud in connection with the bank guarantee or letter of credit\n      would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit.\n      So far as the second exception is concerned, this court has held in that\n      decision that it relates to cases where allowing encashment of an\n      unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice\n      to one of the parties concerned.

There are, however, two exceptions to this Rule. The first is when there is a\n           clear fraud of which the Bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary\n           from which it seeks to benefit. The fraud must be of an egregious nature as\n           to vitiate the entire underlying transaction. The second exception to the\n           general rule of non-intervention is when there are special equities in\n           favour of injunction, such as when irretrievable injury or irretrievable\n           injustice would occur if such an injunction were not granted. The general\n           rule and its exceptions has been reiterated in so many judgments of this\n           court, that in U.P.

Such a course is\n           impermissible.

At this stage, it is apposite to find out about the nature of the three Bank\n      Guarantees submitted by the petitioner. Each of the Bank Guarantees mention\n      that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1627496/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 4.4</a> of the Agreement [that is, the Power Purchase\n      Agreement (PPA)], the Solar Power Developer is required to furnish to the APDCL,\n      an unconditional and irrevocable Bank Guarantees for a definite amount as\n      security for due and punctual performance/discharge of its obligations under the\n      Agreement. The Bank Guarantees also mention that the respondent Bank has\n      agreed to provide the Bank Guarantees at the request of the Solar Power\n      Developer, that is, the petitioner. Thus, the respondent Bank has irrevocably\n      guaranteed due and punctual performance by the petitioner of all its obligations\n      relating to the Project under the Agreement. The respondent Bank as the primary\n      obligator has stated that it shall, without demur, pay to the APDCL the amounts\n      not exceeding in aggregate mentioned in each of the three Bank Guarantees,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                                    Page No. 37/52</span>\n\nwithin one working day of receipt of a written demand thereof from the APDCL\nstating that the Solar Power Developer, that is, the petitioner has failed to meet\nits performance obligations under the Agreement. The Bank Guarantees further\nmention that the respondent Bank as the Guarantor shall not go into the veracity\nof any breach or failure on the part of the Solar Power Developer, that is, the\npetitioner or validity of demand so made by the APDCL and shall pay the amount\nspecified in the demand, notwithstanding any direction to the contrary given or\nany dispute whatsoever raised by the Solar Power Developer, that is, the\npetitioner or any other person. The Bank Guarantees also mention that the Bank&#x27;s\nobligations as Guarantor under the Bank Guarantees shall subsist until all such\ndemands are duly made and discharged in accordance with the provisions of the\nBank Guarantees and in order to give effect to the Bank Guarantees, the APDCL\nshall be entitled to treat the Guarantor Bank as the Principal Debtor. The Bank\nGuarantees stipulate that they shall remain in full force and effect for the period\nof 22 [twenty-two] months from the date of signing of the Power Purchase\nAgreement [PPA]. The Bank Guarantees though mention about Clause 4.4 of the\nPower Purchase Agreement [PPA] the same does not go to change the nature of\nthe Bank Guarantees from unconditional and irrevocable Bank Guarantees to\nconditional ones as mere mention of Clause 4.4 of the Power Purchase Agreement\n[PPA] in the Preamble of the Bank Guarantees does not control the operative\nparts of the Bank Guarantees. It is clear from the Bank Guarantees that the\nAPDCL is the best judge to decide as to whether the Solar Power Developer, that\nis, the petitioner has failed to meet its performance obligations or not. In the\nevent of receipt of a written demand from the APDCL mentioning that the APDCL\nwants to invoke and encash the Bank Guarantees due to failure on the part of the\nSolar Power Developer, that is, the petitioner to meet its performance obligations,\nthe Guarantor Bank is not required to go into the veracity of such demand made\nby the APDCL. Meaning thereby, it is not open for the Guarantor Bank to enquire\nas to whether there is due performance of or there is failure to perform the\nobligations under the Principal Agreement, that is, the Power Purchase Agreement\n[PPA] on the part of the petitioner. As per the Bank Guarantees, the Guarantor\nBank on receipt of a written demand for encashment of the Bank Guarantees from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                                         Page No. 38/52</span>\n\n      the APDCL, shall have to pay the amounts specified in the demand without any\n      demur. It has been clearly stipulated in the Bank Guarantees that any dispute\n      between the APDCL and the Solar Power Developer, that is, the petitioner at\n      whose instance the Guarantor Bank has given the Bank Guarantees, is immaterial\n      and is of no consequence. Having gone through the terms and conditions of the\n      three Bank Guarantees, by keeping the principles enunciated in the decisions cited\n      above, this Court is of the unhesitant view that the three Bank Guarantees are\n      unconditional and irrevocable in nature. The petitioner has stated that the\n      petitioner had signed the Power Purchase Agreement [PPA] on 15.02.2021.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">24.   On perusal of the three Bank Guarantees, all similarly worded and one of which\n      has been extracted hereinabove, it is also noticed that the Bank Guarantees have\n      two different time-periods/dates. One is the validity period [Expiry Date]\n      indicating the date till which the particular Bank Guarantee would remain valid\n      and the other is the claim period which indicates a period beyond the validity\n      period of the Bank Guarantee to make a written claim or demand to the Bank\n      against a default. For example, the Bank Guarantee bearing no. IBG113029 dated\n      25.01.2021 for a guarantee amount of Rs. 84,00,000/- has mentioned that the\n      Bank Guarantee shall be valid upto 24.01.2023 and the Bank shall be liable to pay\n      the guarantee amount only and only if the Bank receives from the beneficiary [the\n      APDCL], a written claim or demand no later than 1 [one] year from the expiry\n      date, meaning thereby, the claim period would be upto 24.01.2024. If such\n      validity period of the Bank Guarantee upto 24.01.2023 and the claim period upto\n      24.01.2024 are found to be sustainable then the claim or demand made by the\n      APDCL to the respondent no. 5 Bank on 01.11.2023 by the impugned Letter\n      bearing no. APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-146/2019-20/787 dated 01.11.2023 and/or\n      on 06.11.2023 by the impugned Letter bearing no. APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-\n      146/2019-20/790 dated 06.11.2023 would, in turn, have to be regarded as a\n      written claim or demand made within time.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18334360\" id=\"span_53\">25.   The learned counsel for all the parties are in general agreement that a Standard\n      Bank Guarantee would usually contain the three terms :- [a] Expiry Period/Validity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                                           Page No. 39/52</span>\n\n      Period; [b] Claim Period; and [c] Enforcement Period. They are also in consensus\n      ad item to the expositions provided to the said three terms in <a href=\"/doc/18334360/\" id=\"a_36\">Larsen and Toubro\n      Limited</a> [supra] in the following manner :-</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      [a] Expiry Period/Validity Period : A bank guarantee would prescribe a specific\n          date by which a bank guarantee would expire. This is a time determined by\n          the Principal Debtor and the Creditor. The right to invoke the bank guarantee\n          is only for a default of the Principal Debtor which occurs during the validity\n          period of the bank guarantee.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      [b] Claim Period : This is a time period contractually agreed between the Creditor\n          and the Principal Debtor which provides a grace period beyond the validity\n          period to make a demand on the bank for a default which has occurred\n          during the validity period. A claim period may or may not exist in the bank\n          guarantee. The guarantor again has no role to play.\n      [c] Enforcement Period : The enforcement period is a time period within which\n          the Creditor can enforce his accrued rights pursuant to a demand made by\n          him within the validity period or the claim period before a competent court of\n          law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">26.   <a href=\"/doc/53550/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 126</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 has provided for the definitions of\n      &#x27;Contract of Guarantee&#x27;, &#x27;Surety&#x27;, &#x27;Principal Debtor&#x27; and &#x27;Creditor&#x27;. As per <a href=\"/doc/53550/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n      126</a>, a &#x27;Contract of Guarantee&#x27; is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge\n      the liability, of a third person in case of his default.

The Law Commission of India has recommended in its 97 th Report that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_45\">Section\n           28</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 may be amended so that the anomalous\n           situation created by the existing section may be rectified. It has been held by the\n           courts that the said <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 28</a> shall invalidate only a clause in any agreement\n           which restricts any party thereto from enforcing his rights absolutely or which\n           limits the time within which he may enforce his rights absolutely or which limits\n           the time within which he may enforce his rights. The courts have, however, held\n           that this section shall not come into operation when the contractual term spells\n           out an extinction of the right of a party to sue or spells out the discharge of a\n           party from all liability in respect of the claim. What is thus hit by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 28</a> is an\n           agreement relinquishing the remedy only i.e. where the time-limit specified in\n           the agreement is assumed to exist between remedy and right and this distinction\n           is the basis of the present position under which a clause barring a remedy is void,\n           but a clause extinguishing the rights is valid. This approach may be sound in\n           theory but, in practice, it causes serious hardship and might even be abused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">      2.

Stating that it was one of the largest construction companies in\n      India, the writ petition was instituted arraigning the Guarantor Bank, Punjab\n      National Bank as party-respondent no. 1, M/s Indian Banks Association as party-\n      respondent no. 2 and the Reserve Bank of India [RBI] as party-respondent no. 3.\n      It was contended that the petitioner had a number of contracts with Government\n      bodies and Public Sector Undertakings and to participate in the bidding processes/\n      to execute contract-works awarded to it, it required to submit bid securities/\n      performance securities in the form of Bank Guarantees. On the basis of circulars\n      issued by the respondent no. 2 which is an association of banks, the respondent\n      no. 1 Bank by its communications, impugned therein, insisted that the Bank\n      Guarantees should have a claim period of twelve months and any claim period\n      lesser than twelve months, would effectively increase the claim period in respect\n      of the Bank Guarantees to three years under the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_56\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>. The\n      respondent no. 3, the RBI in its counter affidavit filed therein had taken a stand\n      that Bank Guarantees were structured according to the terms of the agreements\n      and the terms were decided mutually between the parties, that is, the Surety, the\n      Principal Debtor and the Creditor. It was further clarified that the RBI had not\n      prescribed any terms to be incorporated in the Bank Guarantees and the terms of\n      the Bank Guarantees to be issued by the Guarantor Banks were decided in terms\n      of the respective policy of the concerned banks and on the basis of the\n      contractual arrangements between the parties. In so far as the advises contained\n      in the circulars of the party-respondent no. 2 therein, that is, the Indian Banks\n      Association [IBA] were concerned, it was found out that the IBA had advised that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                                           Page No. 44/52</span>\n\n      if the banks would issue Bank Guarantees with a claim period of less than one\n      year then such Bank Guarantees would not have the benefit of Exception 3 to\n      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 28</a> and would stand exposed to the period of limitation under the\n      <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_58\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>. The IBA had, thus, advised the banks to issue every Bank\n      Guarantee with a minimum claim period of one year beyond the validity period of\n      the Bank Guarantee. It is pertinent to mention that the limitation period\n      prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_59\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> is thirty years where the claimant is the\n      Government and the period is three years in respect of others.

It has been\n      held that the respondent Bank and the IBA erred in interpreting the scope of\n      Exception 3 to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 28</a>. It has been further held that there is no mandatory\n      requirement that the claim period for a Bank Guarantee has to be for minimum\n      twelve months.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185400685\" id=\"span_61\">31.   The issues involved in <a href=\"/doc/185400685/\" id=\"a_63\">Indusind Bank Limited</a> [supra], were with regard to Bank\n      Guarantees which were required to be kept valid upto six months with a provision\n      for claims for an additional three months. The Bank Guarantees involved therein\n      had clauses as follows :- [i] &#x27;... Unless a demand or claim under this guarantee is\n      made against us within three months from the above date [i.e. on or before\n      30.04.1997], all your rights under the said guarantee will be forfeited and we shall\n      be relieved and discharged from all liabilities hereunder&#x27;; and [ii] &#x27;...

It has\n      been observed that none of the aforesaid clauses purports to curtail the period of\n      limitation within which a suit can be brought to enforce the Bank Guarantees.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                          Page No. 45/52</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">32.   Assertion of right under a contract in the form of a claim or demand is different\n      from enforcing it in a Court of law by way of any legal proceedings. On a plain\n      reading of the recitals in the three Bank Guarantees involved herein, as extracted\n      in bold letters in paragraph 22 above, as regards the validity period/expiry date\n      and the claim period, it does not go to indicate that it has dealt with any matter\n      relating to enforcement of right to claim by way of Legal proceedings in a court of\n      law. It has only dealt with assertion of claim of the guaranteed amount within a\n      year beyond the validity period of the Bank Guarantees. To be more precise, it\n      emerges, on a plain reading, that though Bank Guarantees bearing no.\n      IBG113029 dated 25.01.2021 would be valid only upto 24.01.2023, the\n      beneficiary/Creditor [the APDCL] would have the advantage of a claim period of 1\n      [one] year beyond the validity period upto 24.01.2023, that is, upto 24.01.2024 to\n      make a claim or demand, in writing, to the Guarantor Bank to invoke and encash\n      the said Bank Guarantee. Similarly, the Bank Guarantee bearing no. IBG113031\n      dated 25.01.2021 for a guarantee amount of Rs. 1,68,00,000/- has its expiry date\n      as 24.01.2023 and a claim period of 1 [one] year beyond 24.01.2023. The third\n      Bank Guarantee bearing no. IBG113102 dated 27.01.2021 for a guarantee\n      amount of Rs. 1,68,00,000/- has its expiry date as 26.01.2023 and a claim period\n      of 1 [one] year beyond 26.01.2023. The manner of making such claim for the\n      amounts under the Bank Guarantees is governed by the agreements itself i.e. the\n      three Bank Guarantees which have stipulated that a claim or demand in writing is\n      to be received by the respondent no. 5 Bank from the beneficiary, APDCL within 1\n      [one] year from the respective expiry date. It is not disputed by the respondent\n      no. 5 Bank that it did not receive the impugned Letter dated 01.11.2023 and the\n      impugned Letter dated 06.11.2023 from the APDCL containing the claim to invoke\n      the Bank Guarantees and the request to transfer the amounts thereof to the bank\n      account of the APDCL after encashment. Considered from that angle, it is found\n      that the claim for invocation and encashment of the three Bank Guarantees was\n      made within the respective claim period, though it was beyond the validity period\n      of the Bank Guarantees.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                                                           Page No. 46/52</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">33.   Prior to the policy decision taken by the respondent Federal Bank, as contained in\n      Circular no. 10349/CRD/IRMDC34/20-21 dated 17.06.2020, claim period of one\n      year was not mandatorily insisted by the Federal Bank while issuing guarantees.\n      As per the Circular dated 17.06.2020 [supra], the Federal Bank had taken a policy\n      decision to include one year claim period in all guarantees issued by the Bank.\n      Consequent to such inclusion of one year claim period, norms pertaining to\n      release of securities and collection of Bank Guarantee [BG] Commission were also\n      set forth as follows :- [i] Bank shall not release the cash margin and securities\n      charged to the BG until Bank is discharged from the liability i.e. till the expiry of\n      claim period; and [ii] BG Commission shall be collected for the additional period of\n      one year i.e. till the expiry of the claim period.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_94\">34.   It needs iteration at this juncture, even at the cost of repetition, that the\n      respondent APDCL authorities by the Bidding Document comprising of the RFS\n      Document and the Draft Power Purchase Agreement [PPA], had sought for the\n      Bank Guarantees in terms of Schedule 3, extracted hereinabove, from the\n      Successful Bidder/Solar Power Developer, that is, the petitioner. It was set forth\n      that such Bank Guarantees in the format provided in Schedule 3 should be\n      unconditional and irrevocable for due performance of the obligations required on\n      the part of the petitioner in terms of the Power Purchase Agreement [PPA]. After\n      having emerged as the Successful Bidder for the Region-2 Project the petitioner\n      was to obtain the Performance Security in the form of unconditional and\n      irrevocable Bank Guarantees strictly in terms of Clause 4.4 of the Power Purchase\n      Agreement [PPA] for amounts indicated therein. The respondent no. 5 Bank had\n      issued the three Bank Guarantees with their covering letters, addressed to the\n      APDCL. As per the three covering letters of the respondent no. 5 Bank - dated\n      25.01.2021, dated 25.01.2021 &amp; dated 27.01.2021 - it was informed to the\n      APDCL that the Bank was enclosing the Bank Guarantees in favour of the APDCL\n      on behalf of the petitioner. Requesting for acknowledgment of receipt of the three\n      Bank Guarantees, the APDCL authorities were advised to verify the genuineness\n      of the Bank Guarantees. From the Letter bearing Ref. no. : JK/NLP/APDCL/SOLAR\n      PROJECT/Region-2/L-05 dated 29.01.2021 of the petitioner, addressed to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                                                              Page No. 47/52</span>\n\n      respondent no. 3, it is evident that the petitioner with the said Letter had\n      submitted the original copies of the three Bank Guarantees and the respondent\n      no. 3 had acknowledged the receipt thereof under seal and signature on\n      30.01.2021. It is, thus, not open for the petitioner to say that he was not aware\n      of the contents of the three Bank Guarantees or was not aware that the Bank\n      Guarantees were not strictly in terms of the format provided in Schedule 3. It is\n      also not open for the petitioner to take a plea, after instituting the writ petition, to\n      contend that the petitioner was not aware of the condition incorporated in the\n      three Bank Guarantees as regards the claim period of one year, beyond the\n      validity period of the Bank Guarantees. The petitioner has himself annexed the\n      copies of the Bank Guarantees as annexures in the writ petition and the said fact\n      belies any contention raised on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner was not\n      aware of the condition incorporated in the Bank Guarantees regarding the claim\n      period during the period from 25.01.2021/27.01.2021 [the dates of issuance of\n      the three Bank Guarantees] and/or from 29.01.2021 [the date on which the\n      petitioner submitted the original copies of the three Bank Guarantees] till\n      06.11.2023 [the date of institution of the writ petition annexing copies of the\n      three Bank Guarantees and the copies of the covering letters of the respondent\n      no. 5 Bank as Annexure - 4-Colly].\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">35.   Assuming, arguendo, firstly, that the beneficiary/creditor of the Bank Guarantees,\n      that is, the APDCL required the Bank Guarantees only in the format provided in\n      Schedule - 3 and it had not sought incorporation of any clause regarding claim\n      period of one year beyond the validity period of the Bank Guarantees; secondly,\n      that the Principal Debtor/the petitioner had no role in incorporation of the clause\n      regarding such claim period in the Bank Guarantees; and thirdly, that the\n      respondent no. 5 Bank, that is, the Guarantor Bank had incorporated the claim\n      period unilaterally in the Bank Guarantees in terms of its policy decision contained\n      in Circular no. 10349/CRD/IRMDC34/2020-21 dated 17.06.2020; the issue which\n      has fallen for consideration is whether in the fact situation obtaining in the case,\n      more particularly, in view of the conduct of the petitioner right from the date of\n      issuance of the three Bank Guarantees i.e. 25.01.2021/27.01.2021 to the date of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                                                               Page No. 48/52</span>\n\n      issuance of the impugned Letter bearing no.

It is pertinent\n      to note that even after the impugned Letter bearing no. APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-\n      146/2019-20/787 dated 01.11.2023 did not raise any issue/protest as regards the\n      claim period of 1 [one] year in the Bank Guarantees beyond the respective validity\n      period of the Bank Guarantees. In such background, this Court has to examine as\n      to whether such conduct of the petitioner would act to his detriment in getting the\n      reliefs he has sought for. Such aspect is required to be examined on the basis of\n      the doctrine of acquiescence. The said aspect is to be considered by taking note\n      of the proposition that if one party to an agreement adds any additional term in\n      the agreement without the consent of the other party to the agreement then such\n      unilateral addition is not ordinarily binding on the other party.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">36.   As per the Oxford Dictionary of English, 3rd Edition, &#x27;acquiesce&#x27; means &#x27;to accept\n      something reluctantly but without protest&#x27; and &#x27;acquiescence&#x27; means &#x27;the reluctant\n      acceptance of something without protest&#x27;. In the Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, 9th\n      Edition, the meaning ascribed to &#x27;acquiesce&#x27; is &#x27;to accept tacitly or passively; to\n      give implied consent to [an act]&#x27; and to &#x27;acquiescence&#x27; is &#x27;a person&#x27;s tacit or\n      passive acceptance; implied consent to an act&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"212094\" id=\"span_66\">36.1.

Jal Nigam and another vs. Jaswant Singh and another</a>, reported in [2006] 11 SCC\n      464, acquiescence does not mean standing by while the violation of a right is in\n      progress, but assent after the violation has been completed and the person has\n      become aware of it. It is unjust to give such a person a remedy where, by his\n      conduct, he has done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a\n      waiver of it; or where by his conduct and neglect, though not waiving the remedy,\n      he has put the other party in a position in which it would not be reasonable to\n      place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                                           Page No. 49/52</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"143730176\" id=\"span_68\">36.2.

Murugesan and others</a>, reported in\n      [2022] 2 SCC 25. It has been held that acquiescence would mean a tacit or passive\n      acceptance. It is implied and reluctant consent to an act. In other words, such an\n      action would qualify a passive assent. Thus, when acquiescence takes place, it\n      presupposes knowledge against a particular act. From the knowledge comes\n      passive acceptance, therefore instead of taking any action against any alleged\n      refusal to perform the original contract, despite adequate knowledge of its terms,\n      and instead being allowed to continue by consciously ignoring it and thereafter\n      proceeding further, acquiescence does takes place. As a consequence, it\n      reintroduces a new implied agreement between the parties. Once such a situation\n      arises, it is not open to the party that acquiesced itself to insist upon the\n      compliance of the original terms. Hence, what is essential, is the conduct of the\n      parties.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">36.3. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15924357\" id=\"span_69\">In <a href=\"/doc/15924357/\" id=\"a_66\">Chairman, State Bank of India and another vs. M.J.

In literal sense, the term acquiescence\n      means silent assent, tacit consent, concurrence, or acceptance, which denotes\n      conduct that is evidence of an intention of a party to abandon an equitable right\n      and also to denote conduct from which another party will be justified in inferring\n      such an intention. Acquiescence can be either direct with full knowledge and\n      express approbation, or indirect where a person having the right to set aside the\n      action stands by and sees another dealing in a manner inconsistent with that right\n      and in spite of the infringement takes no action mirroring acceptance.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">37.   When the fact situation obtaining in the case is examined qua the doctrine of\n      acquiescence, it is noticeable that the petitioner as per the terms and conditions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                        Page No. 50/52</span>\n\nof the RFP/RFS Document, Draft Power Purchase Agreement and Clause 4.4\nthereof the Letter of Award [LoA] dated 04.01.2021, was required to submit\nPerformance Security in the form of Bank Guarantees, as provided in Schedule 3.\nThe three Bank Guarantees in question were issued by the respondent no. 5 Bank\nat the instance and request of the petitioner in favour of the APDCL as the\nbeneficiary/creditor on the dates - 25.01.2021, 25.01.2021 &amp; 27.01.2021. The\nrespondent no. 5 Bank had handed over the Bank Guarantees to the petitioner\nwith their covering letters on those dates. In the said Bank Guarantees, the clause\nregarding claim period which was not in Schedule 3, stood incorporated,\npurportedly unilaterally by the respondent no. 5 Bank on the basis of the policy\ndecision contained in the Circular dated 17.06.2020. The petitioner had every\nopportunity to know about incorporation of the clause regarding extended claim\nperiod in the three Bank Guarantees, beyond the respective validity period, but\nwithout making any protest or raising any issue in respect of such incorporation of\nthe clause regarding extended claim period beyond the required validity period of\n22 months the petitioner proceeded to hand over the original copies of the three\nBank   Guarantees    to   the   APDCL   by   his   Letter    bearing   reference   no.\nJK/NLP/APDCL/SOLAR        PROJECT/Region-2/L-05      dated     29.01.2021    to    the\nrespondent no. 3. The matter rested in the said position until 01.11.2023 when\nthe APDCL by the impugned Letter bearing no. APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-\n146/2019-20/787 of even date, addressed to the respondent no. 5 Bank, sought\ninvocation of the Bank Guarantees. The incorporation of the clause regarding\nclaim period of 1 [one] year beyond the validity periods of the Bank Guarantees\nwas not at the behest of the respondent APDCL but having received the Bank\nGuarantees with such claim periods the APDCL appeared to have accepted the\nsame. During the entire period from 25.01.2021/27.01.2021/29.01.2021 to\n01.11.2023/02.11.2023/06.11.2023, the petitioner despite having adequate\nknowledge about incorporation of the clause regarding the claim period in the\nBank Guarantees, had remained silent. From the fact that the petitioner has\nannexed the copies of the Bank Guarantees along with the covering letters of the\nbank in the writ petition it clearly emerges that the petitioner had the knowledge\nabout the claim periods all along for a period of more than 30 months and in such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                             Page No. 51/52</span>\n\n      situation, it is not possible to draw any other inference. When despite having\n      adequate knowledge of the clause regarding the claim periods in the Bank\n      Guarantees and when instead of making any protest or raising any issue as\n      regards such incorporation, the petitioner has been found to have allowed the\n      matter to continue which demonstrates a situation of passive acceptance and\n      assent. As a result of inaction on the part of the petitioner during the entire afore-\n      mentioned period the other parties involved with the Bank Guarantees appeared\n      to have proceeded accordingly. As the petitioner did not insist for the Bank\n      Guarantees as was originally conceived in the format provided in Schedule 3 for\n      such prolonged period and continued without making any protest or raising any\n      issue with regard to the claim period, this Court finds that the clause incorporated\n      in the Bank Guarantees regarding the claim period was with implied consent of\n      the petitioner with the operation of the doctrine of acquiescence. The doctrine of\n      acquiescence is clearly applicable in the case in hand as the petitioner having a\n      right stood by, without making any protest or raising any issue regarding the\n      claim period, and allowed the other parties dealing with the Bank Guarantees in a\n      manner which was purportedly inconsistent with the Bank Guarantees originally\n      conceived of, it is not open for the petitioner at this stage to make any complaint.\n      In the present case, it is found that it is the Bank Guarantees with clauses\n      incorporating the claim period of one year, beyond the validity period in the\n      respective Bank Guarantee, which have replaced the format provided in Schedule\n      3 originally contemplated and conceived of and as a result, it is to be held that the\n      parties involved herein are bound by such claim period.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18334360\" id=\"span_72\">38.   As the petitioner has not raised the issues of fraud or irretrievable loss or\n      injustice, this Court finds it unnecessary to advert to on those issues. In any view\n      of the matter, there are no pleadings in the writ petition as regards commission of\n      fraud of egregious nature or irretrievable loss or injustice. It is trite to say that a\n      decision is an authority for what it decides and not what can logically be deduced\n      therefrom and even a slight distinction in fact or an additional or different fact\n      may make a lot of difference in the decision making process. An act of protest\n      anterior to invocation of a bank guarantee is different from an act of protest made\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                                            Page No. 52/52</span>\n\n      subsequent to invocation of a bank guarantee. Thus, the fact situation obtaining\n      in the case of <a href=\"/doc/18334360/\" id=\"a_67\">Larsen and Toubro Limited</a> [supra] are not found similar to the case\n      in hand.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">39.   In view of the discussion made, the findings arrived at as above and the reasons\n      assigned therein, this Court is of the considered view that the petitioner has not\n      made out a case on merits for the reliefs/directions sought for in the writ petition\n      within the extraordinary, discretionary and equitable jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 226</a>\n      of the Constitution of India. Consequently, the writ petition fails. As it merits\n      dismissal, it is accordingly ordered. The interim order passed earlier stands\n      recalled. It is, therefore, held that the Letter bearing no. APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-\n      146/2019-20/787      dated    01.11.2023     and     the    Letter    bearing   no.\n      APDCL/CGM[PP&amp;D]/NRE-146/2019-20/790 dated 06.11.2023, addressed to the\n      respondent no. 5 Bank, invoking the three Bank Guarantees [IBG113029 dated\n      25.01.2021, IBG113031 dated 25.01.2021 and IBG113102 dated 27.01.2021] are\n      found to be valid as they are within the claim periods mentioned in those three\n      Bank Guarantees. As such, the respondent no. 5 Bank has to proceed in terms of\n      the said Bank Guarantees for honouring them. There shall, however, be no order\n      as to cost.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">                                                                                 JUDGE\n\n\n\n      Comparing Assistant\n </p>","numcites":20,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Gauhati High Court","citetid":8468586,"divtype":"judgments","courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
