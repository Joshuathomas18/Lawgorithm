In terms of clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 7-B of\n       the Act, the reference is required to be made within one year from the date of\n       communication of the decision of the final Authority whereas, in terms of the\n       proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 7-B of the Act, the final Authority has six\n       months&#x27; time to take a decision.\n\n       The law of limitation is a statutory right and therefore, each word of the statute\n       has to be given its natural meaning. Therefore, the proviso to Sub-section (1) of\n                                                                            AR No. 02/2016\n                                             2\n\n       Section 7-B of the Act would be applicable in a situation where final Authority\n       has not given any decision within six months from the date of reference to it.\n\n       The proviso to Sub-section (1) of Section 7-B of the Act is explicit granting six\n       months&#x27; time to the final Authority to decide the matter and thereafter right has\n       been conferred on the aggrieved person to seek reference. If the decision is not\n       taken within six months, it amounts to deemed rejection of the claim and thus,\n       cause of action to an aggrieved person is complete if the final Authority fails to\n       decide the dispute within six months. The period of limitation in terms of Sub-\n       section (1)(b) of Section 7-B of the Act is one year from the date of decision of\n       the final Authority but in case the final Authority is unable to decide within six\n       months, the cause of action will be complete to an aggrieved person to invoke the\n       jurisdiction of the Tribunal within one year after the expiry of six months.\n\n       Once the period of limitation under the Act starts, it would not stand revived by\n       subsequent decision of the final Authority after the expiry of limitation in terms of\n       Sub-section (1)(b) of Section 7-B of the Act even if the Arbitral Tribunal is not a\n       court to which <a href=\"/doc/268914/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 9</a> of the Limitation Act would be applicable but because,\n       the principle is based upon common law and is just and equitable as well. - (2006)\n       12 SCC 709 (State of Punjab v. Balkaran Singh), 1970 Lab IC 701 (Jaswant\n       Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Naubat) and AIR 1968 Mad. 161 (Joseph Carlos v. Stanislaus\n       Costa) - Relied.\n\n       A reference which has become barred by limitation in view of the statutory\n       provision, cannot be revived. In other words, if an aggrieved person has failed to\n       seek reference within one year of the final decision of the Authority or after\n       deemed decision of the final Authority within six months of making a reference,\n       the remedy to seek resolution of dispute stands exhausted.\n\n       Conferring cause of action on an aggrieved person to invoke the jurisdiction of\n       the Tribunal as and when the final Authority decides the matter is doing violence\n       to the provision of Sub-section (1)(b) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act. The Legislative\n       provision cannot be set at naught by such a queer reasoning. The Division Bench\n       Judgment in Ram Niwas Shukla v.

This section further\n        provides that where a dispute has been referred to the final authority\n        under the agreement and such authority fails to decide it within a period\n        of six months from the date of dispute unless the reference petition is\n        made within one year from the date of expiry of said period of six\n        months. Thus, reference petition can be filed after the dispute is referred\n        to final authority and, if the final authority fails to decide the dispute\n        with a period of six months then the period of limitation shall start\n        running on expiry of six months from the date of dispute and period of\n        limitation is one year.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                          AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           7</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        7.   In the present case, dispute was submitted to the Superintending\n        Engineer on 18-5-1991. It was not adjudicated within a period of six\n        months. Therefore, cause of action started running with effect from\n        18-11-1991 and the dispute ought to have been filed on or before\n        18-11-1991. Claimant continued to wait for the decision and is claiming\n        benefit of final orders passed by the Superintending Engineer dated\n        22-7-1994.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8690282\" id=\"span_11\">Question is whether the contractor will be entitled for fresh period\n        of limitation with effect from 22-7-1994. This question came up for\n        consideration before this Court in the case of M/s Virendra Construction\n        &amp; Engineering Com., Mungaoli, Distt. <a href=\"/doc/8690282/\" id=\"a_11\">Guna vs. State of M. P. and\n        others</a> (Civil Revision No. 136/1996 decided by Division Bench of this\n        Court on 27-2-2004) and after interpreting section 7-B of the Adhiniyam\n        that the period of limitation shall commence on the expiry of six months\n        from the date of reference of dispute to the final authority. The language\n        of the section is plain and simple. From bare reading of section 7-B it is\n        clear that section 7-B(1)(a) and 7-B(1)(b) are not independent of each\n        other. Petitioner cannot claim benefit of limitation from the date of final\n        order which is not passed within stipulated period of six months.

After enactment of <a href=\"/doc/99408546/\" id=\"a_15\">section 7-B(1)(a)</a> of the\n        Act, 1983, it is now the requirement of the law to the applicant to firstly\n        refer the matter as required under Clause (a) of sub-section (1).\n        Thereafter Clause (b) of sub-section (1) provides that the petition to the\n        Tribunal shall be made within one year from the date of communication\n        of the decision of the final authority, meaning thereby the petitioner is\n        entitled to file a reference petition within one year from the date of\n        communication of the decision of the final authority. The provision\n        further provide that if the final authority fails to decide the dispute\n        within a period of 6 months from the date of reference to it, the petition\n        to the Tribunal shall be made within a year of the expiry of the period of\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_9\">        6 months, but it does not provide that in case the final authority decides\n        the matter after a period of 6 months, there shall be a bar to file\n        reference application thereafter. If the petitioner takes a risk and awaits\n        the decision of the final authority and final authority after a period of 6\n        months decides the matter, the petitioner if dissatisfied with the final\n        decision is entitled to file a petition to the Tribunal within a year from\n        the date of communication of the decision under Clause (b) of Sub-\n        section (1). Section 7-B also does not provide that the final authority\n        shall decide the matter within a period of 6 months and not thereafter.\n        The final authority has not been restricted to take final decision within a\n        period of 6 months, then how the petitioner can be restricted to file a\n        petition after the decision of the final authority even if it is after six\n        months from the date of reference to it.

A harmonious construction of\n        the aforesaid provision is that the petitioner after awaiting 6 months\n        from the date of a reference to the final authority shall be entitled to file\n        reference petition to the Tribunal within one year of the expiry of the\n        said period of 6 months.

It is argued that the &quot;dispute&quot; as defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/115052/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act, is required to be referred to the final Authority. Since\n\nthere is no provision mandating the final Authority to take a decision, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                 AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                      10</span>\n\nfailure of the final Authority to decide the dispute within six months will not\n\nnon-suit an aggrieved person.

Therefore, if the dispute is not decided, the\n\npetitioner cannot be barred from raising reference after the decision of the\n\nfinal Authority. It is also argued that Sub-section (2-A) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 7-B</a> of the\n\nAct starts with a non obstante clause, which gives outer period of three years\n\nfor raising dispute before a statutory Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, the\n\nprovisions of Section (2-A) will be preferred as against the provisions of\n\nSub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"119414320\" id=\"span_20\">8.

It has the power to decide as to whether the Tribunal\n        has misconducted itself or the proceedings or has made an award which\n        is invalid in law or has been improperly procured by any party to the\n        proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">        16.

It is trite law that provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_45\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> shall apply\n        to a court. It has no application in regard to a tribunal or persona\n        designata. There exists a distinction between a court and the Tribunal.\n        The very fact that the authorities under the Act are empowered to\n        examine witnesses after administering oath to them clearly shows that\n        they are &quot;court&quot; within the meaning of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_46\">Evidence Act</a>.

The Tribunal has been confirmed (sic conferred with) various\npowers.

The provisions of the Act referred to hereinbefore clearly postulate\nthat the State of Madhya Pradesh has created a separate forum for the\npurpose of determination of disputes arising inter alia out of the works\ncontract. The Tribunal is not one which can be said to be a domestic\ntribunal. The Members of the Tribunal are not nominated by the parties.\nThe disputants do not have any control over their appointment. The\nTribunal may reject a reference at the threshold. It has the power to\nsummon records. It has the power to record evidence. Its functions are\nnot limited to one Bench. The Chairman of the Tribunal can refer the\ndisputes to another Bench. Its decision is final. It can award costs. It can\naward interests. The finality of the decision is fortified by a legal fiction\ncreated by making an award a decree of a civil court. It is executable as\na decree of a civil court. The award of the Arbitral Tribunal is not\nsubject to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_54\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_55\">Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.

The Supreme Court held that the &quot;Tribunal&quot; is a &quot;Court&quot;, but,\n\nreferred the matter to Larger Bench to decide the question: as to whether, the\n\ncase of Nagarpalika Parishad, Morena v. Agrawal Construction Co.\n\n[SLP (C) No.21349 of 2003 decided on 27.08.2004), was correctly decided.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"171458108\" id=\"span_51\">The Larger Bench considered the question raised in a Judgment rendered in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/171458108/\" id=\"a_56\">State of Madhya Pradesh and another v. Anshuman Shukla</a>, (2014) 10\n\nSCC 814 (for short &quot;Anshuman Shukla-II&quot;). The Court examined the\n\nquestion: whether the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_57\">Limitation Act</a> are applicable to the\n\nprovisions of the Act.

On the contrary, the\n        High Court is conferred with suo motu power, to call for the record of an\n        award at any time. It cannot, therefore, be said that the legislative intent\n        was to exclude the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act to\n        <a href=\"/doc/1375684/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 19</a> of the 1983 Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">        33. In our opinion, it is unnecessary to delve into the question whether\n        the Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the Act is a court or not for\n        answering the issue in the present case as the delay in filing the revision\n        has occurred before the High Court, and not the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">        34. In light of the reasons recorded above, we are of the opinion that the\n        case of Nagar Palika Parishad, Morena (supra) was decided\n        erroneously. <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act is applicable to <a href=\"/doc/1375684/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 19</a>\n        of the 1983 Act. No express exclusion has been incorporated therein,\n        and there is neither any evidence to suggest that the legislative intent\n        was to bar the application of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act on <a href=\"/doc/1375684/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n        19</a> of the 1983 Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"487135\" id=\"span_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"781949\" id=\"span_53\">The cases which were relied upon to dismiss the\n        special leave petition, namely, <a href=\"/doc/781949/\" id=\"a_65\">Nasiruddin and others v.

Thus, it is beyond doubt that the &quot;Tribunal&quot; is a &quot;Court&quot; as it has\n\nbeen held that <a href=\"/doc/1375684/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 19</a> of the Act does not contain any express rider on\n\nthe power of the High Court to entertain an application for revision after\n\nexpiry of the prescribed period of three months. It cannot, therefore, be said\n\nthat the legislative intent was to exclude the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 5</a> of the\n\nLimitation Act to <a href=\"/doc/1375684/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 19</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"409511\" id=\"span_56\">15.     The two principles in respect of applicability of law of limitation\n\nneed to be stated first. It is well settled that the time does not stop to run\n\nonce it has started to run. Reference may be made to a Judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court rendered in the case of <a href=\"/doc/409511/\" id=\"a_70\">State of Punjab and Another v.\n\nBalkaran Singh</a>, (2006) 12 SCC 709.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">16.

Therefore, when the cause of action of the suit arose, viz., when\n        the trust properties were alienated by the first defendant to the tenth\n        defendant, plaintiff&#x27;s father was in existence and he was a proper person\n        capable of suing to set aside the sale, and limitation did begin to run\n        from the date of sale. When once time has begun to run owing to the\n        right to sue having accrued to the person who was not labouring under\n        any legal disability, the subsequent disability of himself or of his son or\n        other representative is not a ground of exemption from the operation of\n        the ordinary rule.

It\n\nwas held that the principle that &quot;once limitation starts running, it cannot be\n\nstopped on account of the disability or inability of the parties&quot; is not only\n\nprinciple contained in <a href=\"/doc/268914/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 9</a> of the Limitation Act, but, is also a common\n\nlaw principle. The Court held as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">        &quot;9. The applicant&#x27;s contention that once time starts to run, it cannot be\n        stopped is based on the provisions of Section 9 of the Indian Limitation\n        Act, 1908, which provides:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">             &quot;9.

It is unnecessary to go into this controversy, as apart from\n        <a href=\"/doc/268914/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 9</a>, the Common law also recognises the principle that once\n        limitation starts running, it cannot be stopped on account of the\n        disability or inability of the parties. Disability or inability is something\n        personal to the plaintiff or the applicant. Disability has been defined as\n        want of qualification to act and inability as want of physical power to\n        act; but lack or absence of the cause of action is neither disability nor,\n        inability. <a href=\"/doc/268914/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 9</a> as well as the principle of continuous running of time\n        contemplate cases where the cause of action continues to exist. They\n        cannot apply to cases where the cause of action is cancelled by\n        subsequent events..........&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">18.     Thus, once the period of limitation under the Act has started, it\n\nwould not stand revived by subsequent decision of the final Authority after\n\nthe expiry of limitation in terms of Sub-section (1)(b) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 7-B</a> of the\n\nAct.

The second principle of law of limitation is that it is to compel a\n\nperson to exercise his right of action within a reasonable time as also to\n\ndiscourage and suppress stale, fake or fraudulent claims. One aspect relates\n\nto the extinguishment of the right if a claim or action is not commenced with\n\na particular time and the other merely bars the claim without affecting the\n\nright which either remains merely as a moral obligation or can be availed of\n\nto furnish the consideration for a fresh enforceable obligation. The Supreme\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/494781/\" id=\"a_81\">Bharat Barrel and Drum Mfg. Co. Ltd. and another v. The\n\nEmployees State Insurance Corporation</a>, (1971) 2 SCC 860, held as\n\nunder:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">          &quot;7. The manner of this approach may be open to the criticism of having\n          over-simplified the distinction, but nonetheless this will enable us to\n          grasp the essential requisites of each of the concepts which at any rate\n          &quot;has been found to be a workable concept to point out the real and valid\n          difference between the rules in which stability is of prime importance\n          and those in which flexibility is a more important value. American\n          Jurisprudence, Vol. 51 (Second Edn.), 605. Keeping these basic\n          assumptions in view it will be appropriate to examine whether the topic\n          of limitation belongs to the Branch of procedural law or is outside it. If\n          it is a part of the procedure whether the entire topic is covered by it or\n          only a part of it and if so what part of it and the tests for ascertaining\n          them. The law of limitation appertains to remedies because the rule is\n          that claims in respect of rights cannot be entertained if not commenced\n          within the time prescribed by the statute in respect of that right. Apart\n          from Legislative action prescribing the time, there is no period of\n          limitation recognised under the general law and therefore any time fixed\n          by the statute is necessarily to be arbitrary. A statute prescribing\n          limitation however does not confer a right of action nor speaking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                                   AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                   20</span>\n\ngenerally does not confer on a person a right to relief which has been\nbarred by efflux of time prescribed by the law. The necessity for\nenacting periods of limitation is to ensure that actions are commenced\nwithin a particular period, firstly to assure the availability of evidence\ndocumentary as well as oral to enable the defendant to contest the claim\nagainst him; secondly to give effect to the principle that law does not\nassist a person who is inactive and sleeps over his rights by allowing\nthem when challenged or disputed to remain dormant without asseting\nthem in a court of law. The principle which forms the basis of this rule is\nexpressed in the maximum vigilantibus, non dermientibus, jura\nsubveniunt (the laws give help to those who are watchful and not to\nthose who sleep). Therefore the object of the statutes of limitations is to\ncompel a person to exercise his right of action within a reasonable time\nas also to discourage and suppress stale, fake or fraudulent claims.\nWhile this is so there are two aspects of the statutes of limitation the one\nconcerns the extinguishment of the right if a claim or action is not\ncommenced with a particular time and the other merely bare the claim\nwithout affecting the right which either remains merely as a moral\nobligation or can be availed of to furnish the consideration for a fresh\nenforceable obligation. Where a statute, prescribing the limitation\nextinguishes the right, it affects substantive rights while that which\npurely pertains to the commencement of action without touching the\nright is said to be procedural. According to Salmond the law of\nprocedure is that branch of the law of actions which governs the process\nof litigation, both civil and criminal. &quot;All the residue&quot; he says &quot;is\nsubstantive law, and relation not to the process of litigation but to its\npurposes and subject-matter&quot;. It may be stated that much water has\nflown under the bridges since the original English theory justifying a\nstatute of limitation on the ground that a debt long overdue was\npresumed to have been paid and discharged or that such statutes are\nmerely procedural. Historically there was a period when substantive law\nwas inextricably intermixed with procedure; at a later period procedural\nlaw seems to have reigned supreme when forms of action ruled. In the\nwords of Maine &quot;so great is the ascendancy of the Law of Actions in the\ninfancy of Courts of Justice, that substantive law has at first the look of\nbeing gradually secreted in the interstices of procedure&quot; Maine, Early\nLaw and Custom, 389.

The Court held that once it is\n\nheld that the suit for possession of the suit properties filed at the instance of\n\nthe Wakf were barred under the Limitation Act, 1908, the necessary\n\ncorollary would be to hold that the right of the Wakf to the suit properties\n\nstood extinguished in view of <a href=\"/doc/1223371/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 27</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 and,\n\ntherefore, when <a href=\"/doc/34115051/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 107</a> of the Wakf Act came into force, it could not\n\nrevive the extinguished rights.

From the above, it is clear that the right of action, which is barred\n        by limitation at the time when the new Act comes into force, cannot be\n        revived by the change in the law subsequently. In Ram Murti v. Puran\n        Singh, AIR 1963 Pun 393, it has been held that Section 107 renders the\n        <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_87\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> inapplicable to suits for possession of immovable\n        properties comprised in any wakf or any interest therein but the right of\n        a person to institute such a suit which is already barred at the\n        commencement of this Act cannot revive. It was further held that his\n        title is extinguished and a good title is acquired by the person in\n        possession and that where the title of the true owner is extinguished in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                                     AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                     22</span>\n\nfavour of the wrongdoer, it is not revived by that person again getting\ninto possession.

In the present case, as noted hereinearlier, the trial court had held\nthat the suits were barred under Article 134-B of the Limitation Act,\n1908 and, therefore, since the suits were barred under the 1908 Act, in\nview of <a href=\"/doc/1301998/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 31</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963, <a href=\"/doc/1018551/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 96</a> of the 1963\nAct could not be applied. <a href=\"/doc/1301998/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 31</a> was overlooked by the first\nappellate court. Therefore, in our view, when the right stood\nextinguished, Section 107 cannot have the effect of reviving the\nextinguished right/claim. This principle has also been followed in\n<a href=\"/doc/1390831/\" id=\"a_91\">Karnataka Steel &amp; Wire Products v.

Limitation is a statute of repose. It ordinarily bars a\n       remedy, but, does not extinguish a right.

An extinction of right, as contemplated by the provisions of\n       the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_94\">Limitation Act</a>, prima facie would be attracted in all types of\n       suits. The Schedule appended to the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_95\">Limitation Act</a>, as\n       prescribed by the articles, provides that upon lapse of the\n       prescribed period, the institution of a suit will be barred. <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_96\">Section\n       3</a> of the Limitation Act provides that irrespective of the fact as\n       to whether any defence is set out or is raised by the defendant or\n       not, in the event a suit is found to be barred by limitation, every\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                         AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                          23</span>\n\n             suit instituted, appeal preferred and every application made after\n             the prescribed period shall be dismissed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">        52.

In view of the above authorities, we are of the view that in the\n        present case, once it is held that the suit for possession of the suit\n        properties filed at the instance of the Wakf were barred under the\n        Limitation Act, 1908, the necessary corollary would be to hold that the\n        right of the Wakf to the suit properties stood extinguished in view of\n        <a href=\"/doc/1223371/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 27</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 and, therefore, when Section 107\n        came into force, it could not revive the extinguished rights. The\n        authorities relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents in this\n        regard in <a href=\"/doc/503795/\" id=\"a_98\">Sree Bank Ltd. v. Sarkar Dutt Roy &amp; Co.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1537183/\" id=\"a_99\">AIR 1966 SC 1953,\n        Dhannalal v. D.P.

As per the said judgements, if an aggrieved person has not availed\n\nthe remedy within the period of limitation, the right to sue stands\n\nextinguished.

The Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/68571/\" id=\"a_102\">Dwarka Prasad</a>&#x27;s case (supra) held that\n\nthe rulings and text books bearing on statutory construction have assigned\n\nmany functions for provisos but the proviso is to be interpreted having\n\nregard to the text and context of a statute. The Court held as under:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">        &quot;16. There is some validity in this submission but if, on a fair\n        construction, the principal provision is clear, a proviso cannot expand or\n        limit it. Sometimes a proviso is engrafted by an apprehensive draftsman\n        to remove possible doubts, to make matters plain, to light up ambiguous\n        edges. Here, such is the case. In a country where factories and industries\n        may still be in the developmental stage, it is not unusual to come across\n        several such units which may not have costly machinery or plant or\n        fittings and superficially consist of bare buildings plus minor fixtures.\n        For example, a beedi factory or handicraft or carpentry unit -- a few\n        tools, some small contrivances or collection of materials housed in a\n        building, will superficially look like a mere &quot;accommodation&quot; but\n        actually be a humming factory or business with a goodwill as business,\n        with a prosperous reputation and a name among the business community\n        and customers. Its value is qua business, although it has a habitation or\n        building to accommodate it. The personality of the thing let out is a\n        going concern or enterprise, not a lifeless edifice. The Legislature, quite\n        conceivably, thought that a marginal, yet substantial, class of buildings,\n        with minimal equipments may still be good businesses and did not\n        require protection as in the case of ordinary building tenancies. So, to\n        dispel confusion from this region and to exclude what seemingly might\n        be leases only of buildings but in truth might be leases of businesses, the\n        Legislature introduced the exclusionary proviso.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">        17. While rulings and text books bearing on statutory construction\n        have assigned many functions for provisos, we have to be selective,\n        having regard to the text and context of a statute. Nothing is gained by\n        extensive references to luminous classics or supportive case-law. Having\n        explained the approach we make to the specific &quot;proviso&quot; situation in\n        <a href=\"/doc/1805192/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act, what strikes us as meaningful here is that the\n        Legislature by the amending Act clarified what was implicit earlier and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                                                         AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                          25</span>\n\n        expressly carved out what otherwise might be mistakenly covered by the\n        main definition. The proviso does not, in this case, expand, by\n        implication, the protected area of building tenancies to embrace\n        &quot;business&quot; leases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">25.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"922039\" id=\"span_81\">In <a href=\"/doc/922039/\" id=\"a_104\">Tribhovandas Haribhai Tamboli</a>&#x27;s case (supra), the Supreme\n\nCourt held that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces\n\nthe field, which is covered by the main provision. It carves out an exception\n\nto the main provision to which it has been enacted by the proviso and to no\n\nother. The proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case\n\nwhich would otherwise fall within the general language of the main\n\nenactment, and its effect is to confine to that case.

The proper\n        function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would\n        otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment, and its\n        effect is to confine to that case. Where the language of the main\n        enactment is explicit and unambiguous, the proviso can have no\n        repercussion on the interpretation of the main enactment, so as to\n        exclude from it, by implication what clearly falls within its express\n        terms. The scope of the proviso, therefore, is to carve out an exception\n        to the main enactment and it excludes something which otherwise would\n        have been within the rule. It has to operate in the same field and if the\n        language of the main enactment is clear, the proviso cannot be torn apart\n        from the main enactment nor can it be used to nullify by implication\n        what the enactment clearly says nor set at naught the real object of the\n        main enactment, unless the words of the proviso are such that it is its\n        necessary effect.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">26.

The Tribunal gets the jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute under\n        the Act, but for the Act, it would have no jurisdiction to adjudicate the\n        dispute in relation to works contract. It is well settled in law that where a\n        tribunal derives its jurisdiction from the statute that creates it and that\n        statute also defines the conditions under which the tribunal can function,\n        it goes without saying that before that tribunal assumes jurisdiction in a\n        matter, it must be satisfied that the conditions requisite for its acquiring\n        seisin of that matter have in fact arisen. Wherever jurisdiction is given to\n        a Court by an Act of Legislature and such jurisdiction is only given upon\n        certain specified terms contained in that Act it is a universal principle\n        that these terms must be complied with, in order to create and raise the\n        jurisdiction for if they be not complied with, the jurisdiction does not\n        arise. [See: <a href=\"/doc/157214/\" id=\"a_110\">Mohammed Hasnuddin v. State of Maharashtra</a>, (1979) 2\n        SCC 572]. In view of aforesaid enunciation of law, it is apparent that in\n        case where an agreement provides for clause like Clause 29, the\n        jurisdiction of the Tribunal can be invoked only after approaching the\n        authority as provided under the terms of the work contract. <a href=\"/doc/392398/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 7-</a>\n        B(1) in express terms provides that the Tribunal shall not admit a\n        reference petition unless the dispute is first referred for decision of the\n        final authority under the terms of the contract and that the petition to the\n        Tribunal is made within one year from the date of communication of the\n        decision of the final authority. The proviso to sub-section (1) of section\n        7-B provides that if the final authority fails to decide the dispute within\n        the period of six months from the date of reference to it, the petition to\n        the Tribunal shall be made within one year of the expiry of said period\n        of six months. Thus, it is necessary for an person aggrieved to approach\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                                     AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                    28</span>\n\nthe authority under the terms of the work contract before filing the\nreference petition.

There may be cases where the works contract may not contain any\nprovision for dispute redressal like the one provided in Clause 29 of the\nAgreement. In such a case, sub-section (2-A) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_113\">section 7-B</a> of the Act\nwill apply and an aggrieved person can approach the Tribunal within\nthree years from the date on which the works contract is terminated,\nforeclosed, abandoned or comes to an end in any other manner or when\na dispute arises during the pendency of the works contract. It is pertinent\nto note that section 7-B(2-A) as it exists today has come into force w.e.f.\n29-8-2005. The aforesaid provisions does not have retrospective\noperation as the language employed therein does not even remotely\nsuggest so, as has been held by the Full Bench in its order dated 27-10-\n2009.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">***                          ***                                      ***\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1786180\" id=\"span_93\">9.    The first part of Clause 29 of the agreement provides for a dispute\nresolution mechanism. It provides that the dispute has to be referred to\nthe Superintending Engineer in writing for decision within a period of\n30 days from such occurrence. Thereupon, the Superintending Engineer\nshall give his written instructions or decision within a period of 60 days\nof such request. If the Superintending Engineer fails to give his\ninstructions in writing within a period of 60 days or mutually agreed\ntime after being requested of, an aggrieved party may file an appeal to\nthe Chief Engineer within 30 days and shall give his decision within a\nperiod of 90 days.

If the final authority fails to decide the dispute within\na period of six months from the date of reference to it, the petition to the\nTribunal shall be made within one year of the expiry period of six\nmonths. The contention made on behalf of the applicants that in view of\nsub-section (2-A) of section 7-B, an aggrieved person can approach the\nTribunal directly without approaching the authorities mentioned in\nClause 29 of the agreement, cannot be accepted as the same would\nobliterate the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 7- B and would\nrender the same otiose as it is well settled legal proposition that it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                         AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                          29</span>\n\n        incumbent on the Court to avoid a construction if reasonably permissible\n        on the language which would render part of the statute devoid of any\n        meaning or application.

The law of limitation cannot be left on uncertainties as to whenever\n\nthe final Authority decides; the cause of action will arise to an aggrieved\n\nperson to seek reference. The law of limitation is a statutory right and\n\ntherefore, each word of the statute has to be given its natural meaning. The\n\nproviso is explicit granting six months&#x27; time to the final Authority to decide\n\nthe matter and thereafter right has been conferred on the aggrieved person to\n\nseek reference. If the decision is not taken within six months, it amounts to\n\ndeemed rejection of the claim and thus, cause of action to an aggrieved\n\nperson is complete if the final Authority fails to decide the dispute within six\n\nmonths. The Judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1387209/\" id=\"a_147\">Ram Niwas Shukla</a>&#x27;s case (supra) is\n\nbased upon &#x27;ifs&#x27; and &#x27;buts&#x27;, which is not the basis of determining the period\n\nof limitation to avail a legal remedy.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1387209\" id=\"span_119\">In <a href=\"/doc/1387209/\" id=\"a_148\">Ram Niwas Shukla</a>&#x27;s case (supra) it\n\nhas been held that when the final Authority has not been restricted to take a\n\nfinal decision within six months then how the petitioner can be restricted to\n\nfile a petition after decision of the final Authority, is misreading of the\n\nprovision of law. The period of limitation in terms of Sub-section (1)(b) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act is one year from the date of decision of the final\n\nAuthority but in case the final Authority is unable to decide within six\n\nmonths, the cause of action will be complete to an aggrieved person to\n\ninvoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal within one year thereafter.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                                 AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                      33</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"119414320\" id=\"span_122\">34.

In other words, if an aggrieved person has\n\nfailed to seek reference within one year of the final decision of the Authority\n\nor after deemed decision of the final Authority within six months of making\n\na reference, the remedy to seek resolution of dispute stands exhausted.</span></span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1387209\" id=\"span_126\">Therefore, we hold that proviso to Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act\n\nwould be applicable in a situation where final Authority has not given any\n\ndecision within six months from the date of reference to it.

Executive\n\nEngineer, PWD</a>, (2018) 3 MPLJ 163 wherein Judgment of the Supreme\n\nCourt in Civil Appeal No.4017/2018 (M/s <a href=\"/doc/165163764/\" id=\"a_162\">Gangotri Enterprises Ltd. vs.\n\nMadhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation and Another</a>) decided\n\non 18.04.2018 was referred to, wherein it has been held that &quot;ascertained\n\nmoney&quot; means &quot;ascertained money arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal at the\n\ntime of adjudication of the claim&quot;. The relevant extract of the Full Bench\n\ndecision reads as under:-</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">         &quot;46. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"165163764\" id=\"span_131\">In fact, in Civil Appeal No.4017/2018 (M/s <a href=\"/doc/165163764/\" id=\"a_163\">Gangotri Enterprises\n         Ltd. vs. Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation and Another</a>)\n         decided on 18.04.2018, the Supreme Court held that the expression\n         &quot;ascertained money&quot; as used in Section 2(1)(d) of the State Act will\n         include not only the amount already ascertained but the amount, which\n         may be ascertained during the proceedings on the basis of the\n         claims/counter claims of the parties.

Our attention has been drawn to the definition of &quot;dispute&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">             under <a href=\"/doc/115052/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Madhya Pradesh Madhyastham\n             Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 (&quot;1983 Act&quot;) which is as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">                   &quot;&#x27;dispute&#x27; means claim of ascertained money valued at\n                   Rupees 50,000 or more relating to any difference arising\n                   out of the execution or non-execution of a works contract\n                   or part thereof.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                      AR No. 02/2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                          35</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">             3. We consider it appropriate to clarify that the expression\n             &quot;ascertained money&quot; as used in <a href=\"/doc/115052/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 2(d)</a> of the 1983 Act\n             will include not only the amount already ascertained but the\n             amount which may be ascertained during the proceedings on the\n             basis of claims/counter claims of the parties.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">         Therefore, in addition to the consequential relief which an aggrieved\n         person has to claim in a reference under Section 7-A of the State Act\n         even the expression &quot;ascertained money&quot; includes the amount which\n         may be ascertained during the proceedings on the basis of the\n         claims/counter claims of the parties. The said order concludes that\n         ascertained amount is not only the claim raised but also the amount\n         determined.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">37.     Therefore, any dispute in respect of works-contract as defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/115052/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act is required to be referred for the decision of the final\n\nAuthority in terms of clause 29 of the agreement in question. In terms of\n\nclause (b) of Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act, the reference is\n\nrequired to be made within one year from the date of communication of the\n\ndecision of the final Authority. The proviso gives six months to the final\n\nAuthority to take a decision. If the final Authority fails to take a decision\n\nwithin six months, it amounts to deemed rejection of the reference of an\n\naggrieved person. Thus, cause of action crystallises on the expiry of six\n\nmonths from the date of reference to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">38.     Thus, the question framed is answered that the proviso to Sub-\n\nsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act would be applicable even if the final\n\nAuthority has not given any decision within six months as the failure to\n\ndecide within six months leads to deemed rejection of the claim.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">39.
