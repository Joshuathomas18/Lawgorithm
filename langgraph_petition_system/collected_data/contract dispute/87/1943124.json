The said \nagreement was entered into on or about 26th August, 1993. As per \nthe original agreement, the payment for such tea exported was to \nbe made by the Kazak Corporation by barter of goods mentioned \nin the Schedule to the said agreement, within 120 days of the date \nof delivery by the exporter. The agreement also provided that such \npayment to be made by the Kazak Corporation is to be guaranteed \nby the Government of Kazakhstan. Clause 6 of the agreement \nwhich provided for the mode of payment by barter of goods by the \nKazak Corporation came to be amended by an addendum on the \nvery same day when the original agreement was executed. By the \namended agreement, it was specifically provided that if the \ncontract of barter of goods cannot be finalised for any reason then \nthe Kazak Corporation was to pay to the exporter for the goods \nreceived by it in US Dollars within 120 days from the date of the \ndelivery. Such payment was to be remitted by the Kazak \nCorporation to the bank account of the exporter at Delhi. This \namended agreement also provided for a guarantee being given by \nthe Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Kazakhstan for \nprompt payment of such consideration. The addendum specifically \nstated that the same was to form an integral part of the contract \nearlier entered between the parties on the same day viz. 26.8.1993.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\tAfter the said contract was entered into by the 4th respondent \nwith the Kazak Corporation, by an agreement of parties, the 4th \nrespondent assigned a part of the said export contract to the first  \nappellant herein on same terms. On a direction issued by the \nReserve Bank of India to cover the risk arising out of the export of \ntea made by the appellants as per the said assigned contract, the \nappellants approached the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of \nIndia Ltd. (the first respondent herein) on 23rd September, 1993 to \ninsure the risk of payment of consideration that is involved in the \nsaid contract of export. On 30th  September, 1993, after \nconsiderable correspondence between the parties, the first \nrespondent issued a comprehensive risk policy effective from 23rd  \nSeptember, 1993 to 30th September, 1995 covering the risk. The \nKazakhstan Government as required in the contract through its \nMinistry of Foreign Economic Relations also gave an irrevocable \nguarantee that in the event the Kazak Corporation for any reason \nwhatsoever is unable to meet its obligation of payment due under \nthe contract, said Government would make the payment to the \nexporter in US dollars through remittance for tea delivered. It is the \ncase of the appellant that the payment of consideration by barter of \ngoods could not be finalised between the appellant and the Kazak \nCorporation, therefore, the said Corporation agreed to pay the \nconsideration amount for the goods received by it in US dollars \nand also paid certain sums of money in US dollars as part payment \nbut failed to pay the balance amount due under the contract. It is \nalso the case of the appellant that even the Kazakhstan \nGovernment though admitted its liability to pay the balance of \nconsideration amount did not fulfil its part of the guarantee given \nin the contract due to lack of funds. It is on the failure of the \nKazakhstan Government to fulfil its guarantee the appellants made \na claim on the first respondent which had covered the said risk of \ncompensating the loss suffered by it by the non-payment of the \nconsideration amount for the supply of tea made to the Kazak \nCorporation. The first respondent as per its letter dated 14.12.1994, \nhowever, repudiated the claim of the appellants stating that the \nappellants had changed the terms of the contract of payment \nwithout first consulting it, therefore, it had no obligation to \ncompensate the appellants for the loss suffered by it. This alleged \nchange of terms of the contract, according to the first respondent, \nwas due to the fact that the appellants had rejected the barter offer \nmade by the Kazak Corporation and had opted for cash payment in \nUS dollars which, according to the first respondent was not the \nmode of payment contemplated in the contract between the \nexporter and the Kazak Corporation. On further correspondence \nbetween the appellants and the first respondent, the latter reiterated \nits right to repudiate the claim of the appellants by its second letter \ndated 26.5.1995 contending that the refusal of the barter offer by \nthe appellants without first consulting it, amounts to a change in \nthe mode of recovery of dues, hence, the loss suffered by such \nchange in the mode of recovery took away the liability of the first \nrespondent to pay for such loss. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">          Having failed to persuade the first respondent to adhere to \nthe contract of insurance between it and the appellant, the appellant \nfiled a writ petition before a learned Single Judge of the Calcutta \nHigh Court, inter alia, praying for quashing of the letters of \nrepudiation issued by the first respondent. It also consequentially \nprayed for a direction to the first respondent to make payment of \nthe dues to it under the contract of insurance. The learned Single \nJudge after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that though \nthe dispute between the parties arose out of a contract, the first \nrespondent being a State for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 12</a>, was bound \nby the terms of the contract, therefore, for such non-performance, a \nwrit was maintainable and after considering the arguments of the \nparties in regard to the liability under the contract of insurance, \nallowed the writ petition and issued the writ and directions as \nprayed for by the appellants in the writ petition. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">          In an appeal filed by the first respondent before the \nAppellate Bench of the same High Court, the said Bench reversed \nthe findings of the learned Single Judge and held that the claim of \nthe appellant involving disputed questions of fact cannot be \nadjudicated in a writ proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the \nConstitution, hence, set aside the judgment of the learned Single \nJudge. In the course of its judgment the Appellate Bench also \nincidentally came to the conclusion that the first respondent had \nnot committed any violation of the clauses or the terms of the \ninsurance contract. On the contrary, it observed that as per proviso \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">(d) to Clause (xi) of the said insurance contract, by refusing to \naccept the barter of goods, the first appellant had violated the terms \nof the contract disentitling it to raise any claim on the first \nrespondent. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">          It is against this order of the Appellate Bench of the Calcutta \nHigh Court that the appellants are before us. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">          In this appeal, Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel for \nthe appellants contended that the High Court though noted that the \nwrit petition involved disputed questions of fact has not identified \nany such disputed questions of fact which disentitled the appellants \nfrom seeking reliefs in a writ petition. He also submitted that \nassuming that some disputed questions did arise for consideration \nin the writ petition, that itself would not bar the High Court under \n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution from examining such questions of \nfact. He further submitted that in the present case, the terms of the \ncontract between the exporter and the Kazak Corporation on one \nhand and the contract of insurance between the appellants and the \nfirst respondent on the other being crystal clear, there was no \nquestion of any difficulty in interpretation of the said terms of the \ncontracts and all necessary facts required for the interpretation of \nthe said clauses of the insurance and export contracts being \nadmitted, the Appellate Bench of the High Court was in error in \ncoming to the conclusion that the writ petition involved such \ndisputed questions of facts which the High Court could not decide \nin the writ petition. He also contended that the observations of the \nHigh Court in the course of its judgment that the appellants had \nviolated the terms of the export contract or the insurance contract, \nis ex facie erroneous. He submitted that this is because of the fact \nthat the Appellate Bench did not properly appreciate the relevant \nclauses of the said contracts. He also contended that proviso (d) to \nClause (xi) of the insurance contract had no bearing whatsoever on \nthe facts of this case. Learned counsel then pointed out that the \nbasis of the repudiation as could be seen from the two letters of the \nfirst respondent was that prior permission of the said respondent \nwas not taken before making a change in the terms of the export \ncontract. According to the learned counsel, this foundation of \nrepudiation of the claim is based on a presumption that there was \nany such requirement either in law or in the contracts to have a \nprior consultation with the first respondent while making a claim to \nreceive cash consideration from the exporter. It was argued that \napart from the fact that there was no change in the terms of the \ncontract as indicated in the letters of repudiation, the assumption of \nthe first respondent that it had to be consulted while making any \nsuch demand on the Kazak Corporation is wholly baseless. \nLearned counsel pointed out from the terms of the contracts, what \nthe appellants had insured with the first respondent was not their \ngoods. On the contrary, they had actually insured the non-payment \nof consideration which under the terms of contract, was either by \nbarter or by cash. Therefore, it was not open to the first respondent \nto repudiate the appellants&#x27; claim on the ground that the mode of \nbarter payment was changed without consulting it and that the \ncontract of insurance did not cover the risk of payment in US $.  \nAccording to the learned counsel for the appellants, none of the \nterms of the contracts, be it the export contract or the insurance \ncontract, gives any room for multiple interpretation nor requires \nany evidence being led. According to said learned counsel, all that \nthe writ court had to decide was whether the appellant should \nadhere only to receive consideration by barter of goods or it is also \nentitled to demand the consideration by cash in US $ and whether \nnon-payment of such consideration is covered by the contract of \ninsurance or not which, according to learned counsel, can be \ndecided by examining the terms of the contracts without having to \ntake recourse to any external aid. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">          Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior counsel appearing for the \nfirst respondent submitted that on facts and circumstances of this \ncase, a writ petition was not maintainable nor can it be construed \nas an appropriate remedy. She pointed out that the subject matter is \na dispute arising out of a contract and is not a matter falling under \nthe purview of Administrative Law. According to her, the doctrine \nof fairness and reasonableness applies only in the exercise of \nstatutory or administrative actions of a State and not in the exercise \nof a contractual obligation and issues arising out of contractual \nmatters will have to be decided on the basis of the law of contract \nand not on the basis of the administrative law. It was her argument \nthat at the most in matters involving statutory contracts where \naction of the State involves a public duty, a writ may lie but in the \ninstant case, the contract was neither a statutory contract nor the \nduty of the first respondent under the contract had any public law \nelement involved in it. According to the learned counsel, this \ncontract was a negotiated contract and not a standard form \ncontract. She also supported the finding of the Appellate Bench of \nthe High Court that the facts involved in the case are all disputed \nfacts requiring evidence to be led, therefore, the appropriate \nremedy could only be a suit. Hence, the impugned judgment did \nnot call for any interference. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\tAs could be seen from the arguments addressed in this \nappeal and as also from the divergent views of the two courts \nbelow one of the questions that falls for our consideration is \nwhether a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of \nIndia is maintainable to enforce a contractual obligation  of the \nState or its instrumentality, by an aggrieved party.  \nIn our opinion this question is no more res integra and is  \nsettled by a large number of judicial pronouncements of this \nCourt.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"838233\" id=\"span_1\">In  <a href=\"/doc/838233/\" id=\"a_5\">K.N.

Broadly speaking, the \ncourt will examine actions of State if \nthey pertain to the public law domain \nand refrain from examining them if \nthey pertain to the private law field.  \nThe difficulty will lie in demarcating \nthe frontier between the public law \ndomain and the private law field.  It is \nimpossible to draw the line with \nprecision and we do not want to \nattempt it.  The question must be \ndecided in each case with reference to \nthe particular action, the activity in \nwhich the State or the instrumentality \nof the State is engaged when  \nperforming the action, the public law \nor private law character of the action  \nand a host of other relevant \ncircumstances.  When the  State or an \ninstrumentality of the State ventures \ninto the corporate world and \npurchases the shares  of a company, it \nassumes to itself the ordinary role of a \nshareholder, and dons the robes of a \nshareholder, with all the rights \navailable to such  a shareholder.  \nThere is no reason why the State as a \nshareholder should be expected to \nstate its reasons when it seeks to \nchange the management, by a \nresolution of the company, like any \nother shareholder.&quot; (Emphasis \nsupplied).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"730804\" id=\"span_7\">We do not think this Court <a href=\"/doc/730804/\" id=\"a_15\">in <a href=\"/doc/730804/\" id=\"a_16\">the above case</a></a> has, in any \nmanner, departed from the view expressed in the earlier \njudgments in the case cited hereinabove.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"730804\" id=\"span_8\">This Court in the case \nof <a href=\"/doc/730804/\" id=\"a_17\">Life Insurance Corporation of India</a> (Supra)  proceeded on \nthe facts of that case  and held that a relief by way of a writ \npetition may not ordinarily be an appropriate remedy.

On the contrary, the use of the words &quot;court may not \nordinarily examine it unless the action has some public law \ncharacter attached to it&quot; itself indicates that in a given case, on \nthe existence of the required factual matrix a remedy under \n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution will be available.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_9\">The learned \ncounsel then relied on another judgment of this Court in the \ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_20\">State of  U.P. &amp; Ors.

This \ndecision again, in our opinion, does not lay down an absolute \nrule that in all cases involving disputed questions of fact the \nparties should be relegated to a civil suit. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_13\">In this view of ours, \nwe are supported by a judgment of this Court in the case of \n<a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_30\">Smt.

But what \nfacts were in dispute and what were \nadmitted could only be determined \nafter an affidavit in reply was filed by \nthe State.  The High Court, however, \nproceeded to dismiss the petition in \nlimine.  The High Court is not \ndeprived of its jurisdiction  to \nentertain a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> \nmerely because in considering the \npetitioner&#x27;s right to relief questions of \nfact may fall to be determined.  In a \npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 226</a> the High \nCourt has jurisdiction  to try issues \nboth of  fact and law.  Exercise of the \njurisdiction is, it is true, discretionary, \nbut the discretion must be exercised \non sound judicial principles.  When \nthe petition raises questions of fact of \na complex nature, which  may for \ntheir determination require  oral \nevidence to be taken, and on that \naccount the High Court is of the view \nthat the dispute may not appropriately \nbe tried in a writ petition, the High \nCourt may decline to try a petition. \nRejection of a petition in limine will \nnormally be justified, where the High \nCourt is of the view that the petition is \nfrivolous or because of the nature of \nthe claim made dispute sought to be \nagitated, or that the petition against \nthe party against whom relief is \nclaimed is not maintainable or that the \ndispute raised thereby is such that it \nwould be inappropriate to try it in the \nwrit jurisdiction, or for analogous \nreasons. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">From the averments made in the \npetition filed by the appellants it is \nclear that in proof of a large number \nof allegations the appellants relied \nupon documentary evidence and the \nonly matter in respect of which \nconflict of facts may possibly arise \nrelated to the due publication of the \nnotification under Section 4 by the \nCollector. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">In the present case, in our judgment, \nthe High Court was not justified in \ndismissing the petition on the ground \nthat it will not determine disputed \nquestion of fact.

This clearly shows that in an appropriate \ncase, the writ court has the jurisdiction to entertain a writ \npetition involving disputed questions of fact and there is no \nabsolute bar for entertaining a writ petition even if the same \narises out of a contractual obligation and or involves some \ndisputed questions of fact.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1620518\" id=\"span_17\">The learned counsel for the respondent then placed \nreliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1620518/\" id=\"a_39\">VST \nIndustries Ltd. vs. VST Industries Workers&#x27; Union &amp; Anr.</a> \n[2001 (1) SCC 298].

It is to \nbe noted that VST Industries Ltd. against whom the writ \npetition was filed was not a State or an instrumentality of a \nState as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, \nhence, in the normal course, no writ could have been issued \nagainst the said industry. But it was the contention of the writ \npetitioner <a href=\"/doc/1620518/\" id=\"a_43\">in that case</a> that the said industry was obligated under \nthe concerned statute to perform certain public functions, \nfailure to do so would give rise to a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_44\">Article \n226</a> against a private body.

In the \ninstant case, as to the fact that the respondent is an \ninstrumentality of a State, there is no dispute but the question \nis:  Was first respondent discharging a public duty or a public \nfunction while repudiating the claim of the appellants arising \nout of a contract ?</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_19\">Answer to this question, in our opinion, is \nfound in the judgment of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_46\">Kumari \nShriLekha Vidyarthi &amp; Ors.  vs. State of U.P.&amp; Ors.</a> [1991 \n(1) SCC 212] wherein this Court held :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\t&quot;The impact of every State action is also on \npublic interest.

The \nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 14</a> being the duty to \nact fairly, justly and reasonably, there is \nnothing which militates against the concept \nof requiring the State always to so act, even \nin contractual matters.&quot;           \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\tIt is clear from the above observations of this Court, once \nState or an instrumentality of State is a party to the contract, it \nhas an obligation in law to act fairly, justly and reasonably \nwhich is the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of \nIndia. Therefore, if by the impugned repudiation of the claim of \nthe appellants the first respondent as an instrumentality of the \nState has acted in contravention of the above said requirement \nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 14</a> then we have no hesitation that a writ court can \nissue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions of the \nfirst respondent. In this context, we may note that though the \nfirst respondent is a company registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_50\">Companies \nAct</a>, it is wholly owned by the Government of India. The total \nsubscribed share capital of this company is 2,50,000 shares out \nof which 2,49,998 shares are held by the President of India \nwhile one each share is held by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of \nCommerce and Industry and Officer on Special Duty, Ministry \nof Commerce and Industry respectively. The objects \nenumerated in the Memorandum of Association of the first \nrespondent at Para 10 states : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;To undertake such functions as may be \nentrusted to it by Government from time to \ntime, including grant of credits and \nguarantees in foreign currency for the \npurpose of facilitating the import of raw \nmaterials and semi-finished goods for \nmanufacture or processing goods for \nexport.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\"> Para 11 of the said object reads thus : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;To act as agent of the Government, or with \nthe sanction of the Government on its own \naccount, to give the guarantees, undertake \nsuch responsibilities and discharge such \nfunctions as are considered by the \nGovernment as necessary in national \ninterest.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">It is clear from the above two objects of the company that \napart from the fact that the company is wholly a Government \nowned company it discharges the functions of the Government \nand acts as an agent of the Government even when it gives \nguarantees and it has a responsibility to discharge such \nfunctions in the national interest. In this background it will be \nfutile to contend that the actions of the first respondent \nimpugned in the writ petition do not have a touch of public \nfunction or discharge of a public duty.

The aggrieved party has \nthe right of going to the civil court for \nclaiming the amount and it is open to \nthe State to raise all possible defences \nto the claim, defences which cannot, \nin most cases, be appropriately raised \nand considered in the exercise of writ \njurisdiction.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">The judgment cannot be read as \nlaying down the law that no writ \npetition at all can be entertained \nwhere claim is made for only refund \nof money consequent upon \ndeclaration of law that levy and \ncollection of tax/cess as \nunconstitutional or without the \nauthority of law.   It is one thing to \nsay that the High Court has no power \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution \nto issue a writ of mandamus for \nmaking refund of the money illegally \ncollected.  It is yet another thing to \nsay that such power can be exercised \nsparingly depending on facts and \ncircumstances of each case.  For \ninstance, in the cases on hand where \nfacts are not in dispute, collection of \nmoney as cess was itself without the \nauthority of law; no case of undue \nenrichment was made out and the \namount of cess was paid under \nprotest; the writ petitions were filed \nwithin a reasonable time from the date \nof the declaration that the law under \nwhich tax/cess was collected was \nunconstitutional.

The High Court having regard to \nthe facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to \nentertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon itself \ncertain restrictions in the exercise of this power [See: <a href=\"/doc/1885496/\" id=\"a_59\">Whirlpool \nCorporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai &amp; Ors.</a> \n[1998 (8) SCC 1].

The claim of the contesting parties will stand \nor fall on the terms of the contracts, interpretation of which, as \nstated above, does not require any external aid.\nTherefore, we will now consider the relevant clauses of the \ncontracts in the background of the admitted facts recorded \nhereinabove. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">The contract of insurance between the appellant and the \nrespondent is primarily based on the contract between the exporter \nand the Kazak Corporation. The relevant clause in regard to \npayment for the tea exported is found in the principal contract at \nClause 6 which reads thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">&quot;The payment of delivered goods shall be \nmade by barter exchange of goods within 120 days \nfrom the date of delivery being affected by the \nSeller. Plus interest for the period of non-payment \n15% per year. The above terms will be covered by \na guarantee for payment by the Ministry of Foreign \nEconomic Relations of Kazakhstan. For Barter \nexchange of goods Buyer presently has available \nfor offer goods as per supplement N2 to the \npresent contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">This clause came to be amended on the very day when the \ncontract was signed by the exporter and the Kazak Corporation by \nan addendum, i.e., on 26.8.1993 itself. The addendum which \nformed an integral part of the original contract reads thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">&quot;In case the payment terms as per clause 6 \nof the Contract No.1-B/9-14/93 dated 26.8.1993 \nare not possible that is to say if this contract for \nbarter supply of goods cannot be finalised for any \nreason or if delivery shipment under such a \ncontract is not made within the stipulated period, \nthen the buyer shall pay the seller for delivered \ngoods in US Dollars within 120 days from the date \nof delivery being effected by the seller. This \npayment to be made through remittance by the \nbuyer of the contractual amount of delivered tea, \nplus interest 15% per year to the Bank Account of \nthe seller at Canara Bank, Janpath, New Delhi, \nIndia. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">The above payment will be guaranteed by \nthe Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of \nKazakhstan.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">If we read the original Clause 6 and the addendum \ntogether, it is crystal clear that for some reason or the other the \nparties agreed to amend original Clause 6 by the addendum \nwhich amendment brought about a significant change in the \nmode of payment of consideration. In the original Clause 6, it is \nseen that the Kazak Corporation agreed to pay for the delivered \ntea by barter of goods. This sole mode of consideration came to \nbe altered by the addendum by which parties agreed if the \npayment of consideration by barter of goods cannot be finalised \nfor any reason, the buyer that is the Kazak Corporation agreed \nto make the said payment in US $ within the stipulated period \nof 120 days of the delivery by the exporter. This addendum \nreplaced the original clause (6) and from the language of the \naddendum it is clear that the amended clause (6) became an \nintegral part of the original contract in the place of the original \nclause (6). The language of addendum clearly shows that the \npayment of consideration by barter supply of goods was no \nmore the sole mode of consideration and if for any reason \nwhatsoever such payment by barter did not materialise between \nthe parties then the payment had to be made in cash in US $. In \nour opinion, there can be no two possible interpretations as to \nthe meaning of this amending clause (addendum). This was also \nthe understanding of the Kazakhstan Corporation which is \nestablished by the fact that after the failure of barter it did pay a \npart of consideration in US$, this is also the understanding of \nthe Government of Kazakhstan which guaranteed the payment \nof such consideration which is evident from the letter of the \nMinistry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Republic of \nKazakhstan dated 18th March, 1994. In the said letter the said \nGovernment while admitting the default in payment of \nconsideration in clear terms stated:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"> &quot;But some difficulties related to \nintroduction of the national currency, execution of \nprimary internal payments between enterprises \nand budgetary deficit prevented the Kazak Party \nfrom timely repaying of the credit.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">It is clear that the first respondent insured the risk of non-\npayment arising out of the above said contract between the \nexporter and the Kazak Corporation which included the amended \nClause (6). It is also clear that the first respondent while issuing the \npolicy of insurance did know that payment of consideration by \nKazak Corporation could be by two modes (a) by barter (b) by \ncash and non payment of consideration by either mode was to be \ncovered by the said contract of insurance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\"> It is also an admitted fact that the Kazak Corporation did \noffer only some goods and not all items included in the schedule to \nthe appellants initially as a barter payment, but on evaluation made \nby the appellants, they were not acceptable to the appellants. \nTherefore, payment of consideration by barter of goods could not \nbe finalised as contemplated in amended clause (6) of the export \ncontract and in lieu of the same, the Kazak Corporation agreed to \npay in US $ and in fact did make part payment of the same in US \n$, but thereafter it defaulted in the payment of the balance amount. \nIt is also an admitted fact that the Kazakhstan Government which \nguaranteed the payment of consideration for the exported goods \nwhile admitting its liability also defaulted for its own reasons, \nconsequently the appellants could not get the full consideration for \nthe tea exported by them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_44\">\tIt is on the above fact-situation, the appellants made a \ndemand on the first respondent to compensate for the loss suffered \nby them as per their claim dated 8.9.1994. This claim of the \nappellants came to be repudiated by the first respondent as per its \nletter dated 14.12.1994. The basis of the repudiation of the claim as \ncould be seen from the said letter is as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t&quot;The buyer also did offer goods in barter \nexchange. You, however, chose without consulting \nthe Corporation not to import the goods offered by \nthe buyer may be for trade reasons. As a result, the \nbills have remained unpaid. This is clearly a trade \nloss which is not covered by the Corporation. We \nare, therefore, not in a position to entertain your \nclaim, which is hereby rejected.&quot;   \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">It is seen from this letter that the repudiation was made on \nthe ground that the appellants did not accept the goods offered by \nthe buyer without consulting the first respondent. The further \nground is that the loss suffered by the appellants was a trade loss \nwhich is not a risk covered by the Corporation. On a protest made \nagainst the said repudiation of the claim by the appellants, the first \nrespondent reiterated its stand of rejection of the claim by another \nletter of its dated 26th May, 1995, wherein it stated that as per its \nletter dated 12.10.1993, it had covered the risk of non-payment  by \nbarter only and said mode of payment was changed by the \nappellants without prior consultation with the first respondent, \ntherefore, this change amounted to a breach of an insurance \nagreement, hence, it had no liability for the loss suffered by the \nappellants. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">Having known the stand of the first respondent in regard to \nits liability under the policy and having failed in its other attempts \nto persuade the first respondent to make payments, the appellants \nfiled the writ petition before the learned Single Judge of the High \nCourt and the said learned Judge came to the conclusion that on \nfacts and circumstances of the case since the first respondent was \nadmittedly an instrumentality of State, a writ petition was \nmaintainable. It also came to the conclusion that since most of the \nfacts involved in the case were admitted and the dispute resolved \nonly around the interpretation of the agreement of insurance \nbetween the parties, the learned Judge felt that the matter could be \ndisposed of in a writ petition without driving the parties to a suit. \nHaving perused the relevant clauses the learned Single Judge held :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">&quot;There cannot be any doubt that barter \nsystem of payment was adhered to but the \naddendum clause in the contract clearly stipulates \na situation that in the event same cannot be agreed \nupon, there could be a default if Kazakhstan \nGovernment failed to pay in terms of its guarantee \nto the first respondent in US$. Default clause \nappears to be unequivocal&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">Thereafter the learned Single Judge having perused the \nvarious correspondence between the parties and noticing the fact \nthat the Kazakhstan Government also admitted its failure to \ncomply with its guarantee came to the conclusion that there was \nnothing on record to show that the appellants under the contract of \ninsurance was liable to consult the first respondent as regards its \nright to reject the payment by barter for any reason whatsoever. On \nsuch interpretation of the clauses of the contracts, the learned \nJudge felt that it was an appropriate case in which a writ should be \nissued as prayed for by the petitioner and accordingly allowed the \npetition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">In appeal, the Appellate Bench took somewhat a restricted \nview of the power of the High Court to entertain a writ petition \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and came to the \nconclusion that the petition involved disputed questions of fact, \nhence, there being an alternate remedy by way of a suit allowed the \nappeal setting aside the judgment as also the relief granted by the \ntrial court. In the course of its judgment the appellate bench also \nplaced reliance on sub-clause (d) of the proviso to clause (xi) \nfound in the contract of insurance which reads thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">&quot;PROVISOS\nPROVIDED ALWAYS THAT the \nCorporation shall not be liable for any loss:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">x x x x x\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(d) Which arises due to the failure or refusal \non the part of the buyer to accept the goods and/or \nto pay for them due to his claim that he is justified \nin withholding payment of the contract price or the \ngross invoice value of the said goods or any part \nthereof by reason of any payment, credit, set-off or \ncounter-claim and/or due to his claim that, for any \nother reason, he is excused from performing his \nobligations under the contract, unless, except \nwhere the Corporation agrees in writing to the \ncontrary, the insured has, for the amount of his \nloss, obtained by legal proceedings in a competent \ncourt of law in the country of the buyer a final \njudgment enforceable against him.&quot; (emphasis \nsupplied)\n\n\nAccording to the Appellate Bench as per this proviso in \nthe insurance contract, the first respondent was not liable for \nany loss which arises due to the failure or refusal on the part of \nthe appellants to accept goods offered by the buyer. Though this \ninterpretation of the said proviso to the insurance clause made \nby the Appellate Bench is not a conclusive finding, we think it \nappropriate to deal with this view expressed by the Appellate \nBench since we intend to dispose of this appeal on merits. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">Having examined the said sub-clause in the proviso of the \ninsurance policy, in our opinion, the reliance placed by the \nappellate bench of the High Court on this clause is wholly \nmisplaced. The proviso especially the one in sub-clause (d) \ndeals with the risks arising due to the failure or refusal on the \npart of the buyer to accept the goods and/or to pay for them due \nto his claim that he is justified in withholding payment of the \ncontract price or the gross invoice value of the said goods for \nthe reason mentioned therein. This clause pertains to the \ndefence that may be put forth by the buyer (in this case the \nKazak Corporation) as to its refusal to pay the consideration on \nthe grounds enumerated in the said sub-clause. This is not a \nclause which indemnifies the insurance company from its \nliability to cover risk when the importer fails to pay for the \nconsideration for the goods received by it on grounds of its \nfinancial inability. Therefore the reliance placed by the High \nCourt on this sub-clause to the proviso in the insurance \ncontract, as stated above, is misplaced.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">The learned counsel appearing for the appellants in this \nappeal contended that the one and the only stand taken by the \nappellants in their two letters of repudiation is that the \nappellants have changed the mode of receipt of consideration \nwithout consulting the first respondent which ground according \nto the learned counsel is not one of the conditions of the \ninsurance contract. He further submitted that an imposition of a \ncondition of that nature requiring a prior consultation would be \nbeyond the terms of the insurance contract, therefore, \nimpermissible. While learned counsel appearing for the first \nrespondent Corporation contended that the ground of \nrepudiation is not so much the lack of prior consultation but, \naccording to learned counsel, is that the first respondent was not \nliable to pay for the loss suffered by the exporter by agreeing to \naccept the consideration in cash because that mode of \nconsideration was not covered by the risk insured by the \nrespondent. According to the learned counsel, one and the only \nmode of payment of consideration covered by the said \nrespondent is by barter of goods. Therefore, even though in the \nletters of repudiation the prior consultation before change in the \nmode of consideration is pointed out as one of the grounds, the \nsame is not the primary ground.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">From the terms of the contract, we have noticed in Clause \n(6) as amended by the addendum, consideration by way of \nbarter of goods is not the sole consideration. The said clause \ncontemplates alternate modes of payment of consideration one \nof them being by barter of goods and the other by cash payment \nin US $. The terms of the insurance contract which was agreed \nbetween the parties were after the terms of the contract between \nthe exporter and the importer were executed which included the \naddendum, therefore, without hesitation we must proceed on \nthe basis that the first respondent issued the insurance policy \nknowing very well that there was more than one mode of \npayment of consideration and it had insured failure of all the \nmodes of payment of consideration. From the correspondence \nas well as from the terms of the policy, it is noticed that \nexistence of only two conditions have been made as a condition \nprecedent for making the first respondent Corporation liable to \npay for the insured risk, that is, (i) there should be a default on \nthe part of the Kazak Corporation to pay for the goods received; \nand (ii) there should be a failure on the part of the Kazakhstan \nGovernment to fulfil their guarantee. This is clear from the \nterms of the insurance contract read with the letter of the first \nrespondent dated 8th September, 1993 wherein at Clause 3A, it \nis stated : &quot;Our liability will arise only after default has been \nestablished on the guarantee of the Ministry.&quot; From the above, \nit is clear both the grounds as put forth by the learned counsel \nfor the respondent before us as well as in the two letters of \nrepudiation issued by the first respondent are unsustainable. In \nour opinion, the first respondent insured the export risk of the \nappellants in regard to the non payment of the consideration for \nthe tea exported whether it arose from the non fulfillment of the \nbarter clause or for the non fulfillment of the cash payment \nclause. The argument advanced on behalf of the respondent that \nthe appellants refused to accept the barter by goods offered by \nthe first respondent which amounted to a default under the \ncontract on the part of the appellants has no legs to stand in \nview of the clear language of the amended Clause 6 of the \nagreement which as noted above states that the obligation of the \nbuyer, namely, Kazak Corporation to pay for the goods \nreceived by it in US $ arises when payment by barter fails for \n&quot;any reason whatever&quot;. The use of the words &quot;any reason \nwhatever&quot; in the said amended clause includes the reasons of \nrefusal by the appellants to accept the goods offered in barter. \nOn the face of the said language of amended clause, there could \nbe no room for two opinions at all in regard to the liability of \nthe first respondent to pay for the loss suffered by the appellants \neven in cases where payment by barter fails at the instance of \nthe appellant. The learned counsel for the respondent contended \nfor a correct interpretation of this amended clause and the other \nclauses of the contracts i.e. the contract of export and the \ncontract of insurance between the parties there is need for oral \nevidence being led without which a proper interpretation of this \nclause is not possible, therefore, it is fit case in which the \nappellants should be directed to approach the Civil Court to \nestablish its claim. We find no force in this argument. We have \ncome to the conclusion that the amended Clause 6 of the \nagreement between the exporter and the importer on the face of \nit does not give room for a second or another construction than \nthe one already accepted by us. We have also noted that \nreliance placed on sub-clause (d) of the proviso to the insurance \ncontract by the Appellate Bench is also misplaced which is \nclear from the language of the said clause itself. Therefore, in \nour opinion, it does not require any external aid much less any \noral evidence to interpret the above clause. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_23\">Merely because the \nfirst respondent wants to dispute this fact, in our opinion, it \ndoes not become a disputed fact. If such objection as to \ndisputed questions or interpretations are raised in a writ \npetition, in our opinion, the courts can very well go into the \nsame and decide that objection if facts permit the same as in \nthis case. We have already noted the decisions of this court \nwhich in clear terms have laid down that mere existence of \ndisputed questions of fact ipso facto does not prevent a writ \ncourt from determining the disputed questions of fact. (See: \n<a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_63\">Gunwant Kaur</a> (supra)).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_24\">On the basis of the above conclusion of ours, the question \nstill remains why should we grant the reliefs sought for by the \nappellant in a writ petition when a suitable efficacious alternate \nremedy is available by way of a suit. The answer to this \nquestion in our opinion, lies squarely in the decision of this \nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_64\">ShriLekha Vidyarthi</a> (supra) wherein this \ncourt held :</span>       \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;The requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 14</a> should \nextend even in the sphere of contractual \nmatters for regulating the conduct of the \nState activity. Applicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 14</a> to \nall executive actions of the State being \nsettled and for the same reason its \napplicability at the threshold to the making \nof a contract in exercise of the executive \npower being beyond dispute, the State \ncannot thereafter cast off its personality and \nexercise unbridled power unfettered by the \nrequirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 14</a> in the sphere of \ncontractual matters and claim to be governed \ntherein only by private law principles \napplicable to private individuals whose \nrights flow only from the terms of the \ncontract without anything more. The \npersonality of the State, requiring regulation \nof its conduct in all spheres by requirement \nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 14</a>, does not undergo such a \nradical change after the making of a contract \nmerely because some contractual rights \naccrue to the other party in addition. It is not \nas if the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 14</a> and \ncontractual obligations are alien concepts, \nwhich cannot co-exist. The Constitution \ndoes not envisage or permit unfairness or \nunreasonableness in State actions in any \nsphere of its activity contrary to the \nprofessed ideals in the Preamble. Therefore, \ntotal exclusion of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 14 -</a> non-\narbitrariness which is basic to rule of law -  \nfrom State actions in contractual field is not \njustified. This is more so when the modern \ntrend is also to examine the \nunreasonableness of a term in such contracts \nwhere the bargaining power is  unequal so \nthat these are not negotiated contracts but \nstandard form contracts between unequals. x \nx x\n\nUnlike the private parties the State \nwhile exercising its powers and discharging \nits functions, acts indubitably, as is expected \nof it, for public good and in public interest. \nThe impact of every State action is also on \npublic interest. It is really the nature of its \npersonality as State which is significant and \nmust characterize all its actions, in whatever \nfield, and not the nature of function, \ncontractual or otherwise, which is decisive \nof the nature of scrutiny permitted for \nexamining the validity of its act. The \nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 14</a> being the duty to \nact fairly, justly and reasonably, there is \nnothing which militates against the concept \nof requiring the State always to so act, even \nin contractual matters. This factor alone is \nsufficient to import at least the minimal \nrequirements of public law obligations and \nimpress with this character the contracts \nmade by the State or its instrumentality. It is \na different matter that the scope of judicial \nreview in respect of disputes falling within \nthe domain of contractual obligations may \nbe more limited and in doubtful cases the \nparties may be relegated to adjudication of \ntheir rights by resort to remedies provided \nfor adjudication of purely contractual \ndisputes. However, to the extent, challenge \nis made on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_72\">Article \n14</a> by alleging that the impugned act is \narbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact \nthat the dispute also falls within the domain \nof contractual obligations would not relieve \nthe State of its obligation to comply with the \nbasic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 14.</a> To this \nextent, the obligation is of a public character \ninvariably in every case irrespective of there \nbeing any other right or obligation in \naddition thereto. An additional contractual \nobligation cannot divest the claimant of the \nguarantee under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 14</a> of non-\narbitrariness at the hands of the State in any \nof its actions. x x x &quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">\tFrom the above, it is clear that when an instrumentality \nof the State acts contrary to public good and public interest, \nunfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, in its contractual, \nconstitutional or statutory obligations, it really acts contrary to \nthe constitutional guarantee found in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 14</a> of the \nConstitution. Thus if we apply the above principle of \napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 14</a> to the facts of this case, then we \nnotice that the first respondent being an instrumentality of State \nand a monopoly body had to be approached by the appellants \nby compulsion to cover its export risk. The policy of insurance \ncovering the risk of the appellants was issued by the first \nrespondent after seeking all required information and after \nreceiving huge sums of money as premium exceeding Rs.16 \nlacs. On facts we have found that the terms of the policy does \nnot give room to any ambiguity as to the risk covered by the \nfirst respondent. We are also of the considered opinion that the \nliability of the first respondent under the policy arose when the \ndefault of the exporter occurred and thereafter when \nKazakhstan Government failed to fulfil its guarantee. There is \nno allegation that the contracts in question were obtained either \nby fraud or by misrepresentation. In such factual situation, we \nare of the opinion, the facts of this case do not and should not \ninhibit the High Court or this Court from granting the relief \nsought for by the petitioner.    \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">Apart from the above reasons given by us to interfere with \nthe judgment of the Appellate Bench of the High Court, we have \none other good reason - why we should not drive the appellants to \na suit. The claim of the appellants was rejected by the respondent \nin the year 1994. The respondent challenged the basis of rejection \nby way of a writ petition in the year 1996. The objection as to the \nmaintainability of the petition was rejected by the High Court by \nits judgment dated 15.5.1997. We are now in the end of year 2003. \nWe at this distance of time and stage of litigation, do not think it \nproper to relegate the parties to a suit. To direct the appellants to \napproach a civil court at this stage would be doing injustice to the \nappellants. In this view of ours, we are supported by a number of \ndecisions of this court like in Shambhu Prasad Agarwal &amp; Ors. vs. \nBhola Ram Agarwal (2000 9 SCC 714), wherein this Court though \nnoticed the fact that the appellants had an alternate remedy for \nissuance of a letter of administration it refused to dismiss the \nappeal on the grounds -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;Since considerable time has elapsed the \ninterest of justice demands that the proceeding \nshould come to an end as early as possible and that \nthe appeal should not be dismissed merely on \nhighly technical ground&quot;. \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132229\" id=\"span_25\">In <a href=\"/doc/132229/\" id=\"a_77\">Dr.Bal Krishna Agarwal vs. State of U.P. &amp; Ors.</a> (1995 \n(1) SCC 614) this Court held :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">&quot;Having regard to the aforesaid facts and \ncircumstances, we are of the view that the High \nCourt was not right in dismissing the writ petition \nof the appellant on the ground of availability of an \nalternate remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1106042/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 68</a> of the Act \nespecially when the writ petition that was filed in \n1988 had already been admitted and was pending \nin the High Court for the past more than 5 years. \nSince the question that is raised involves a pure \nquestion of law and even if the matter is referred to \nthe Chancellor under <a href=\"/doc/1106042/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 68</a> of the Act it is \nbound to be agitated in the court by the party \naggrieved by the order of the Chancellor, we are of \nthe view that this was not a case where the High \nCourt should have non-suited, the appellant  on the \nground of availability of an alternative remedy. \nWe, therefore, propose to go into the merits of the \nquestion regarding inter se seniority of the \nappellant and Respondents 4 and 5.
