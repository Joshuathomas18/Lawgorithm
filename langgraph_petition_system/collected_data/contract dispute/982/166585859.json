As per pleading available on record, it is evident that\n\nthe respondent-contractor has accepted the work order\n\nand started the contractual work but the work having not\n\nbeen concluded as per the time schedule, and there was\n\nno improvement in the rate of progress/execution of\n\nworks   by    the   respondent,    the   petitioner-MECON\n\nterminated the work order vide letter dated 17.12.2021.\n\nThereafter, the petitioner got the balance work under the\n\nwork order executed by a third entity at a total basic\n\nprice of Rs. 3,89,68,536/- as against the ‗Initial Total\n\nContract Price&#x27; of Rs. 3,07,80,708/- plus overhead.\n\nConsequently, the petitioner vide letter dated 07.04.2022\n\nraised its claim upon the respondent to the tune of\n\nRs.81,87,828/- but the respondent did not pay it till\n\ndate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_69\">55. It is submitted that thereafter as per provisions of\n\nClause 36.2.1, the petitioner vide letter dated 13.09.2022\n\nrequested the respondent for conciliation of the disputes\n\nbut the respondent failed to take any action, therefore,\n\nthe respondent issued notice invoking arbitration clause\n\n36.2.1 vide letter dated 16.06.2023 proposing panel of\n\nthree names from which the respondent was requested to\n\nnominate for appointment of sole arbitrator for resolution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                            20</span>\n of disputes between the parties but the respondent did\n\nnot take any steps.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">56.

The respondent has raised the issue that the\n\ncondition stipulated in the work order cannot be\n\nconstrued to be concluded contract, as such the\n\narbitration clause even if it is available therein as Clause\n\nNo. 36.0, cannot maintain the present application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 in absence of any formal contract between the\n\nparties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">58.

This Court needs to refer herein so far merit of the\n\ncase is concerned the same is not required to be taken\n\ninto consideration at this stage by this Court reason\n\nbeing that this Court is exercising the power conferred\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 wherein the\n\njurisdiction lies to the Court to appoint arbitrator only\n\nand any other issues on merit is to be considered in\n\ncourse of adjudication by the arbitrator, if appointed.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                           21</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\"> 60.

This Court, in order to answer the issue, needs to\n\nagain go the factual aspect of the instant case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_77\">63. The petitioner-MECON, for executing the work,\n\ninvited bids for execution of works pertaining to ‗Civil\n\nWorks for installation of 4th Stove in Blast Furnace No. 4\n\nof SAIL, Durgapur Steel Plant, Durgapur&#x27;, whereupon the\n\nrespondent-contractor      offered   his   candidature   and\n\nparticipated in the tender process. The respondent-\n\ncontractor, after going through the tender process\n\nemerged as L-1 tenderer, and as such was declared\n\nsuccessful. Accordingly work order being Work Order No.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                             22</span>\n 11.51.027U/Civil     Works/Pkg.

The said work order has been accepted by the\n\nrespondent since the respondent has commenced the\n\nwork in pursuance to the said work order. The said work\n\norder     contains   certain        conditions     including     the\n\narbitration clause at Clause No. 36 i.e., the dispute\n\nredressal mechanism. Clause 36.2 of the work order\n\ncontains specific provision that in case of any dispute\n\nbetween the parties, the same shall be referred to for\n\narbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">65. Further, Clause 36.2.1 of the work order speaks that\n\nany disputes, differences, whatsoever, arising between\n\nthe parties shall be settled between parties amicably. If,\n\nhowever, the parties are not able to resolve their\n\ndisputes/differences amicably as aforesaid, the said\n\ndisputes/differences shall be settled by Arbitration in\n\naccordance with the Rules of Arbitration and the award\n\nmade in pursuance thereof shall be binding on the\n\nparties. However, conciliation shall be resorted to prior to\n\ninvoking Arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">66. Fact about commencement of work has not been\n\ndisputed by the respondent, since there is no averment to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               23</span>\n that effect that work has not been commenced by the\n\nrespondent-contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">67. The question, therefore, would be that in such\n\ncircumstances where the work order issued by the\n\npetitioner has not been disputed rather it is being\n\nadmitted as would appear from the conduct of the\n\nrespondent-contractor that the work has commenced in\n\npursuance to the said work order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">68. The moment the respondent has accepted the work\n\norder by commencement of the work in pursuance to the\n\nsaid work order dated 04.10.2021, according to the\n\nconsidered view of this Court it is not available for the\n\nrespondent to take the ground that the same cannot be\n\ntreated in the nature of concluded contract reason being\n\nthat the document if being accepted it is to be accepted\n\nby the party in entirety and not in piecemeal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1660026\" id=\"span_23\">69.

It is evident from <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 7</a> of the Act, 1996 wherein\n\ncertain criteria have been given considering the same to\n\nbe an agreement within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/53375/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 2(b)</a> of the\n\nAct, 1996. The ‗Arbitration Agreement&#x27; has been defined\n\nunder Chapter II of Section 7, which means an agreement\n\nby the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain\n\ndisputes which have arisen or which may arise between\n\nthem in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether\n\ncontractual or not; meaning the agreement will be said to\n\nbe an agreement which if is in respect of legal\n\nrelationship, whether contractual or not.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">73. Sub-section (2) of Section 7 thereof stipulated that\n\nan arbitration agreement may be in the form of an\n\narbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                26</span>\n separate agreement. Sub-Section (3) thereof provides that\n\nan arbitration agreement shall be in writing. Sub-section\n\n(4) thereof provides that an arbitration agreement is in\n\nwriting if it is contained in-- (a) a document signed by the\n\nparties; (b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or\n\nother    means       of        telecommunication    [including\n\ncommunication through electronic means] which provide\n\na record of the agreement; or (c) an exchange of\n\nstatements of claim and defence in which the existence of\n\nthe agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by\n\nthe other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">74. Sub-Section (5) of Section 7 stipulates that the\n\nreference in a contract to a document containing an\n\narbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if\n\nthe contract is in writing and the reference is such as to\n\nmake that arbitration clause part of the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">75. It is evident from perusal of Section 7 sub-<a href=\"/doc/1233565/\" id=\"a_21\">section\n\n4(b)</a> along with the word ―legal relationship‖ as provided\n\nunder Section 7(1) that the legal relationship also\n\nestablishes by way of exchange of letters, telex, telegrams\n\nor   other   means        of    telecommunication   [including\n\ncommunication through electronic means] which provide\n\na record of the agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">76. This Court, therefore, requires to consider what is\n\nthe meaning of word ‗legal relationship&#x27;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                27</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\"> 77. For that, this Court is again delving into the factual\n\naspect of the present case, from which it would be\n\nevident that the work order is issued on the basis of the\n\ndecision taken by the tender committee which was\n\nconstituted in pursuance to the ‗Notice Inviting Tender&#x27;,\n\nin which the respondent was declared successful.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_92\">78. It is the respondent who has offered its candidature\n\nfor consideration so that the work order be allotted to\n\nhim, if he is found to be eligible in terms of the condition\n\nof NIT. The respondent after going through the tender\n\nprocess   has emerged     L-1    and   has been declared\n\nsuccessful and thereafter the decision has been taken by\n\nissuing the work order in favour of respondent. The\n\nissuance of the work order, after being successful in the\n\ntender process, will be said to have creation of legal\n\nrelationship   between     the    petitioner-MECON      and\n\nrespondent-contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">79. This Court is coming to such conclusion, that is of\n\nrelationship   between     the    petitioner-MECON      and\n\nrespondent-contractor is relationship, for the reason that\n\nprocess of entering into the relationship will be legal one\n\nwhen the work order has been issued in favour of the\n\nrespondent after conclusion of process of tender and\n\nthereafter the respondent while accepting the terms and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                           28</span>\n conditions of the work order has commenced the\n\nproposed work also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">80. The      matter    would     have       been       different,   if   the\n\nrespondent would not have commenced the work in\n\npursuance to the work order and at the outright work\n\norder was not accepted by the respondent but that is not\n\nthe fact herein and if that would have been the situation\n\nthen it could have been understood that no legal\n\nrelationship has ever existed between the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">81. But      herein    the     fact    is     otherwise       since      the\n\nrespondents have accepted the work order meaning\n\nthereby the work order has been accepted by the\n\nrespondent in entirety including the terms and conditions\n\nstipulated therein, in particular clause 36.0 which is the\n\nArbitration Clause mentioned in the work order.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">82. Section     7     sub-<a href=\"/doc/1233565/\" id=\"a_22\">section      4(b)</a>     stipulates        that   an\n\narbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in\n\nexchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of\n\ntelecommunication [including communication through\n\nelectronic    means]     which        provide      a     record     of   the\n\nagreement if the same will be read along with the\n\ndefinition of ‗legal relationship, the ground which has\n\nbeen taken on behalf of respondent that the condition\n\nstipulated having not been signed by the respondent will\n\nnot be said to be concluded contract, is having no force,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                 29</span>\n reason being that in case of exchange of letters the\n\nbilateral relationship might be there but in a case of\n\ntelex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication,\n\nwhich provide the record of agreement, there is no\n\nrequirement of signature of the other side, exactly the\n\ncase herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_97\">83. The moment the work order has been accepted by\n\ncommencement of work by the respondent it is not\n\navailable for the respondent to take the ground there is\n\nno signature on the work order, hence, the agreement\n\ncannot be said to be concluded agreement.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">84. The      moment      the     respondent        has   offered   its\n\ncandidature for allotment of work order in pursuance to\n\nNotice     Inviting    Tender    and    in   furtherance     thereto\n\ndecision     has      been   taken     on    his    application    on\n\nconsideration by the            petitioner after declaring the\n\nrespondent to be successful bidder and work order has\n\nbeen issued thereafter then the same will in the same\n\ntransaction and it will be the contract in between the\n\npetitioner and the respondent by virtue of issuance of\n\nwork order incorporating certain condition including\n\nClause No. 36 of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"171214938\" id=\"span_31\">85. The issue fell for consideration before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/171214938/\" id=\"a_23\">Govind Rubber Limited Vs.\n\nLouis    Drefus       Commodities       Asia       Private   Limited</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                 30</span>\n [(2015) 13 SCC 477], wherein it has been held that a\n\ncommercial agreement has to be construed according to\n\nsense and meaning as collected in a first place from the\n\nterms used and understood in the plain, ordinary and\n\npopular sense in order to effectuate the immediate\n\nintention of the parties. An agreement even if not signed\n\nby the parties can be spelt out from correspondence\n\nexchanged between the parties. However, it is the duty of\n\nthe Court to construe correspondence with a view to\n\narrive at the conclusion whether there was any meeting\n\nof mind between the parties which could create a binding\n\ncontract between them and further it has been held that\n\nin order to constitute an agreement, it need not be signed\n\nby all the parties. For ready reference, the relevant\n\nparagraphs of the judgment are quoted as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">    &quot;12. There may not be any dispute with regard to the settled\n    proposition of law that an agreement even if not signed by\n    the   parties   can    be   spelt   out   from   correspondence\n    exchanged between the parties. However, it is the duty of\n    the court to construe correspondence with a view to\n    arrive at the conclusion whether there was any meeting\n    of mind between the parties which could create a binding\n    contract between them. It is necessary for the court to find\n    out from the correspondence as to whether the parties were ad\n    idem to the terms of contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">    13. It is equally well settled that while construing an arbitration\n    agreement or arbitration clause, the courts have to adopt a\n    pragmatic and not a technical approach. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979603\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/1979603/\" id=\"a_24\">Rukmanibai\n    Gupta v.

Arbitration agreement is not required to be in any\n      particular form. What is required to be ascertained is\n      whether the parties have agreed that if disputes arise\n      between them in respect of the subject-matter of contract\n      such dispute shall be referred to arbitration, then such\n      an    arrangement       would    spell    out      an    arbitration\n      agreement.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">14. So far as the first contention made by the learned\ncounsel for the appellant that since the appellant did not\nsign the agreement, it cannot be said to be a party to the\nagreement, we would like to refer <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 7</a> of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      7.Arbitration         agreement.--(1)          In        this     Part,\n      „arbitration agreement‟ means an agreement by the\n      parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes\n      which have arisen or which may arise between them in\n      respect      of   a   defined   legal    relationship,         whether\n      contractual or not.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">      (2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an\n      arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a\n      separate agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">      (3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.\n      (4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained\n      in--\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">      (a) a document signed by the parties;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">      (b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means\n      of telecommunication which provide a record of the\n      agreement; or\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_105\">      (c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in\n      which the existence of the agreement is alleged by one\n      party and not denied by the other.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">      (5) The reference in a contract to a document containing\n      an    arbitration      clause   constitutes        an     arbitration\n      agreement if the contract is in writing and the reference\n      is such as to make that arbitration clause part of the\n      contract.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                               32</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">    15. A perusal of the aforesaid provisions would show that in\n   order to constitute an arbitration agreement, it need not be\n   signed by all the parties. <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 7(3)</a> of the Act provides that\n   the arbitration agreement shall be in writing, which is a\n   mandatory requirement. Section 7(4) states that the arbitration\n   agreement shall be in writing, if it is a document signed by all\n   the parties. But a perusal of clauses (b) and (c) of Section 7(4)\n   would show that a written document which may not be signed\n   by the parties even then it can be arbitration agreement. Section\n   7(4)(b) provides that an arbitration agreement can be culled out\n   from an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of\n   telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">   16. On reading the provisions it can safely be concluded\n   that an arbitration agreement even though in writing\n   need not be signed by the parties if the record of\n   agreement is provided by exchange of letters, telex,\n   telegrams or other means of telecommunication. Section\n   7(4)(c)   provides    that    there   can     be   an   arbitration\n   agreement in the exchange of statements of claims and\n   defence in which the existence of the agreement is\n   alleged by one party and not denied by the other. If it can\n   be prima facie shown that the parties are at ad idem, then the\n   mere fact of one party not signing the agreement cannot absolve\n   him from the liability under the agreement. In the present day\n   of e-commerce, in cases of internet purchases, tele purchases,\n   ticket booking on internet and in standard forms of contract,\n   terms and conditions are agreed upon. In such agreements, if\n   the identity of the parties is established, and there is a record\n   of agreement it becomes an arbitration agreement if there is an\n   arbitration clause showing ad idem between the parties.\n   Therefore, signature is not a formal requirement under Section\n   7(4)(b) or 7(4)(c) or under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"171214938\" id=\"span_36\">86. Therefore, this Court, taking into consideration the\n\ndiscussion made hereinabove and law <a href=\"/doc/1979603/\" id=\"a_28\">laid down by</a>\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/171214938/\" id=\"a_29\">Govind Rubber\n\nLimited Vs.

The issue formulated by this Court on the basis of\n\npleading made by the parties is answered against the\n\nrespondent and it is hereby held that the work order\n\nissued by the petitioner in favour of the respondent, who\n\nhad already commenced the proposed work based upon\n\nthe said work order, is concluded contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">88. This Court, after having discussed the issue is in\n\ndetail, as hereinabove, is of the view that it is a case\n\nwhere the application filed under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the\n\nAct, 1996 is held to be maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">89. Now,    the    second   question    which    arises   for\n\nconsideration is as to:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">    Whether the mechanism, as provided under Clause 36\n\n    of the work order has properly been followed before\n\n    taking recourse of provision of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act,\n\n    1996 or not?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">90.

If,\n\nhowever, the MECON and the Contractor are not able to\n\nresolve their disputes / differences amicably as aforesaid,\n\nthe said disputes / differences shall be settled by\n\nArbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration\n\nand the award made in pursuance thereof shall be\n\nbinding on the parties.

Clause 36.2 of the work order is specific that in case\n\nof any dispute between the parties, the same shall be\n\nreferred to for arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">92. This Court in the backdrop of aforesaid clause has\n\nagain delve into the factual aspect and found therefrom\n\nthat at clause 4.0, which speaks about completion\n\nschedule/time,     wherein       it    has   specifically   been\n\nmentioned that Completion Schedule/ Time is one of the\n\nmost important aspects of the work order and further the\n\nentire works as detailed in the Technical Specification\n\nshall be completed within 08 (eight) months from the date\n\nof work order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">93. But, as per pleading made in the writ petition, when\n\nthe respondent-contractor failed to expedite the progress\n\nof the work in question and did not meet the targets, as\n\nagreed upon between the parties, sent several reminder\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                               35</span>\n letters and vide letter dated 18.11.2021 as also ‗Notice of\n\nNegligence&#x27;, as would be evident from Annexure 8 to the\n\ninstant application. Consequently, a joint meeting was\n\nalso convened on 26.11.2021 whereby revised dates for\n\nexecution of works were agreed upon by the parties, as\n\nwould be evident from minutes                of meeting dated\n\n26.11.2021, annexed a Annexure 10 to the instant\n\napplication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">94. It is the case of the petitioner that even thereafter,\n\nthe respondent did not adhere to the time schedule and\n\nhonor the commitment given by the respondent, as such\n\nseveral request/warning letters were given for completion\n\nof work, annexed as Annexure 12 to the application.\n\nThereafter, it is stated that inspection was done by the\n\npetitioner of the site and it was found that no work is\n\nbeing carried out by the respondent, as such the\n\npetitioner     terminated      the   work    order,     which      was\n\ncommunicated        to   the     respondent      vide     letter    of\n\ntermination order dated 17.12.2021 [Annexure 17 to the\n\ninstant application] and got the balance work executed by\n\na third entity third entity at a total basic price of Rs.\n\n3,89,68,536 as against the ‗Initial Total Contract Price&#x27; of\n\nRs. 3,07,80,708/- plus overhead.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">95. Consequently,        the    petitioner   vide     letter    dated\n\n07.04.2022 raised its claim upon the respondent to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                36</span>\n tune    of   Rs.81,87,828/-    and    a    claim    letter   dated\n\n07.04.2022 has been sent by the petitioner to the\n\nrespondent, as would be evident from Annexure 19 to the\n\ninstant application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">96. It appears that the petitioner vide letter dated\n\n13.09.2022 requested the respondent contractor for\n\nconciliation of the disputes that has accrued between the\n\nparties as per Clause 36.2.1 of the work order but the\n\nrespondent did not act in furtherance of the notice for\n\nconciliation issued under Clause 36.2.1 of the work order\n\nand no communication has been received by the\n\nrespondent in this regard also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">97.
