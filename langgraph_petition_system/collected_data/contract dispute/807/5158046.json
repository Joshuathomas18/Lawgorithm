Learned Senior Counsel submits that it is the case of the\nRespondent in OMP (I) (COMM) 341 and 342/2019 (for the Ralla\nProject) that parties also executed Coordination Agreements qua the\nProjects, the clauses of which allow the Respondent to invoke the BGs\nissued under the respective Orders, for their alleged claims under other\nAgreements executed with other Companies mentioned in Schedule 1 of\nthe Coordination Agreements.         It is argued that this stand of the\nrespondent is misconceived as the only other Company which was a party\nto the said Coordination Agreements, in addition to the Petitioner and the\nRespondent, was Suzlon Gujarat Wind Park Ltd. (SGWPL).               It is also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.

None of the other five petitions herein contain similar\nCoordination Agreements, which entitle the Respondent to invoke the\nBGs for other Agreements.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">17.    Learned Senior Counsel submits that it came as a shock to the\nPetitioner when the Respondent invoked the BGs under the present\npetitions involving a sum of little over Rs.100 Crores. Perusal of the BGs\nin each case shows that they were issued under the respective Orders, for\nsupply of WTGs and not under any other Agreements.          Learned Senior\nCounsel also contends that this clearly is a fraudulent invocation of the\nBGs, which serves to vitiate the BGs and also causes irretrievable loss to\nthe Petitioner.       The Petitioner is undergoing a Corporate Debt\nRestructuring Process (CDRP) and despite having knowledge of the\nsame, Respondent chose to invoke the BGs. It is for this reason that the\nCourt had, at the initial stage, stayed the invocation in all the petitions.\nRespondent took more than 2 and a half months to file the replies, as in\nthe meantime, they were manufacturing claims to make out a case that\nmoney was due from the Petitioner. As an illustration, the first alleged\nclaim in OMP (I)(COMM) 341/2019 is towards shortfall in resource\navailability. This is an amount sought by the Respondent from SGSL and\nnot the Petitioner and that too, under a separate O&amp;M Agreement\nexecuted between SGCL and the Respondent. Even the letters raising the\nclaim were addressed to SGCL and not even copied to the Petitioner.\nThis is a clear case of egregious fraud on the part of the Respondent to\ninvoke the BGs and encash them.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.

Sumac International Ltd.</a> [(1997) 1 SCC\n              568] The general principle which has been <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_13\">laid down by</a>\n              this Court has been summarised in the case of U.P. State\n              Sugar Corpn. [(1997) 1 SCC 568] as follows: (SCC p.\n              574, para 12) &quot;The law relating to invocation of such\n              bank guarantees is by now well settled. When in the\n              course of commercial dealings an unconditional bank\n              guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled\n              to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof\n              irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving\n              such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms\n              irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The\n              very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would\n              otherwise be defeated. The courts should, therefore, be\n              slow in granting an injunction to restrain the realization\n              of such a bank guarantee. The courts have carved out\n              only two exceptions. A fraud in connection with such a\n              bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such\n              a bank guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which\n              the beneficiary seeks to take the advantage, he can be\n              restrained from doing so. The second exception relates to\n              cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional\n              bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or\n              injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most\n              cases payment of money under such a bank guarantee\n              would adversely affect the bank and its customer at\n              whose instance the guarantee is given, the harm or\n              injustice contemplated under this head must be of such an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.                                    Page 23 of 39</span>\n               exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override\n              the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such\n              an injunction on commercial dealings in the country.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">              Dealing with the question of fraud it has been held that\n              fraud has to be an established fraud. The following\n              observations of Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in Bolivinter\n              Oil SA v. Chase Manhattan Bank [(1984) 1 All ER 351,\n              CA] are apposite:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">              &quot;The wholly exceptional case where an injunction may\n              be granted is where it is proved that the bank knows that\n              any demand for payment already made or which may\n              thereafter be made will clearly be fraudulent. But the\n              evidence must be clear, both as to the fact of fraud and as\n              to the bank&#x27;s knowledge. It would certainly not normally\n              be sufficient that this rests on the uncorroborated\n              statement of the customer, for irreparable damage can be\n              done to a bank&#x27;s credit in the relatively brief time which\n              must elapse between the granting of such an injunction\n              and an application by the bank to have it discharged.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">           34. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_26\">In <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_14\">Vinitec Electronics Private Ltd. v.

This Court in more than one decision took the view\n              that fraud, if any, must be of an egregious nature as to\n              vitiate the underlying transaction. We have meticulously\n              examined the pleadings in the present case in which no\n              factual foundation is laid in support of the allegation of\n              fraud. There is not even a proper allegation of any fraud\n              as such and in fact the whole case of the appellant\n              centres around the allegation with regard to the alleged\n              breach of contract by the respondent. The plea of fraud in\n              the appellant&#x27;s own words is to the following effect:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">              &quot;That despite the respondent HCL being in default of not\n              making payment as stipulated in the bank guarantee, in\n              perpetration of abject dishonesty and fraud, the\n              respondent HCL fraudulently invoked the bank guarantee\n              furnished by the applicant and sought remittance of the\n              sums under the conditional bank guarantee from Oriental\n              Bank of Commerce vide letter of invocation dated 16-12-\n              2003.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">              26. In our considered opinion such vague and indefinite\n              allegations made do not satisfy the requirement in law\n              constituting any fraud much less the fraud of an\n              egregious nature as to vitiate the entire transaction.

The guarantee is unconditional,\n              no doubt, the performance guarantee is against the\n              breach by the lead promoter viz. the first respondent.

We are afraid that the\n              contention cannot be appreciated. The bank guarantee is\n              a separate contract and is not qualified by the contract\n              on performance of the obligations. No doubt, in terms of\n              the bank guarantee also, the invocation is only against a\n              breach of the conditions in the LoI. But between the\n              appellant and the Bank, it has been stipulated that the\n              decision of the appellant as to the breach shall be\n              absolute and binding on the Bank.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">              12.

This Rule is subject to only two\nexceptions and which are : (a). egregious fraud which vitiates the entire\nunderlying transactions and of which the Bank has notice; or (b).\nirretrievable injury of an exceptional circumstance, where it is impossible\nfor the Guarantor to reimburse itself, if it ultimately succeeds in final\nadjudication of the disputes.     The Courts in exceptional circumstances\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.

The question therefore that this Court needs to consider in all the\nseven petitions is whether the BGs in question are Unconditional and\nIrrevocable and if so, whether any of the exceptions to the Rule exists and\nhas been established by the Petitioner, so as to be entitled to an injunction\nagainst the encashment of the BGs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">30.    A perusal of the BGs in question, one of which has been extracted\nabove, makes it abundantly clear that the BGs are Unconditional and\nIrrevocable and the Banks have undertaken to honour the claim of the\nbeneficiary, without any demur or protest and de hors and irrespective of\nany disputes between the beneficiary and the Guarantor. Petitioner has\nnot been able to set up any case of egregious fraud with respect to the\ninvocation of the BGs in question. There is only a vague pleading to this\neffect which is not enough for this Court to pass a restraint Order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">31.

However, the\nserious disputes on the merits of the respective claims raised by the\nparties herein cannot be a ground to interfere and restrain the\ninvocation/encashment of the BGs in question. It is a settled law that BG\nis an independent contract between the bank and the beneficiary. Once\nthe beneficiary invokes the BG, the Bank is obliged to honour the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.

It is equally settled law that in terms of the bank\n           guarantee the beneficiary is entitled to invoke the bank\n           guarantee and seek encashment of the amount specified in\n           the bank guarantee. It does not depend upon the result of\n           the decision in the dispute between the parties, in case of the\n           breach. The underlying object is that an irrevocable\n           commitment either in the form of bank guarantee or letters\n           of credit solemnly given by the bank must be honoured. The\n           court exercising its power cannot interfere with enforcement\n           of bank guarantee/letters of credit except only in cases\n           where fraud or special equity is prima facie made out in the\n           case as triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent\n           irretrievable injustice to the parties. The trading operation\n           would not be jettisoned and faith of the people in the\n           efficacy of banking transactions would not be eroded or\n           brought to disbelief. The question, therefore, is whether the\n           petitioner had made out any case of irreparable injury by\n           proof of special equity or fraud so as to invoke the\n           jurisdiction of the Court by way of injunction to restrain the\n           first respondent from encashing the bank guarantee. The\n           High Court held that the petitioner has not made out either.\n           We have carefully scanned the reasons given by the High\n           Court as well as the contentions raised by the parties. On\n           the facts, we do not find that any case of fraud has been\n           made out. The contention is that after promise to extend\n           time for constructing the buildings and allotment of extra\n           houses and the term of bank guarantees was extended, the\n           contract was terminated. It is not a case of fraud but one of\n           acting in terms of contract. It is next contended by Shri G.\n           Nageshwara Rao, the learned counsel for the petitioner,\n           that unless the amount due and payable is determined by a\n           competent court or tribunal by mere invocation of bank\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.                                     Page 31 of 39</span>\n            guarantee or letter of credit pleading that the amount is due\n           and payable by the petitioner, which was disputed, cannot\n           be held to be due and payable in a case. The Court has yet\n           to go into the question and until a finding after trial, or\n           decision is given by a court or tribunal that amount is due\n           and payable by the petitioner, it cannot be held to be due\n           and payable. Therefore, the High Court committed manifest\n           error of law in refusing to grant injunction as the petitioner\n           has made out a prima facie strong case. We find no force in\n           the contention. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708879\" id=\"span_38\">All the clauses of the contract of the bank\n           guarantee are to be read together. Bank guarantee/letters of\n           credit is an independent contract between the bank and the\n           beneficiary. It does not depend on the result of the dispute\n           between the person on whose behalf the bank guarantee was\n           given by the bank and the beneficiary. Though the question\n           was not elaborately discussed, it was in sum answered by\n           this Court in <a href=\"/doc/708879/\" id=\"a_23\">Hindustan Steel Workers Construction\n           Ltd. v. G.S. Atwal</a> &amp;amp; Co. (Engineers) (P) Ltd. [(1995) 6\n           SCC 76] (SCC at p. 79). This Court had held in para 6 that\n           the entire dispute was pending before the arbitrator.\n           Whether, and if so, what is the amount due to the appellant\n           was to be adjudicated in the arbitration proceedings. The\n           order of the learned Single Judge proceeds on the basis that\n           the amounts claimed were not and cannot be said to be due\n           and the bank has violated the understanding between the\n           respondent and the bank in giving unconditional guarantee\n           to the appellant. The learned Judge held that the bank had\n           issued a guarantee in a standard form, covering a wider\n           spectrum than agreed to between the respondent and the\n           bank and it cannot be a reason to hold that the appellant is\n           in any way fettered in invoking the conditional bank\n           guarantee. Similarly, the reasoning of the learned Single\n           Judge that before invoking the performance guarantee the\n           appellant should assess the quantum of loss and damages\n           and mention the ascertained figure, cannot be put forward\n           to restrain the appellant from invoking the unconditional\n           guarantee.

The High\n           Court had issued interim injunction from enforcing the bank\n           guarantee. Interfering with and reversing the order of the\n           High Court, this Court has held in para 23 that a bank must\n           honour its commitment free from interference by the courts.\n           The special circumstances or special equity pleaded in the\n           case that there was a serious dispute on the question as to\n           who has committed the breach of the contract and that\n           whether the amount is due and payable by the contractor to\n           the appellant till the arbitrator declares the award, was not\n           sufficient to make the case an exceptional one justifying\n           interference by restraining the appellant from enforcing the\n           bank guarantee.

The bank had irrevocably promised\n           and undertaken to pay to the Corporation without any\n           demur or damage an amount not exceeding Rs 57,57,970\n           plus interest as per terms and conditions contained in the\n           bank guarantee untrammeled by the bilateral agreement\n           between the petitioner and the first respondent-Corporation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">OMP (I)(COMM) 340/2019 &amp; conn.                                   Page 33 of 39</span>\n            stating the amount claimed was due and payable on account\n           of loss or damage caused to or likely to be caused to or by\n           the Corporation by reason of any breach by the said\n           contract or any of the terms and conditions contained in the\n           said agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disputes\n           raised under the contract in any suit or proceedings\n           pending before any court or tribunal relating thereto. The\n           liability of the bank is absolute and unequivocal; it would\n           thereby be clear that the bank is not concerned with the\n           ultimate decision of a court and a tribunal in its finding\n           after adjudication as to the amount due and payable by the\n           petitioner to the first respondent. What would be material is\n           the quantification of the liability in the letter of revocation.\n           The bank should verify whether the amount claimed is\n           within the terms of the bank guarantee or letter of credit. It\n           is axiomatic that any payment by the bank, obviously be\n           subject to the final decision of the court or the tribunal. At\n           the stage of invocation of bank guarantee, the need for final\n           adjudication and decision on the amount due and payable\n           by the petitioner, would run contrary to the terms of the\n           special contract in which the bank had undertaken to pay\n           the amount due and payable by the contractor. Thus we\n           hold that there is no question of making out any prima facie\n           case much less strong evidence or special equity or\n           exceptional circumstances for interference by way of\n           injunction.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">32.    The argument of the learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioner that\nthe Petitioner is undergoing the Corporate Debt Restructuring Process\nand encashment of the BGs worth over Rs. 100 crores would cause\nirretrievable injury, cannot be a ground to injunct the invocation of the\nBGs. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"188318958\" id=\"span_42\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/188318958/\" id=\"a_25\">Zillion Infra Projects (P) Ltd. v.

In that case an exporter in the U.S.A. entered into\n           an agreement with the Imperial Government of Iran and\n           sought an order terminating its liability on stand by letters\n           of credit issued by an American bank in favour of an\n           Iranian Bank as part of the contract. The relief was sought\n           on account of the situation created after the Iranian\n           revolution when the American Government cancelled the\n           export licences in relation to Iran and the Iranian\n           Government had forcibly taken 52 American citizens as\n           hostages. The U.S. Government had blocked all Iranian\n           assets under the jurisdiction of United States and had\n           cancelled the export contract. The court upheld the\n           contention of the exporter that any claim for damages\n           against the purchaser if decreed by the American Courts\n           would not be executable in Iran under these circumstances\n           and relisation of the bank guarantee/Letters of credit would\n           cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff. This contention was\n           upheld.

SGSL was not a party to the\nsaid Agreements and therefore, in the five out of seven petitions, there\nbeing no Co-ordination Agreements, the BGs cannot be invoked by the\nRespondent. In my view, this contention merits rejection. It is true that\nin OMP (I)(COMM) 349/2019, there is no Co-ordination Agreement but\nit is equally true that the Petitioner is a party to all the said Co-ordination\nAgreements and the Purchase Orders alongwith the Respondent. What is\nof significance is that the BGs have been issued by the Banks on behalf of\nthe Petitioner and under the respective Orders and not on behalf of SGSL.\nThe Clause which allows Respondent to invoke the BGs, other than in\ndefault of Purchase Orders, is relevant to O.M.P. (I) (COMM)\nNos.341/2019 and 342/2019 only. The BGs have been invoked under the\nOrders and not under the Co-ordination Agreement. The relevant portions\nof the Purchase Orders have been extracted in the earlier part of the\njudgment and a bare reading indicates that the PBG was given under the\nPurchase Orders and have thus been rightly invoked by the Respondent.\nIn any event, the dispute with respect to the Co-ordination Agreements\nand the other Agreements regarding the reciprocal obligations of the\nparties would be in the domain of the Arbitrator and cannot be\nadjudicated in this petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">36.
