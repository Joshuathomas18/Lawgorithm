By way of this order, I propose to decide the above mentioned\ntwo petitions filed by the same petitioner on 10th February, 2016\nagainst the respondent. The first petition being O.M.P.

Few facts, which are relevant and mentioned in the pleadings,\nare that the respondent issued Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) bearing\nNo.CS-0330-364-9 dated 13th June, 2008, inviting tenders/bids\nregarding construction work of &#x27;Permanent Township package for\nIndira Gandhi Super Thermal Power Project, Jhajjar, Haryana [3 X\n500 MW]&#x27; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Contract Work&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.1. In furtherance of the aforesaid NIT, the petitioner submitted its\ntender/bid, upon scrutiny of which, the respondent issued the Letter\nof Award (LoA) dated 20th May, 2009, awarding the aforesaid\nContract Work to the petitioner. A formal Contract/Agreement came\nto be executed between the parties on 17th November, 2009. Clause\n56 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC) provides for\nresolution of disputes by way of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.2. It is the case of the petitioner that after having awarded of the\naforesaid     Contract/Agreement,           the       petitioner    mobilized     all     its\nresources and manpower for timely execution of the Contract Works.\nHowever,      the    respondent       failed     to    adhere      to   the covenants\nundertaken by it under the aforesaid Contract/ Agreement, on\naccount of which the Contract Works got delayed. In this regard, the\npetitioner time and again put the respondent to notice of the various\ndelays and lapses attributable to the respondent, all of which\ncontributed to the delay in execution of Contract Works.                         In nut-\nshell, some of the following deficiencies on the part of the\nrespondent were made known to it by the petitioner through various\ncommunications addressed from time to time.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P.

The petitioner has alleged that the respondent issued letter\ndated 18th July, 2014 of part cancellation (being the 1st Part\ncancellation) to the petitioner whereby the remaining work of &quot;C-\nType Quarters&quot; was cancelled/withdrawn from the scope of work\nawarded to the petitioner. By way of the said communication, the\nrespondent       erroneously        and    illegally    sought     to     intimate      the\npetitioner of its intent to get the said withdrawn work completed at\nthe risk and cost of the petitioner and the respondent, yet again in a\ncomplete erroneous and illegal manner, further sought to withdraw\npart    of    the   work     contracted          to   the    petitioner   by    way       of\ncommunication dated 24th October, 2014 (being the 2nd Part\ncancellation), whereby the fencing work of Transformers came to be\nwithdrawn from the petitioner&#x27;s scope of work with the intent of\ngetting the same done at the risk and cost of the petitioner. The\nrelevant date of 3rd Part Cancellation in respect of the balance work\nof C &amp; D Type Quarters under PTC Package is 30th June, 2015 and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016                             Page 3 of 23</span>\n 4th Part cancellation dated 8th July, 2015 in respect of balance work\nof hospital, community centre and training centre under PTC\nPackage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">3.     It is alleged by the petitioner that in the meantime, in view of\nthe action of the respondent, the petitioner by way of its letter dated\n29th July, 2015, inter-alia, highlighting various reasons of delay in\nthe project which were solely attributable to the respondent. As the\ndispute arose the petitioner by virtue of the said letter invoked the\nArbitration Clause for appointment of an independent Arbitrator for\nsettlement of its claims. By way of the said letter, the respondent\nwas informed by the petitioner that as the order of part cancellation\nhad been taken at the highest level of the respondent/employer, any\nforum for resolution of disputes constituted by the said authority and\nin particular, its subordinate was of no legal consequence. Therefore,\nthe petitioner sought for appointment of an independent Arbitrator,\npreferably by a retired High Court Judge, to adjudicate the disputes\nand to provide the petitioner with a panel of independent Arbitrators\nfrom which it could choose an independent Arbitrator. In the\nalternative, the petitioner desired for appointment of a three\nMembers Arbitral Tribunal, comprising of one Arbitrator each\nappointed by both the parties, which nominee Arbitrators would then\nappoint the Presiding/Umpire Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">4.     At the time of invocation of arbitration clause, the request was\nmade to the respondent by the petitioner by way of letter dated 29th\nJuly, 2015 for appointment of an independent sole Arbitrator, who\nwas     not    agreeable       to   appoint      the   Arbitrator   who    is   the\nemployee/Officer of the respondent-Company, as it has personal\ninterest and an aggrieved party to the disputes having arisen\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016                       Page 4 of 23</span>\n between the parties. It is also a matter of fact that the respondent\nby letter dated 19th August, 2015 informed the petitioner that the\nChief Executive Officer of the respondent-Company has been\nappointed as sole Arbitrator.              On 26th September, 2015 it was\ninformed to the petitioner by the respondent that Sh.S.K.Sinha was\nappointed as sole Arbitrator.            It is not denied that he is from the\nsame Department.             The petitioner within the period of less than 3\ndays raised its concern by letter dated 29th September, 2015 and it\nwas also brought to the notice of the respondent that NTPC, who is\npart of the respondent&#x27;s Joint Venture, had in similar circumstances\nappointed sole Arbitrator who is not from the same department\nbeing independent person, for which even the petitioner has no\nobjection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">5.     The first hearing was held on 7th October, 2015 by the\nArbitrator and the petitioner sought time to file the Statement of\nClaim within 60 days therefrom i.e. by 5th December, 2015.\nThereafter, the petitioners vide its letter dated 4th December, 2015\nsought further time of one month to file the Statement of Claim. The\ntime was allowed by the Arbitrator vide his Order dated 7 th\nDecember, 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">6.     On 12th January, 2016 the petitioner informed the respondent\n(including Sh.S.K.Sinha, Chief Executive Officer, APCPL - the\nArbitrator), that the constitution of the alleged Arbitral Tribunal was\nagainst the settled principles of law and it was further informed by\nthe   petitioner      that    it   would    be   approaching   this    Court         for\nappointment of an independent Arbitral Tribunal, on account of\nwhich the Official of the respondent (appointed as the alleged\nArbitrator) should not proceed with the proceedings. However, on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016                        Page 5 of 23</span>\n 22nd January, 2016 Sh.S.K.Sinha vide his communication did not\nagree with the contentions of the petitioner made in letter dated 12th\nJanuary, 2016 and advised the petitioner to attend the hearing of\nthe alleged arbitration proceedings on 16th February, 2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">7.     Before the next date, the present two petitions were filed,\nmainly, on the grounds that the respondent has failed to appoint an\nindependent Arbitrator for adjudication of the disputes between the\nparties. The petitioner is seeking appointment of an independent\nArbitral Tribunal to adjudicate upon the disputes between the\nparties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">8.     In the meanwhile, the balance works of 5th to 8th Parts were\ncancelled as per schedule, as the petitioner was time and again\ninsisting for an independent Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">9.     Counter-affidavit on behalf of the respondent was filed,\nwherein it was stated that the present petition under <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 14</a> of\nthe Act is not maintainable, as the said provision provides that a\nparty can apply to the Court under <a href=\"/doc/409037/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 14(2)</a> of the Act only if\nthere is a controversy regarding the mandate of an Arbitrator\nrequiring to be terminated if he becomes de jure or de facto unable\nto perform his functions or fails to act without undue delay or if he\nwithdraws from his office or the parties agreed to the termination of\nhis mandate.         However, in the present case, the Arbitrator has\nneither withdrawn from his office nor have the parties agreed to\nterminate the mandate of the Arbitrator.           There can be no\ncontroversy in regard to the ground mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 14(1)(b)</a>\nof the Act.       It is further submitted that the Arbitrator has been\nappointed strictly in accordance with Clause 56 of the GCC with its\namendments of the contract in question between the parties.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016            Page 6 of 23</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\"> Therefore, the Arbitrator has not de jure become unable to perform\nhis functions. The Arbitrator is conducting the arbitral proceedings\non each of the dates fixed and, therefore, it cannot be said that he is\nfailing to act without undue delay. In fact, it is the petitioner who\nhas got the matter adjourned on several occasions so as to file the\npresent petition. Even though, the petitioner on 7th October, 2015\nparticipated in the proceedings and agreed to file its Statement of\nClaim but had not raised any challenge to the appointment of the\nArbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">10.    The provision in the Act to challenge the appointment of an\nArbitrator on the ground of alleged bias or non independence exists\nin <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 12</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1983758/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 12(3)</a> provides that an Arbitrator\nmay be challenged only if the circumstances exist that give rise to\njustifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality, or he does\nnot possess the qualifications agreed to by the parties and an\naggrieved party can challenge the Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/163714/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 13(2)</a> of\nthe Act within 15 days of becoming aware of the constitution of the\nArbitral Tribunal. In the present case, the petitioner was informed by\nDGM (CCD-Township) of the respondent-Company on 19th August,\n2015 regarding appointment of the sole Arbitrator under Clause 56\nof the GCC to the Contract. However, the petitioner had not taken\nany steps to challenge the appointment. The said challenge was\nmade before this Court after the expiry of more than four months.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">11.    It is submitted by the respondent that in the present case, the\nArbitrator by his letter dated 22nd January, 2016 rejected the said\nchallenge under <a href=\"/doc/46768/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 13 (4)</a> of the Act on the grounds, firstly,\nthat the appointment was in terms of the Arbitration Clause and\nsecondly, that the challenge was not raised within time. Even if the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016             Page 7 of 23</span>\n challenge is rejected by the Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/46768/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 13(4)</a>, the\nArbitrator has to continue with the arbitral proceedings and to make\nan Arbitral Award. There is no appeal under the Act against the said\norder under <a href=\"/doc/46768/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 13(4)</a>, though <a href=\"/doc/1170374/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 13(5)</a> provides that once\nthe Award is pronounced, the party challenging the Award can make\nan application under <a href=\"/doc/1170374/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 13(5)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">12.    The appointment of the Arbitrator i.e. the Chief Executive\nOfficer of the respondent-Company was in accordance with Clause\n56 of the GCC which provides that all disputes would be referred to\nthe sole Arbitration of the Project In-charge of the Project concerned\nof the owner. It was also provided that there would be no objection\non the ground that the Arbitrator so appointed is an employee of\nrespondent (APCPL) and has dealt with the matter to which the\ncontract relates and that in the course of his duties as such he has\nexpressed views on all or any of the matters in dispute. The contract\nin relation to the present dispute was signed by the petitioner on\n17th November, 2009 and no objection was raised to the arbitration\nclause as contained in Clause 56 of the GCC to the Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">13.    The Arbitrator, though the CEO of the respondent-Company\nand the Project In-charge of the Indira Gandhi Super Thermal Power\nProject, P.O. Jharii, Distt. Jhajjar, Haryana, was not the Engineer In-\ncharge or the day-to-day In-charge of the work, which was to be\nperformed by the petitioner under the contract in question. In fact,\nthe Engineer In-charge for this project is AGM (CCD-Township) who\nis supported by Group of Engineers (Dy. Managers, Managers &amp; Sr.\nManagers) working under him for execution of the work.         Further,\nthe AGM (CCD-Township) reports to AGM (ME/CCD) who in turn\nreports to CEO (APCPL).\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016            Page 8 of 23</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\"> 14.    It is also submitted that the letter dated 21st July, 2015\ngranting extension of time to the petitioner for completing the work,\nwas not issued by the CEO but only the approval was granted by Dy.\nCEO (APCPL) based on the proposal initiated/concurred by Sr.\nManager (Civil), DGM (CCD Township), AGM (ME, CCD), AGM (F&amp;A).\nThus, it cannot be construed from the mere approval granted to the\nextension of time that the CEO was either in day-to-day charge of\nthe contractual work or was involved in the work or was subordinate\nto any such officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">15.    The following decision were referred by the respondent:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_9\">i)    The Supreme Court in its judgment reported as <a href=\"/doc/2073/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Oil\n      Corporation Ltd. v.

Arbitration is a binding voluntary alternative\n            dispute resolution process by a private forum chosen\n            by the parties. It is quite common for Governments,\n            statutory corporations and public sector undertakings\n            while entering into contracts, to provide for settlement\n            of disputes by arbitration, and further provide that the\n            arbitrator will be one of its senior officers. If a party,\n            with open eyes and full knowledge and comprehension\n            of the said provision enters into a contract with a\n            Government       /statutory   corporation/public    sector\n            undertaking containing an arbitration agreement\n            providing that one of its Secretaries/Directors shall be\n            the arbitrator, he cannot subsequently turn around and\n            contend that he is agreeable for settlement of the\n            disputes by arbitration, but not by the named arbitrator\n            who is an employee of the other party.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            14.      No party can say he will be bound by only one\n            part of the agreement and not the other part, unless\n            such other part is impossible of performance or is void\n            being contrary to the provisions of the Act, and such\n            part is severable from the remaining part of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016               Page 9 of 23</span>\n             agreement. The arbitration clause is a package which\n            may provide for what disputes are arbitrable, at what\n            stage the disputes are arbitrable, who should be the\n            arbitrator, what should be the venue, what law would\n            govern the parties, etc. A party to the contract cannot\n            claim the benefit of arbitration under the arbitration\n            clause, but ignore the appointment procedure relating\n            to the named arbitrator contained in the arbitration\n            clause.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            15.

The petitioner had not specifically challenged the appointment\nof sole Arbitrator by filing the written statement before him within\nthe period of 15 days, however, at the same time, in the letter of\ninvocation which was prior to the appointment the petitioner had\nrequested the respondent to appoint an independent Arbitrator i.e.\nbefore his appointment by the respondent.           The extracts of the\nrelevant part are reproduced here as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       &quot;In view of the above circumstances and inaction of APCPL\n       towards settlement of our claims/payments, we hereby\n       invoke Arbitration Clause of the Contract Agreement\n       request your good self to appoint Arbitrator for settlement\n       of our claims according to Clause 56 of GCC of the\n       Contract Agreement.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       However, we want to draw your attention to the legal point\n       that once the order of part cancellation has been passed at\n       the Highest Level of the Owner/Employer, hence, any\n       forum for resolution of dispute constituted by the said\n       authority &amp; particularly its subordinate is of no legal\n       consequence.

In case the decisions referred by both the sides are read in a\nmeaningful manner, it is evident that the reasonable apprehension\nmust be based on cogent evidence. Raising the vague and general\nobjection that the Arbitrator is bias with material is not sufficient\nreason as per un-amended Act as to why the Arbitrator should not\nhave proceeded with the arbitration proceedings and if the Senior\nOfficer had nothing to do with execution of the subject contract,\nthere    cannot      be     no     justification   for    anyone        doubting      his\nindependence or impartially.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">23.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_17\">In   <a href=\"/doc/2073/\" id=\"a_24\">Indian       Oil    Corporation       Limited     &amp;   Ors.      v.

It is true that in various cases, many Courts have consistently\nheld and observed that the policy of the Government/Statutory\nAuthorities/Public        Sector     Undertakings        to   provide/appoint         for\narbitration by an Employee-Arbitrator, is a vexed problem, which\nrequires reconsideration, which is more so in deference to the\nspecific provisions of the new Act reiterating the need for an\nindependent        and     impartial      Arbitrator     which     is    now      being\nimplemented by the Courts in India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">25.

The interest of justice and equity require that where a party\nto the contract disputes the committing of any breach of the\ncondition, the adjudication should be by an independent person or\nbody. As per un-amended Act, 1996 and the <a href=\"/doc/18641578/\" id=\"a_25\">Amended Act, 2015</a>,\nthe main sum and substance is that if the provision of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 12</a> is\nread,      there   would     be    a    justifiable   apprehension      about   the\nindependence or impartiality of an Employee-Arbitrator, such person\nwas the controlling/ dealing authority in regard to the subject\ncontract or if he is a direct subordinate to the Officer whose decision\nis the subject matter of the dispute, in such a case, it would be\nappropriate to appoint an independent Arbitral Tribunal to secure\njustice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">26.     The case of the petitioner was that the main dispute between\nthe parties, inter-alia, relates to the part cancellation of the Contract\nWorks awarded to the petitioner. Clause 41 of the GCC provides for\n&#x27;cancellation of contract in full or in part&#x27;. Reading of the said Clause\nwould show that upon fulfillment of either of the conditions, as\nprescribed under the various sub-clauses [sub-Clauses namely (a) to\nG)] as provided for in Clause 41 of the GCC, the &quot;Accepting\nAuthority&quot; may by a written notice cancel the contract as a whole or\nonly    such       items    of    work     in    default   from   the    contract.\nFurther, in terms of Schedule-A to the GCC, the &quot;Accepting\nAuthority&quot; has been defined as the C.M.D., N.T.P.C. Ltd. or his\nauthorized Executive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">27.     It is a matter of fact that he is CEO and from the same\ndepartment of the respondent Company who is interested/aggrieved\nparty in the dispute. Admittedly, when first time it was informed to\nthe petitioner by Sh.S.K.Sinha, sole Arbitrator by letter dated 28th\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P.

Copy of the letter was also sent to the sole Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">28.    The petitioner has also mentioned in the petition that the\nappointed Arbitrator Sh.S.K.Sinha has also been previously involved\nin cases/Contract Works similar to the one involved in the present\ncase (including the same) on account of his official capacity as held\nin the respondent-Company. In counter-affidavit, there is no denial\non behalf of the respondent on this aspect as to whether Sh.S.K.\nSinha was involved in the other cases of similar nature or not on\naccount of official capacity as alleged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_47\">29.    The respondent cannot deny and has not disputed that by way\nof the said letter of invocation dated 29 th July, 2015, the respondent\nwas pointed out by the petitioner that as the order of part\ncancellation      had     been     taken     at   the   highest      level   of    the\nrespondent/employer,           any     forum      for   resolution    of     disputes\nconstituted by the said authority and in particular, its subordinate\nwas of no legal consequence. Therefore, the petitioner sought for\nappointment of an independent Arbitrator, preferably a retired High\nCourt Judge to adjudicate the disputes and to provide the petitioner\nwith a panel of independent Arbitrators from which it could choose\nan independent Arbitrator. In the alternative, the petitioner desired\nfor appointment of a three Members Arbitral Tribunal, comprising of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P.

In view of the circumstances mentioned above, I do not agree\nwith the submissions of Mr.Vikas Singh that the petition is not\nmaintainable as the petitioner has not raised its protest within 15\ndays as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 13</a> of the Act, as admittedly the\nname of Sh.S.K.Sinha was communicated to the petitioner by the\nrespondent and the protest was raised by the petitioner by letter\ndated 29th September, 2015 with a copy thereof to the sole\nArbitrator as well. Even otherwise, in the letter of invocation dated\n29th July, 2015 the first demand was made by the petitioner to\nappoint an independent sole Arbitrator. In the present case, before\nthe commencement of proceedings, the Arbitrator had knowledge\nabout the said objection raised by the petitioner. No doubt, <a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\n13</a> provided a statutory period of 15 days time to raise the protest.\nThe petitioner in the present case in advance, i.e. 29th July, 2015\nitself raised its grievance.         The notice of appointment of Mr.Sinha\nwas issued on 26th September, 2015 by the respondent.                    The\npetitioner within three days referred its earlier letter and raised its\nobjections with the copy thereof to the sole Arbitrator. Therefore, I\ndo not agree that there is no compliance at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">31.    The other objection of Mr. Vikas Singh has also no force that\nsince the petitioner has joined the proceedings, therefore, the\npresent petition is not maintainable. Admittedly, the petitioner\nappeared before the Arbitrator under protest and informed him as\nwell as the respondent in advance that the petitioner has objection\nfor his appointment.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P.

Although the plea/objection of the petitioner may not be\ncovered under the un-amended Act but it is directly covered under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/18641578/\" id=\"a_29\">Amended Act, 2015</a>. No doubt, the invocation is based on un-\namended Act i.e. on 29th July, 2015. The amendment was effective\nfrom 23rd October, 2015 but the petitioner in its invocation letter\nitself has requested for an independent sole Arbitrator who had\ninformed the respondent that the appointed Arbitrator is an\nExecutive of the respondent-Company and he has been involved in\nthe   execution       of   some     contracts.         The    appointment     of   an\nindependent Arbitrator will strength the cause of justice and it will\nenhance the faith of each party in the arbitral process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">33.    The Fifth Schedule i.e. supplementary provision read with\nSection 12(l)(b) mandates that the appointment made by any party\nwhich would give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence or\nimpartiality of Arbitrator if he has relationship with the parties or\ncounsel or the Arbitrator is an employee, consultant, advisor or has\nany other past or present business relationship with a party,                      the\nsame would give rise to justifiable doubts.                  Similarly, the Seventh\nSchedule read with Section 12 (5) mandates that there shall not be\nany Arbitrator&#x27;s relationship with the parties or counsel who should\nalso not be an employee, consultant, advisor or has any other past\nor present business relationship with a party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">34.    When all these facts were pointed out to the learned counsel\nfor the respondent and ask him to take the instruction as to whether\nhis client is agreeable to provide the list of panel Arbitrators\nof the respondent-Company so that the independent Arbitrator be\nappointed,      his   answer      was     that   the    matter    be   decided     on\nmerit.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P.

In the present case, this Court finds reasonable apprehension\nin the mind of the petitioner.                   It is not a vague and general\nobjection. The reasons are mentioned in earlier part of paras 25 &amp;\n26 of my judgment. This case is at the initial stage. The Arbitrator\nas per clause, appointed by the respondent is the CEO of the\nrespondent         Company       and    from      the   same    department.     The\nrespondent Company is a Private Limited Company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">36.    The most surprising factor is about the language of the\narbitration clause. For the sake of convenience, the relevant part of\nclause is extracted as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       &quot;It is also a term of his Contract that no person other than\n       a person appointed by CMD, NTPC Ltd as aforesaid should\n       act as Arbitrator and if for any reason, that is not possible,\n       the matter is not to be referred to Arbitration at all.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">       The language used in part of arbitration clause is very peculiar\nand unacceptable to the Court. It indicates that if any Arbitrator as\nper the respondent&#x27;s choice is not appointed, the Company would\nnot even go for arbitration. The said expression does not convey the\nmessage       of    neutrality    and     the     air   of   independence   and/or\nimpartiality, though the respondent at the end of the day may be\nimpartial. Even on applying this simple logic of any case, in order to\nget any work of the project, party has to accept the said arbitration\nclause on dotted lines, otherwise, it may not be awarded the work at\nthe project.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">37.    It is common parlance oft-quoted aphorism &quot;Not only must\nJustice be done; it must also be seen to be done.&quot;                  The reason is\nthat rules are moral constructs that are meant to serve higher value.\nThe amendment of 2015 emphasize that the existence of any\nrelationship or interest of any kind is likely to give rise to justifiable\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P. No.136/2016                        Page 21 of 23</span>\n doubts as to his neutrality is to be avoided or any employee,\nmanager, director, or has past or present business or has a\ncontrolling influence, relationship with a party to the dispute should\nnot be appointed as an Arbitrator. Similarly, it is rightly mandated\nin the <a href=\"/doc/18641578/\" id=\"a_30\">Fifth Schedule of the Amended Act, 2015</a> (3 of 2016) that if\nthe Arbitrator has within the past three years been appointed on two\nor more occasions by one of the parties and the Arbitrator has\nserved within the three years in another arbitration on a related\nissue involving one of the parties, his appointment would give rise to\njustifiable    doubts     as    to    the   independence      or   impartiality         of\narbitrators. No doubt, the invocation was about three months prior\nto amendment.           But the Court has to keep in mind about the\npurpose and scope of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">38.    In the present case, no doubt, the invocation was on the basis\nof un-amended Act but still under <a href=\"/doc/18641578/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 12</a> of the Act would give\nthe similar indication.              The sole Arbitrator appointed by the\nrespondent admittedly is CEO and Executive of the respondent-\nCompany who is also from the same office/department. In order to\nmaintain the neutrality, or to avoid any doubt in the mind of the\npetitioner and the reasons given in the petition, it would be\nappropriate that independent sole Arbitrator should be appointed as\nultimately neutral person has merely to decide the dispute between\nthe parties. Even, the object and scope of the Act says so, that an\narbitration     procedure       should      be   fair   and   unbias.    Thus,     the\nappointment of Mr.S.K. Sinha, CEO of the respondent Company is\nterminated and once the Arbitrator&#x27;s appointment is terminated, the\nCourt can consider the prayer of the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">OMP (T) (Comm) No.13/2016 &amp; Arb.P.

The prayers in both the petitions are allowed, to the extent\nthat within four weeks, the respondent would suggest the names of\nthree panel Arbitrators which are from different departments of the\nrespondent to the petitioner who may choose one of them within the\nnext two weeks and the said Arbitral Tribunal would adjudicate the\ndisputes between the parties. In failure to do so by the respondent\nwithin the time granted, the petitioner would be entitled to revive\nthe petitions and under those circumstances, the Court shall appoint\nthe    sole    Arbitrator     from     the       list   maintained   by    the    Delhi\nInternational Arbitration Centre.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">40.
