Shri Chirag Sukhwani, learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner invited Court&#x27;s attention to the arbitration clause in the\nagreement at page no.91 in the compilation. Clause­30 indicates that\nthe dispute to be referred to tribunal as per separate sheet attached.\nPart of the clause­30 is scored off but the title remains clearly indicating\nthat the dispute is required to be referred to the arbitration.              It is\npertinent to note that the tender document­contract starts from page\nno.74 in the compilation and in that document clause­30 figures at page­\n91 bearing the title the rest of the clause is scored off without any\nsignature. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the scoring\noff could be said to be only not applicable part as if the scored of clause\nis read then, it was in respect of referring the dispute to the Arbitration\nTribunal, Gujarat State, which is in fact constituted under the provision\nof Gujarat Public Works Contract Dispute Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992.\nThe provisions of Section­2 of the Gujarat Public Works Contract Dispute\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 Page 7 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                       Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">            C/IAAP/111/2018                                        ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\nArbitration Tribunal Act, 1992 confines the work contract as define in\nclause­K of Section­1 of Sub­section­2.

The respondent\nbeing a local authority and not notified as per the provisions of Public\nWorks Contract Dispute Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992, the disputes\nbetween the petitioner and the respondents were required to be\nadjudicated by domestic arbitrator and it would not be covered by the\ndisputes that is to be adjudicated by arbitration under the tribunal as per\nthe Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_22\">5.

It\n    was further noticed that in the absence of such\n    Notification,     the    Ahmedabad        Municipal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                               Page 9 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\"> C/IAAP/111/2018                                       ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n    Corporation was not a &quot;Public Undertaking&quot; and\n    the contract entered into by it with the appellant\n    could not, therefore, be termed as a &quot;Works\n    Contract&quot; as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1561485/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 2(1)(k)</a> of the\n    aforesaid Act. The High Court, therefore, held\n    that the Arbitration Tribunal, Gujarat State,\n    would have no jurisdiction to entertain the\n    disputes between the parties emanating from the\n    Work Order in question.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">    9.     The High Court then went on to consider\n    the applicability of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_10\">Arbitration and\n    Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, to the facts of the case.\n    The High Court took note of the fact that the\n    Agreement between the parties, and more\n    particularly the Arbitration Agreement, did not\n    lay down any procedure for appointing an\n    Arbitrator or Arbitrators. Accordingly, in the\n    absence of such procedure, the Designated Court\n    could not invoke its jurisdiction under Sub­\n    section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act, which\n    contemplates a situation, where the appointment\n    procedure as agreed to by the parties under Sub­\n    section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11</a> is not followed. The\n    High Court, therefore, while rejecting the\n    applicability of the <a href=\"/doc/134104933/\" id=\"a_13\">Gujarat Tribunal Act</a>, also\n    closed the doors for relief under the provisions of\n    the 1996 Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">    10. The said order of the High Court, which\n    has been challenged in this appeal, therefore,\n    gives rise to the question as to whether in the\n    absence of any procedure in the Arbitration\n    clause for the appointment of an Arbitrator, can\n    the Chief Justice of the High Court or the\n    Designated Court appoint an Arbitrator under\n    <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act in 7 terms of the\n    Agreement between the parties to have their\n    disputes settled by arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">    19. We have carefully considered the\n    submissions made on behalf of the respective\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                        Page 10 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                              Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> C/IAAP/111/2018                                           ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n    parties and it appears that we are called upon to\n    decide two questions in order to decide this\n    appeal. The first and possibly basic question is\n    whether in the absence of a Notification in the\n    Official Gazette, the Municipal Corporation can\n    at all be considered as a Public Authority for the\n    purpose of Section 2(1)(k) of the Gujarat\n    Tribunal Act, 1992. The other question is\n    whether the absence of a procedure for\n    appointment of an Arbitrator in the Arbitration\n    Agreement itself, would constitute a bar for the\n    appointment of an Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n    11(6)</a> or any other provision of the 1996 Act,\n    when not only the parties to these proceedings,\n    but the High Court as well, had arrived at a\n    conclusion that the provisions of the Gujarat\n    Tribunal Act, 1992, would not be applicable in\n    the instant case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">    20. In this regard, we are inclined to accept the\n    submissions of Mr. Gambhir notwithstanding the\n    fact that the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation\n    had not been notified to be a &quot;Public\n    Undertaking&quot; as defined in Section 2(1)(iii) of\n    the Gujarat Tribunal Act, 1992. There is no\n    dispute that the Ahmedabad Municipal\n    Corporation is a local authority and it could\n    assume the garb of a &quot;Public Undertaking&quot; only\n    pursuant to a Notification published in that\n    regard in the Official Gazette. On the other hand,\n    even if Form B­I loses its relevance as far as the\n    present contract is concerned, since the parties\n    have agreed to resolution of their disputes by\n    arbitration, the provisions of Sub­section (5) of\n    the 1996 Act can be pressed into service to enable\n    the parties to invoke the powers of the Chief\n    Justice to appoint an Arbitrator. The stand taken\n    by Mr. Divan is highly technical and is not in aid\n    of resolution of the disputes between the parties\n    by an Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">    21.     While   recognizing     the   right   of    the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                        Page 11 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                  Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> C/IAAP/111/2018                                       ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n    appellant to approach the Chief Justice or the\n    Designated Court under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\n    1996 Act, the stand of the respondent\n    Corporation has been that the party should be\n    relegated to suit, which is quite contrary to the\n    stand taken by it in the case of other employees.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">    22. <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act deals\n    exclusively with the appointment of Arbitrators.\n    Sub­section (2) provides that the parties are free\n    to agree on a procedure for appointing the\n    Arbitrator or Arbitrators but subject to Sub­\n    section (6) which provides that if an agreed\n    procedure had not been acted upon, the parties\n    could approach the Chief Justice or his Designate\n    for appointment of an Arbitrator. Sub­sections\n    (3), (4) and (5) contemplate different situations\n    in which the Chief Justice or his Designate could\n    be requested to appoint an Arbitrator. In our\n    view, in the facts of this case, the answer to the\n    question thrown up in this appeal lies in Sub­\n    clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act, which\n    reads as follows :­\n\n\n         &quot;11 (5) Failing any agreement referred to\n         in sub­section (2), in an arbitration with\n         a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to\n         agree on the arbitrator within thirty days\n         from receipt of a request by one party\n         from the other party to so agree the\n         appointment shall be made, upon request\n         of a party, by the Chief Justice or any\n         person or institution designated by him.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">    23. Having arrived at the aforesaid conclusion,\n    the only question that remains to be decided is\n    whether this matter should be remitted to the\n    High Court for appointment of an Arbitrator or\n    whether we should ourselves appoint an\n    Arbitrator in terms of the Arbitration Agreement.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                        Page 12 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                              Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">          C/IAAP/111/2018                                        ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">             Remitting the matter to the High Court would\n             only mean another round of litigation, whereas if\n             the appointment is made by us, the matter will\n             achieve finality, which would ultimately be\n             beneficial for all concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">             24. We, accordingly, allow the appeal and\n             appoint Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice C.K. Thakker, a\n             former Judge of the Supreme Court, presently\n             settled at D­64, Akash Towers, Judges&#x27; Bungalow\n             Road, Vastrapur, Ahmedabad to be the\n             Arbitrator for settlement of the disputes which\n             have arisen between the parties. The learned\n             Arbitrator shall fix his own fees and shall also\n             formulate the procedure to be adopted by him\n             during the arbitration proceedings. The\n             Arbitrator shall try and publish his Award as\n             expeditiously as possible, but positively within six\n             months from the date of entering upon the\n             Reference. The Arbitrator will also decide the\n             venue and sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal in\n             consultation with the parties. The judgment and\n             order of the High Court impugned in this appeal\n             is, accordingly, set aside. The costs of this appeal\n             shall be the costs in the arbitration proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">6.

Relevant paragraphs whereof are set­out as\nunder :­</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                    Page 16 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                           Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\"> C/IAAP/111/2018                                         ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">    2.     This request for appointment of arbitrator\n    is opposed by the Panchayat on two grounds.\n    Firstly, that the work order was issued by\n    Panchayat at the instance of the Government and\n    that therefore, in terms of the said arbitration\n    clause, the disputes must be referred to\n    Arbitration Tribunal constituted under the\n    <a href=\"/doc/16512451/\" id=\"a_26\">Gujarat Public Works Contracts Disputes\n    Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992</a>. Second ground\n    of opposition is that if it is held that such dispute\n    would not be maintainable before the Tribunal, it\n    must be treated that there is no arbitration\n    clause and therefore, also request to appoint\n    arbitrator cannot be made.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">    3.     Both the grounds of opposition cannot be\n    accepted. Firstly, respondent Amreli District\n    Panchayat is admittedly not a notified authority\n    in terms of clause(k) of subsection(1) of <a href=\"/doc/187450858/\" id=\"a_27\">section\n    2</a> of the Gujarat Public Works Contracts Disputes\n    Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992 , which defines\n    the term work contract as under :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">         &quot;(k) Works contract means a contract\n         made by the State Government or the\n         public undertaking with any other person\n         for the execution of any of its works\n         relating to construction, repairs or\n         maintenance of any building or\n         superstructure,    dam,    weir, canal,\n         reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge,\n         culvert, factory or workshop or of such\n         other work of the State Government or,\n         as the case may be, of the public\n         undertaking, as the State Government\n         may, by notification in the official Gazete\n         specify and includes\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">         (i) a contract made for the supply of\n         goods relating to the execution of any of\n         such works,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">         (ii) a contract made by the Central Stores\n         Purchase Organisation of the State\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                         Page 17 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">            C/IAAP/111/2018                                         ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n                    Government for purchase or sale of\n                    goods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                    (iii) Words and expressions used and not\n                    defined in this Act but defined in the\n                    <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_28\">Arbitration Act</a>, shall have the meanings\n                    assigned to them in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_29\">Arbitration Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">               4.    In terms of such provision, thus the\n               arbitration contract means a contract made by\n               the State Government or the public undertaking\n               with any other person for execution of any of its\n               works relating to construction repair etc. as the\n               State Government may by notification in official\n               gazette specify.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_55\">5.     The contract in the nature of work order is\n               admittedly issued by respondent District\n               Panchayat and not by the State Government.\n               There is thus no privity of contract between the\n               petitioner and the Government. Coming to the\n               question of existence of arbitration agreement,\n               issue is squarely covered by the judgment of the\n               Supreme Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_30\">Om Construction\n               Company v.

That clause 10 was never intended to be an\n    arbitration agreement is evident from the contract\n    itself. It is relevant to note the Standard Conditions\n    of Contract of the state government, as originally\n    formulated consisted a provision (Clause 23) relating\n    to settlement of disputes by arbitration, which is\n    extracted below :\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">         &quot;Except where otherwise provided in the\n         contract, all questions and disputes relating\n         to the meaning of the specifications, designs,\n         drawings and instructions herein before\n         mentioned and as to the quality of\n         workmanship, or materials used on the\n         work, or as to any other question, claim,\n         right, matter or thing whatsoever, in any\n         way arising out of or relating to the contract,\n         designs, drawing, specifications, estimates,\n         instructions, orders or these conditions, or\n         otherwise concerning the work, or the\n         execution, or failure to execute the same,\n         whether arising during the progress of the\n         work or after the completion or\n         abandonment thereof shall be referred to the\n         sole arbitration of a Superintending Engineer\n         of the State Public Works Department\n         unconnected with the work at any stage\n         nominated by the Chief Engineer concerned.\n         If there be no such Superintending Engineer,\n         it should be refereed to the sole arbitration of\n         Chief Engineer concerned. It will be no\n         objection to any such appointment that the\n         arbitrator so appointed is a government\n         servant. The award of the arbitrator so\n         appointed shall be final, conclusive and\n         binding on all parties to this Contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">    24. The abovesaid clause was deleted by the State\n    Government from the Standard Conditions of\n    Contract by official Memorandum dated 24.12.1981.\n    Contracts entered by the State Government thereafter\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                           Page 22 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                    Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\"> C/IAAP/111/2018                                               ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n    did not have the said arbitration clause, though the\n    other Conditions of Contract remained the same. The\n    contracts in all these cases are of a period subsequent\n    to 24.12.1981 and the Conditions of Contract\n    forming part of these contracts do not contain the\n    arbitration clause. When the State Government has\n    consciously and intentionally deleted the provision\n    for arbitration from its contracts, it will be a travesty\n    of justice to read another clause in the contract\n    providing for execution of non­tendered items and the\n    method of determination of the rates therefor, as a\n    provision for arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">    25. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168696\" id=\"span_72\">In fact, in <a href=\"/doc/168696/\" id=\"a_36\">Executive Engineer RCO vs. Suresh\n    Chandra Panda</a> [1999 (9) SCC 92], this Court\n    considered the effect of the said clause relating to\n    execution of non­tendered items, vis­`­vis clause 23 in\n    a pre­1981 contract. This court held that the said\n    clause (then numbered as clause 11, numbered as\n    clause 10 in subsequent contracts) was a provision\n    which excluded the issue relating to finality of rates,\n    from the scope of arbitration agreement contained in\n    clause 23 on the following reasoning : (SCC p.94,\n    para­4)\n\n\n\n         &quot;4.        Under Clause 11 of the contract,\n         there is an elaborate provision dealing with\n         the power of the Engineer­in Charge to make\n         any alterations or additions to the original\n         specifications,     drawings,     designs     and\n         instructions. It, inter alia, provides that if for\n         such alterations or additions no rate is\n         specified in the contract, then the rates which\n         are entered in the sanctioned schedule of\n         rates of the locality during the period when\n         the work is being carried out, would be paid.\n         However, if this class of work, not provided\n         for in the sanctioned schedule of rates then\n         the contractor has the right, in the manner\n         specified in that clause, to inform the\n         Engineer­in­Charge of the rate at which he\n         intends to carry out that work. If the\n         Engineer­in­ Charge does not agree to this\n         rate he is given the liberty to cancel his order\n         and arrange to carry out such class of work\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                           Page 23 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">          C/IAAP/111/2018                                             ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n                  in such manner as he may consider\n                  advisable. The clause further provides that if\n                  the contractor commences such additional\n                  work or incurs any expenditure in respect of\n                  it before the rate are determined as specified\n                  in that clause, then the rate or rates shall be\n                  as fixed by the Engineer­in­Charge. In the\n                  event of a dispute, the decision of the\n                  Superintendent Engineer of the circle will be\n                  final. Under Clause 23, except as otherwise\n                  provided in the contract, all disputes are\n                  arbitrable as set out in that clause. The\n                  finality of rates, therefore, under Clause 11 is\n                  a provision to the contrary in the contract\n                  which is excluded from Clause 23.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">                    Thus, even when the Standard Conditions\n             of Contract contained a provision for arbitration\n             (vide clause 23), clause 10 was considered to be\n             a provision dealing with a matter excepted from\n             arbitration. Be that as it may. The proviso to\n             clause 10, which provides that the decision of the\n             Superintending Engineer is `final&#x27;, merely\n             discloses an intention to exclude the rates for\n             extra items decided by the Superintending\n             Engineer from the scope of arbitration, as an\n             excepted matter, when there was an arbitration\n             agreement (clause 23) in the contract. When the\n             arbitration agreement was deleted, provision\n             dealing with non­tendered items can not be\n             described as an arbitration agreement. Be that as\n             it may.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">10.          Learned Advocate General further relied upon the decision\nof Supreme Court in case of M/s.

The factum of existence of dispute cannot be denied by\nanyone as could be seen from the submission made by the counsel for\nthe petitioner and incorporated hereinabove in paragraph nos.1 to 2.5.\ntherefore, the existence of dispute is not in question. The fact remains to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                   Page 24 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                             Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">          C/IAAP/111/2018                                      ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\nbe noted that the respondent though is a Government organization but\nnot notified as public undertaking under the provision of the Gujarat\nPublic Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal act, 1992\nhereinafter referred to as the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_37\">Gujarat Act</a>, for the sake of brevity. The\nfact also requires to be borne in mind that all the Government agencies\nand public sector undertakings are under obligation to incorporate the\narbitration clause and absence thereof is always treated as an aberration\nand deviation.     The contract, work order, and agreement with the\ngovernmental bodies or public authorities and public undertaking is\nessentially required to carry forward the policy accepted by not only the\nGovernment of India but the State of Gujarat and other states that there\nhas to be an effective dispute resolution mechanism and arbitration\nbeing one of them, it has been generally observed that in all such\ncontracts there is always an arbitration clause. The standard contract\nforms therefore, are prepared and picking up any one such standard\ncontract or terms and condition of contract would invariably contain\narbitration clause providing for dispute to be resolved by arbitration\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_38\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> (hereinafter referred to\nas the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_39\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a> for the sake of brevity). In the instant case,\nthe tender document and agreement was one such standard contract in\nwhich the Clause­30 as it stood had figured, but as the respondent being\nnot a notified public undertaking under the provision of the Gujarat\nArbitration Tribunal Act, the same procedure could not be attracted nor\nthe tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction would be available for resolving the dispute\nunder the contract. The procedure being not available under the <a href=\"/doc/134104933/\" id=\"a_40\">Gujarat\nTribunal Act</a>, it appears that there was mentioning that the inapplicable\nwould be scored off. However, the Clause­30 has not been scored off\nand the captioned clearly indicative of the parties&#x27; intention to refer the\ndispute to the tribunal also not scored off. What has been scored off is\nonly procedure.     A fine question arises therefore, as to whether can\nrespondent be justified in contending that in this contract alone there\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                Page 25 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">           C/IAAP/111/2018                                         ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas an intention on the part of the parties not to resort to arbitration\nproceedings at all for resolving the dispute. It is required to be noted\nthat, it is never a case of the respondent that they are at liberty to make\na deviation from the avowed policy of the state of referring the dispute\nto arbitration. The Court hastened to add here that the provision of law\nis unequivocally clear that the parties&#x27; agreement for arbitration as per\nthe contract is sine quo none for invoking arbitration. Therefore, if one\nlooks at the contract paper produced on record one would come to know\nthat wherever the intention to delete a clause found to be unwarranted\nin the contract indicating deviation from the standard format of contract,\nthe word delete is mentioned against the clause. The learned counsel\nfor the petitioner is therefore justified in inviting Court&#x27;s attention to the\nvarious clauses indicating that at many a places the clause contain the\nword deleted. Meaning thereby the standard format was not adhered to\nand there were some deviation. The Court&#x27;s attention was invited to the\nClause no.24 against which the word &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned, Clause no.25\nagainst which the word &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned. Clause no.31 against which\nthe word &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned.           Clause no.45 the word &#x27;deleted&#x27;\nmentioned. Clause no.47 the word &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned, Clause nos.73,\n74 and 75 the words &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned and there are clauses where\neither the entire clause is scored off or a part thereof is scored off. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_82\">The\nClause 60 in respect of price variation is scored off entirely along with\nthe caption and 60A is inserted. Similarly, Clauses 72, 73 and 77 have\nbeen scored off along with their captions. As against this, Clause no.30\nclearly indicate that the said clause is partly retained as the scoring off is\nonly qua the procedure as could be seen from page no.97 where the\nclause 30 the arbitration is figuring.           The learned counsel for the\npetitioner&#x27;s reliance upon the observation of <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_41\">Om Construction</a> (supra)\nwould therefore, clearly indicate that the lack of procedure or\nprescription of the procedure cannot permit parties to wriggle out of\ntheir initial agreement to submit to the arbitration.

For the aforesaid reasons, this Court is of the view that\nClause 30 and its partial scoring off and leaving the Clause 30 and its\ncaption intact with assurance of supply a separate sheet for the\nprocedure which have been established by the petitioner would clearly\nsuggest that the parties were in agreement to refer the dispute to the\narbitration and 30 being the clause for arbitration, the lack of providing\nprocedure or omission to provide procedure would not nullify the\nintention of the parties to refer the matter to the arbitration tribunal. In\nthis view of the mater, this Court is of the view that the petitioner made\nout a case for invoking arbitration between the parties for the disputes\nand it is needless to say that the arbitrator has to be appointed for\nresolution of the dispute and this order and observations would not\npreclude the parties to in urging the contentions as permissible under\nlaw before the arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">13.            In view of whatever stated hereinabove, as this Court is\nsatisfied qua existence of dispute and the arbitration clause, the Court\nneeds to exercise power under Section­11 of the Act for appointing the\narbitrator for resolving the dispute. The matter be posted on any Friday\nso that the parties may arrive at a consensual name agreed by both the\nparties for acting as an arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                  Page 27 of 28</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                       Downloaded on : Sat Aug 03 22:34:32 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">              C/IAAP/111/2018                                   ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">14.
