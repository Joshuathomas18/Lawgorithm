The logic of the doctrine of separability is that when parties to a\n         \n\n\n\n    business transaction agree to resolve their disputes by proceedings before an\n\n    arbitral tribunal, the business understanding which leads them to take that\n\n    course must be imparted a robust meaning. In making a choice of an arbitral\n\n\n\n\n\n    forum over the municipal courts of a jurisdiction, particularly in a transnational\n\n    contract, parties place their confidence in the efficiency and procedural\n\n    flexibility of arbitral proceedings. It would indeed be against the common\n\n\n\n\n\n    grain of business expectations to assume that despite a binding agreement on\n\n    arbitration as a preferred form of dispute resolution, parties yet left some\n\n    disputes over their substantive rights and obligations under the contract to be\n\n    resolved by the courts of a municipal jurisdiction. Courts will not imply that\n\n    parties intended such an exclusion absent an unmistakable expression of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 27/08/2013 21:18:22 :::</span>\n     VBC                                       18/37                       appl206.13-16.8\n\n\n    intent to the contrary.

And for valid reason, quite apart from the need to preserve the\n\n\n\n\n                                                               \n    business efficacy of commercial dealings.

Hence, an arbitration agreement can and does survive a\n\n    termination, repudiation or frustration of the contract.

In para 30 of the judgment, Mr.Justice Sarkar held as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                 &quot;It seems to me that the respective nature of accord and\n                 satisfaction and arbitration clause makes it impossible for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                              \n                 former to destroy the latter. An accord and satisfaction only\n                 releases the parties from the obligations under a contract but does\n                 not affect the arbitration clause in it, for as Lord Macmillan said,\n                 the arbitration clause does not impose on one of the parties an\n                 obligation in favour of the other but embodies an agreement that\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n                 if any dispute arises with regard to the obligations which the one\n                 party has undertaken to the other, such dispute shall be settled by\n                                    \n                 arbitration. A dispute whether the obligations under a contract\n                 have been discharged by an accord and satisfaction is no less a\n                 dispute regarding the obligations under the contract. Such a\n                 dispute has to be settled by arbitration if it is within the scope of\n                                   \n                 arbitration clause and either party wants that to be done. That\n                 cannot be unless the arbitration clause survives the accord and\n                 satisfaction. If that dispute is not within the arbitration clause,\n                 there can of course be no arbitration, but the reason for that would\n                 not be that the arbitration clause has ceased to exist but that the\n            \n\n                 dispute is outside its scope. I am not saying that it is for the\n                 arbitrator to decide whether the arbitration clause is surviving; that\n         \n\n\n\n                 may in many cases have to be decided by the Court. That would\n                 depend on the form of the arbitration agreement and on that\n                 aspect of the matter it is not necessary to say anything now for the\n                 question does not arise.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">    24.

The other clauses set out the obligations which the\n               parties undertake towards each other hinc inde; but the arbitration\n               clause does not impose on one of the parties an obligation in\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n               favour of the other.

The contract is not annihilated,\n\n    but the obligations under it cease to be enforceable. Consequently, it is that\n            \n\n    when an action is brought for the appropriate remedy for non performance of\n         \n\n\n\n    these obligations that an accord and satisfaction furnishes a good defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">    The Supreme Court noted that the defence was not that the contract has\n\n    come to an end but, that its breach has been satisfied by accord and\n\n\n\n\n\n    satisfaction and the Plaintiff in the action is not entitled to the usual remedy for\n\n    the breach. It was in these circumstances that Justice Sarkar thought that\n\n    arbitration clause did survive to settle the dispute as to whether there was or\n\n\n\n\n\n    was not an accord and satisfaction.

Absence of such a provision in Part II Chapter I is\n                suggestive of the requirement for the court to determine the\n            \n\n                ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 45</a>, at the threshold itself.

Such determination\n                by the court in accordance with law would certainly attain finality\n                and would not be open to question by the Arbitral Tribunal, even\n\n\n\n\n\n                as per the principle of prudence.

Undoubtedly, there may\n                                 \n    be cases where the arbitration agreement may perish with the main contract\n\n    itself.

But even in such a case, the reason why\n\n    the arbitration agreement perishes is because, in the finding of the Court, the\n\n    arbitration agreement itself is found not to have been executed by both the\n\n\n\n\n\n    parties.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">    29.

The doctrine of separability\n                underlines the potential width of an arbitration agreement because\n                it establishes that an arbitration agreement has a separate life\n                from the matrix contract for which it provides the means of\n\n\n\n\n                                                             \n                resolving disputes. This enables the arbitration agreement to\n                survive breach or termination of the matrix contract of which it\n                forms part. The consequence of this separate existence is that\n                even if the matrix contract has been         brought to an end, for\n                example by accepted repudiation or frustration, the arbitration\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n                agreement continues in being in order to deal with any disputes in\n                respect of liabilities under the matrix contract arising before or\n                after termination.&quot;ig\n                                 \n    Russell on Arbitration restates the position that <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 7</a> of the Arbitration\n\n    Act, 1996 in the U.K. enables the arbitration agreement to survive not just the\n\n    termination or breach of the matrix contract but even if the contract in which it\n            \n\n\n    is contained is regarded as invalid, non-existent or ineffective.        Moreover,\n         \n\n\n\n    even where the matrix contract is held to be void, the arbitration agreement\n\n    may still be upheld as a valid and independent agreement so that any dispute\n\n\n\n\n\n    must be referred to arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">    30.

The\n                                 \n    disputes and differences which arose over the performance of the obligation\n\n    of the Appellant    and the pre-emptive right of the First Respondent to\n                                \n    purchase, led to the invocation of <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 9</a> by the First Respondent and an\n\n    injunctive order of a Learned Single Judge of this Court restraining the\n            \n\n    Appellant from transferring the shares to a third party.

It is in that sense that the SPA is stated by the\n\n    parties to have been rendered null and void. Clearly, it is not that the SPA\n\n    was regarded as having never come into existence at all or for the matter of\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n    being non est or void at its inception.

What the MOU did was to substitute the obligation\n\n    to perform the right of pre-emption by a substituted or altered obligation, but\n            \n\n    that was to be in performance of the obligation which emanated from Clause\n         \n\n\n\n    8 of the SPA. Hence, though the parties have used the expression that the\n\n    SPA would be treated as null and void, their language must be imported a\n\n    business or common sense understanding which meant that the parties\n\n\n\n\n\n    envisaged that the obligation in relation to the balance performance under the\n\n    SPA would stand altered or substituted by the terms of the MOU.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">    33.
