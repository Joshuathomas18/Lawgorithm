Briefly stated, the facts are that the appellant and\n\nthe respondent herein had entered into a commercial\n\ncontract in which there was a provision for arbitration.\n\nCertain disputes having arisen between the parties, the\n\nmatter was referred to arbitration. The clause pertaining\n\nto arbitration in the contract reads as under:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                       4</span>\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;Governing Law and Rules\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">7.    The contract upon                which      the\nClaimant relies contained the following\nprovision:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Governing law and Arbitration\n\nThe governing Law of this contract shall\nbe the law of Singapore.

The language of the\narbitration shall be English.</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">A party who is not a party to this\nContract      has    no     rights     under      the\nContracts (Rights of third <a href=\"/doc/790676/\" id=\"a_5\">Parties) Act</a>\n2001 to enforce any terms of this\nContract.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                              5</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.   In accordance with the said clause, the matter was\n\nreferred to a sole arbitrator at Singapore. In Singapore,\n\nan   award    was   made   by    the   sole   Arbitrator   on\n\n28.05.2010.    Being aggrieved by the said award, the\n\nappellant herein filed A.S.No.68/2010 under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 34</a>\n\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;, for the sake of brevity) seeking\n\nfor setting aside of the said award.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.   The respondent herein on entering appearance in\n\nthe said suit filed an application under Order VII Rule\n\n11(a) &amp; (d) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_7\">of CPC</a> seeking dismissal of A.S.No.68/2010\n\non the ground that it was not maintainable before the\n\nCity Civil Court at Bengaluru.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.   By the impugned order dated 04.01.2018, the City\n\nCivil Court at Bengaluru has allowed the said application\n\nand rejected A.S.No.68/2010 filed by the appellant\n\nherein. Being aggrieved by the said order, plaintiff has\n\npreferred this appeal.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.   We have heard Sri Ravi B.Naik, learned Senior\n\nCounsel appearing for the appellant and Sri Aditya\n\nSondhi,   learned     Senior   Counsel   appearing   for   the\n\nrespondent through video conference and perused the\n\nmaterial on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">7.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant\n\ncontended that the crucial question that arises for\n\nconsideration in this case is, as to, whether, despite\n\nthere being a clause in the contract between the parties\n\nwith regard to governing law and seat of arbitration,\n\nquestion would still arise as to whether the Indian law is\n\nexpressly or impliedly excluded.         He submitted that\n\nthough there is an express clause in the contract stating\n\nthat the governing law of the contract shall be the law of\n\nSingapore, nevertheless, there is no express or implied\n\nexclusion of Indian law.       Therefore, the appellant was\n\njustified in filing A.S.No.68/2010 under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> of the\n\nAct before the City Civil Court at Bengaluru and the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                             7</span>\n\n\n\nCourt ought to have rejected the application filed by the\n\nrespondent under Order VII Rule 11 (a) &amp; (d) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_9\">of CPC</a> and\n\nadjudicated the suit on merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"6993639\" id=\"span_5\">8.   Per contra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nthe respondent emphasized on the words in the clause\n\npertaining to governing law and seat of arbitration in the\n\ncontract and also brought to our notice a judgment of\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/6993639/\" id=\"a_10\">Eitzen Bulk\n\nA/S Vs. Ashapura Minechem Limited and another</a> -\n\n(2016) 11 SC 508.         He submitted that the very\n\nappellant was a party in the aforesaid case and is well\n\naware of the position of law and in the case before the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, the seat of arbitration was\n\nLondon and it was stated that English law would apply.\n\nNevertheless, in the said case, an application was filed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> of the Act before the Civil Court at\n\nJamkhambhalia, Gujarat.      The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n\nheld that such a suit under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 34</a> of the Act was not\n\nmaintainable as <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_13\">Part I of the Act</a> is inapplicable.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                   8</span>\n\n\n\nTherefore, when the appellant herein, who was a party in\n\nthe case before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, was well\n\naware      of   the   position   of   law,   it   could   not    have\n\nmaintained a suit under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a> of the Act before the\n\nCity Civil Court at Bengaluru.         He, therefore, submitted\n\nthat there is no merit in this appeal as the City Civil\n\nCourt at Bengaluru has rightly allowed the application\n\nfiled by the respondent and rejected A.S.No.68/2010\n\nfiled by the appellant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">9.   The aforesaid facts and contentions would not call\n\nfor reiteration, except noticing the clause in the contract\n\nbetween the parties, which is already extracted above,\n\nwherein the clause pertaining to governing law and\n\narbitration categorically states the following:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     i)               the governing law of the contract shall\n                      be the law of Singapore;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     ii)              any   dispute    arising    out     of    or   in\n                      connection with the contract shall be\n                      referred   to   and    finally    resolved     by\n                      arbitration in Singapore;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 9</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      iii)        the said resolution of the dispute by\n                  arbitration   in    Singapore       shall    be    in\n                  accordance with          Arbitration Rules of\n                  Singapore         International         Arbitration\n                  Centre for the time being in force; and\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      iv)         the   said    rules      are   deemed        to   be\n                  incorporated        by    reference         of    the\n                  aforesaid clause.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">10.   Having regard to the aforesaid aspects of the\n\nclause, it is clear that there is an intention expressly\n\nindicated in the clause concerning governing law and\n\narbitration in the instant case. In fact, when there is an\n\nexpress intention forth coming in the clause, it would\n\nthus exclude any other contrary intention. This can be\n\nexpressed by means of a latin maxim, &#x27;expressio unius\n\nest   exclusio   alterius   spres&#x27;,     which    is   a   canon      of\n\nconstruction holding that &#x27;to express or include one thing\n\nimplies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative&#x27;.\n\nIt is thus not necessary to go into the question as to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                             10</span>\n\n\n\nwhether there is any express or implied exclusion in the\n\naforesaid clause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">11.   The clause in the instant case is in fact similar to\n\nthe clause 28 in the contract entered into between the\n\nparties in the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n\n<a href=\"/doc/6993639/\" id=\"a_15\">referred to above</a>, wherein it was stated that the dispute\n\narising between the parties had to be settled by way of\n\narbitration in London and secondly, that English law was\n\nto apply. While considering the said clause, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court has observed and concluded as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      &quot;24.   Thus,   the   main    question   on    which\n  contentions were advanced by the learned counsel\n  for the parties is whether <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_16\">Part I of the Arbitration Act</a>\n  is excluded from its operation in case of a Foreign\n  Award where the Arbitration is not held in India and\n  is governed by foreign law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      26. According to the learned counsel, Clause 28,\n  which is the Arbitration Clause in the Contract,\n  clearly stipulates that any dispute under the Contract\n  &quot;is to be settled and referred to Arbitration in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                            11</span>\n\n\n\nLondon&quot;. It further stipulates that English Law to\napply. The parties have thus clearly intended that\nthe Arbitration will be conducted in accordance with\nEnglish Law and the seat of the Arbitration will be at\nLondon.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">   27.    The   question    is   whether   the   above\nstipulations show the intention of the parties to\nexpressly or impliedly exclude the provisions of Part\nI to the Arbitration, which was to be held outside\nIndia, i.e., in London. We think that the clause\nevinces such an intention by providing that the\nEnglish Law will apply to the Arbitration. The clause\nexpressly provides that Indian Law or any other law\nwill not apply by positing that English Law will apply.\nThe intention is that English Law will apply to the\nresolution of any dispute arising under the law. This\nmeans that English Law will apply to the conduct of\nthe Arbitration. It must also follow that any objection\nto the conduct of the Arbitration or the Award will\nalso be governed by English Law. Clearly, this\nimplies that the challenge to the Award must be in\naccordance with English Law. There is thus an\nexpress exclusion of the applicability of Part I to the\ninstant Arbitration by Clause 28. In fact, Clause 28\ndeals with not only the seat of Arbitration but also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                            12</span>\n\n\n\nprovides that there shall be two Arbitrators, one\nappointed by the charterers and one by the owners\nand they shall appoint an Umpire, in case there is no\nagreement. In this context, it may be noted that the\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_17\">Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> makes\nno provision for Umpires and the intention is clearly\nto refer to an Umpire contemplated by Section 21 of\nthe English Arbitration Act, 1996. It is thus clear that\nthe intention is that the Arbitration should be\nconducted under the English law, i.e. the English\nArbitration Act, 1996. It may also be noted that\n<a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 67</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_19\">68</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_20\">69</a> of the English Arbitration Act\nprovide for challenge to an Award on grounds stated\ntherein. The intention is thus clearly to exclude the\napplicability of Part I to the instant Arbitration\nproceedings.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">   28. This is a case where two factors exclude the\noperation of <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_21\">Part I of the Arbitration Act</a>. Firstly, the\nseat of Arbitration which is in London and secondly,\nthe clause that English Law will apply. In fact, such a\nsituation has been held to exclude the applicability of\nPart I in a case where a similar clause governed the\nArbitration.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"156247141\" id=\"span_11\">In   <a href=\"/doc/156247141/\" id=\"a_22\">Reliance    Industries   Limited   and\nanother v.

I    shall     deal   with     Mr    Hirst&#x27;s\n   arguments       in   due    course       but,   in   my\n   judgment, they fail to grapple with the\n   central point at issue which is whether or not,\n   by choosing London as the seat of the\n   arbitration, the parties must be taken to have\n   agreed that proceedings on the award should\n   be only those permitted by English law. In\n   my view they must be taken to have so\n   agreed for the reasons given by the Judge.\n   The whole purpose of the balance achieved\n   by the Bermuda form (English arbitration but\n   applying New York law to issues arising under\n   the policy) is that judicial remedies in respect\n   of the award should be those permitted by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                            14</span>\n\n\n\nEnglish law and only those so permitted. Mr\nHirst could not say (and did not say) that\nEnglish     judicial   remedies      for     lack     of\njurisdiction on procedural irregularities under\n<a href=\"/doc/472174/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 67</a> and <a href=\"/doc/159834/\" id=\"a_26\">68</a> of the 1996 Act were not\npermitted; he was reduced to saying that\nNew    York     judicial   remedies        were     also\npermitted. That, however, would be a recipe\nfor litigation and (what is worse) confusion\nwhich cannot have been intended by the\nparties. No doubt New York law has its own\njudicial remedies for want of jurisdiction and\nserious irregularity but it could scarcely be\nsupposed that a party aggrieved by one part\nof an award could proceed in one jurisdiction\nand a party aggrieved by another part of an\naward could proceed in another jurisdiction.\nSimilarly, in the case of a single complaint\nabout an award, it could not be supposed\nthat the aggrieved party could complain in\none jurisdiction and the satisfied party be\nentitled to ask the other jurisdiction to\ndeclare its satisfaction with the award. There\nwould be a serious risk of parties rushing to\nget   the   first   judgment    or   of    conflicting\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                            15</span>\n\n\n\n  decisions which the parties cannot have\n  contemplated.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1144681\" id=\"span_17\">56. The aforesaid observations in <a href=\"/doc/1144681/\" id=\"a_27\">C v. D</a>\nwere subsequently followed by the High Court of\nJustice, Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, Commercial\nCourt (England) in Sulamerica Cia Nacional de\nSeguros SA v. Enesa Engelharia SA -- Enesa. In\nlaying down the same proposition, the High\nCourt    noticed   that   the   issue    in   that   case\ndepended upon the weight to be given to the\nprovision in Condition 12 of the insurance policy\nthat &#x27;the seat of the arbitration shall be London,\nEngland&#x27;. It was observed that this necessarily\ncarried with it the English Court&#x27;s supervisory\njurisdiction over the arbitration process.

This immediately establishes a\nstrong    connection      between       the   arbitration\nagreement itself and the law of England. It is for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                               16</span>\n\n\n\nthis reason that recent authorities have laid\nstress upon the locations of the seat of the\narbitration as an important factor in determining\nthe proper law of the arbitration agreement&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">      57. In our opinion, these observations in\nSulamerica case are fully applicable to the facts\nand circumstances of this case. The conclusion\nreached by the High Court would lead to the\nchaotic situation where the parties would be left\nrushing between India and England for redressal\nof their grievances. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_31\">Part I of\nthe    Arbitration     Act,        1996</a>   (Indian)   are\nnecessarily excluded; being wholly inconsistent\nwith the arbitration agreement which provides\n&#x27;that arbitration agreement shall be governed by\nEnglish    law&#x27;.     Thus     the    remedy    for   the\nrespondent to challenge any award rendered in\nthe arbitration proceedings would lie under the\nrelevant provisions contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_32\">Arbitration\nAct, 1996</a> of England and Wales. Whether or not\nsuch an application would now be entertained\nby the courts in England is not for us to\nexamine, it would have to be examined by the\ncourt of competent jurisdiction in England.&quot;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                             17</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">   29.    We   are   in   agreement   with      the   above\nobservation and in this clause 28 in the present case\nmust be intended to have a similar effect, that is, to\nexclude the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_33\">Part I of the Indian\nArbitration and Conciliation Act</a> since the parties\nhave chosen London as the seat of Arbitration and\nfurther   provided   that   the   Arbitration    shall   be\ngoverned by English Law. In this case the losing side\nhas relentlessly resorted to apparent remedies for\nstalling the execution of the Award and in fact even\nattempted to prevent Arbitration. This case has\nbecome typical of cases where even the fruits of\nArbitration are interminably delayed. Even though it\nhas been settled law for quite some time that Part I\nis excluded where parties choose that the seat of\nArbitration is outside India and the Arbitration should\nbe governed by the law of a foreign country.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">                *            *         *\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170570894\" id=\"span_20\">31. When the judgment in Reliance was sought to\nbe indirectly reviewed in another case under the\nsame agreement and between the same parties, this\nCourt reiterated its earlier view and observed in\n<a href=\"/doc/170570894/\" id=\"a_34\">Union of India v.

It is important to note that in para\n32 of Bhatia International itself this Court has\nheld that <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_35\">Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996</a>\nwill not apply if it has been excluded either\nexpressly     or   by    necessary      implication.\nSeveral judgments of this Court have held\nthat   Part   I    is   excluded   by    necessary\nimplication if it is found that on the facts of a\ncase either the juridical seat of the arbitration\nis outside India or the law governing the\narbitration agreement is a law other than\nIndian law.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169405928\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"156247141\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"618892\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"563448\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_26\">This is now well settled by a\nseries of decisions of this Court [see <a href=\"/doc/1045460/\" id=\"a_36\">Videocon\nIndustries Ltd. v.

We are thus of the view that by Clause 28,\nthe parties chose to exclude the application of Part I\nto the arbitration proceedings between them by\nchoosing London as the venue for arbitration and by\nmaking    English     law   applicable    to    arbitration   as\nobserved earlier.      It is too well settled by now that\nwhere the parties choose a juridical seat of arbitration\noutside India and provide that the law which governs\narbitration will be a law other than Indian law, <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_41\">Part I\nof the Act</a> would not have any application and,\ntherefore, the award debtor would not be entitled to\nchallenge the award by raising objections under\n<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 34</a> before a court in India, A court in India\ncould    not   have    jurisdiction      to    entertain   such\nobjections under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 34</a> in such case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">   34. As a matter of fact the mere choosing of the\njuridical seat of Arbitration attracts the law applicable\nto such location. In other words it would not be\nnecessary to specify which law would apply to the\narbitration proceedings, since the law of the particular\ncountry would apply ipso jure. The following passage\nfrom Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration\ncontains the following explication of the issue:-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                             20</span>\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;It is also sometimes said that parties\nhave selected the procedural law that will\ngovern their arbitration, by providing for\narbitration in a particular country. This is too\nelliptical and, as an English court itself held\nmore recently in Breas of Doune Wind Farm it\ndoes not always hold true. What the parties\nhave done is to choose a place of arbitration\nin a particular country. That choice brings\nwith it submission to the laws of that country,\nincluding any mandatory provisions of its law\non arbitration. To say that the parties have\n&quot;chosen&quot; that particular law to govern the\narbitration is rather like saying that an\nEnglish woman who takes her car to France\nhas &quot;chosen&#x27; French traffic law, which will\noblige her to drive on the right-hand side of\nthe   road,     to   give    priority    to    vehicles\napproaching from the right, and generally to\nobey traffic laws to which she may not be\naccustomed. But it would be an odd use of\nlanguage to say this notional motorist had\nopted for &#x27;French traffic law&#x27;. What she has\ndone is to choose to go to France. The\napplicability   of   French      law    then    follows\nautomatically. It is not a matter of choice.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                             21</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">          Parties may well choose a particular\n   place of arbitration precisely because its lex\n   arbitri is one which they find attractive.\n   Nevertheless, once a place of arbitration has\n   been chosen, it brings with it its own law. If\n   that   law   contains     provisions      that   are\n   mandatory     so   far        as   arbitration   are\n   concerned, those provisions must be obeyed.\n   It is not a matter of choice any more than the\n   notional motorist is free to choose which local\n   traffic laws to obey and which to disregard.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">  35. In this view of the matter, the judgment of\nthe Gujarat High Court holding that Ashapura&#x27;s\nobjections under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act are\ntenable before a Court in India, that is, the Court at\nJamKhambalia, Gujarat is contrary to law. The\nproceedings under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 34</a>, which occurs in Part I,\nare liable to be dismissed as untenable. The civil\nappeals of Eitzen are liable to succeed and are,\ntherefore, allowed. The judgment of the Bombay\nHigh Court dated 03.12.2015 enforcing the Foreign\naward under <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_46\">Part II of the Arbitration Act</a> is correct\nand liable to be upheld.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                22</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">12.   Therefore, placing reliance on and draw sustenance\n\nfrom the aforesaid reasoning of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt, we hold that the clause in the instant case\n\ngoverning law and arbitration is similar to the clause in\n\nthe aforesaid decision. We thus hold that in the instant\n\ncase, the governing law of the contract being the law of\n\nSingapore, any challenge to be made to the arbitral\n\naward,   which   was        made    in   accordance   with   the\n\narbitration   rules    of     the    Singapore   International\n\nArbitration Centre applying the law of Singapore, would\n\nhave to be in accordance with the applicable law i.e., the\n\nLaw of Singapore.           Therefore, A.S.No.68/2010 filed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 34</a> of the Act was not maintainable.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">13.
