According    to        the    case     set     up    by     the\n\nUnion/Workmen,    the        Steel      Authority        of    India\n\nLtd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;SAIL&quot;) has\n\nowned a captive Lime Stone and Dolomite Mine\n\nat   Kuteshwar         in         District-Katni,             Madhya\n\nPradesh.     Agreement            dated     27.10.1970           and\n\n5.7.1989 have been relied upon providing that\n\nthe industry shall not employ labour through\n\ncontractor   or   engage          contractor&#x27;s       labour       on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    4</span>\n\n\n\n\njobs    of   permanent           and     perennial     nature.\n\nAgreement of 1989 also provided for abolition\n\nof     contract     labour.            Approximately        5,000\n\nlabourers    had    been       employed    by   the    SAIL    in\n\nviolation of the agreement from May,1979 at\n\nKuteshwar and they were not paid similar wages\n\nas regular workers for similar work violating\n\nthe statutory right of the workers under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_1\">Mines     Act      and         Under      Contract      Labour\n\n(Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970</a> (in short\n\n&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_2\">CLRA Act</a>&quot;). Labourers were working in captive\n\nmine of Lime Stone &amp; Dolomite.                  Management of\n\nKuteshwar Lime Stone exercises the supervisory\n\npower    over      the        workers     employed     by     the\n\ncontractors. They had the right to reject the\n\nproduct. Management used to issue directions\n\nwith    reference        to     disciplinary      action      and\n\nwork. The attendance used to be marked by the\n\nemployees of SAIL. The wages of the workers\n\nwere paid by the SAIL. The contractors were\n\nmere commission agents and contract itself was\n\nsham and bogus. The work was of perennial and\n\npermanent nature.             The workers were infact and\n\nin law the workers of SAIL.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.     The     workers          also       claimed     for     their\n\nregularization           and     for       payment    of     similar\n\nwages. As the Management failed to regularize\n\nthe workers, Union took up the matter with the\n\nLabour Department. Labour Department referred\n\nthe    matter      to     the    Contract        Labour     Advisory\n\nBoard.       The Board recommended prohibition of\n\ncontract        labour.          The       Central      Government\n\nthereafter         vide    notification            dated     17.3.93\n\nprohibited the employment of contract labour\n\nin respect of raising of minerals including\n\nbreaking       sizing,          sorting       of     lime     stone,\n\ndolomite and transportation of lime stone and\n\ndolomite which includes loading and unloading\n\nfrom         Trucks,           dumpers,          conveyors       and\n\ntransportation from mine site to the Factory.\n\nThe contractors&#x27; labour were doing the same\n\nwork prohibited under the notification dated\n\n17.3.1993.         They did the work till April,1996\n\nwhen all of a sudden they were stopped from\n\nentering      the       work    place      and     prevented    from\n\ndoing their duties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.     All the workers have completed 240 days\n\nservice       in    a     calendar         year.     They    claimed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         6</span>\n\n\n\n\nreinstatement with full back wages, interest\n\nand   compensation           along      with       other        reliefs.\n\nAction      of   the    Management              amounts    to        unfair\n\nlabour      practice.          During            pendency           of     the\n\ndisputes,        several     workers            died.     It    is        also\n\nsubmitted that 2040 workers filed their cases\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_3\">Minimum Wages Act</a> in which High Court\n\ndirected to pay the Minimum Wages.                         The action\n\nof the Management in terminating the services\n\nwas illegal, unfair and unjustified.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.    The        Management          contended             that           the\n\nreference        is    bad   due     to     non-application                 of\n\nmind, the Union should produce certificate of\n\nits    registration           to        establish          its           true\n\nidentity.        The    SAIL       is       a     Govt.        of        India\n\nundertaking.          SAIL has one of the captive Lime\n\nStone &amp; Dolomite Mine at Kuteshwar, District-\n\nKatni, Madhya Pradesh. Certain wage agreements\n\nwere entered into at the level of NJCS where\n\nrepresentative          of    main      steel       producers             and\n\ntheir Unions representing their workman were\n\nthe   parties.           Agreement              dated     27.10.1970,\n\n5.7.1989, 18.5.1995 were entered into.

It   is    further    contended          that    the   Chief\n\nLabour      Commissioner           (C)         has     exclusive\n\njurisdiction under the provision of Rule 25(2)\n\nof    Contract    Labour        (Regulation      &amp;     Abolition)\n\nCentral Rules, 1971 (hereinafter referred to\n\nas &quot;CLRA Rules&quot;) to decide whether the type of\n\nwork performed is similar.                It has also been\n\ndenied that contract labour performed the same\n\nwork as the regular workers. The dispute as to\n\nthe    wages     being     paid     has       been     separately\n\nagitated under the <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_4\">Minimum Wages Act</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.    It is further contended that there is no\n\nviolation       of     rights      of     contract       labour.\n\nManagement        ensured        that     the         contractors\n\ncomplied with the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_5\">CLRA Act</a>. The\n\ncontractors       were     to    produce       lime     stone   of\n\nspecified grades and size at specified rates\n\nof    production.      Penalties        were    also     provided\n\nfor deviation in the contract. Management of\n\nthe Kuteshwar Lime Stone Mine inspected and\n\nensured that lime stone of agreed grade and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                          8</span>\n\n\n\n\nsize were being sent to the Steel Plants as it\n\nwas provided under the <a href=\"/doc/1814464/\" id=\"a_6\">Mines Act</a>. However, it\n\nhas been denied that Management was exercising\n\npower      of         supervision              or         disciplinary\n\nauthority.       The        contractors             supervised         and\n\ncontrolled the labourers for all purposes.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">8.     It is not disputed that SAIL did blasting\n\nwork as per notification dated 15.12.1979 with\n\neffect from 22.6.1980. It is true that many of\n\nthe activities of the mines have been going\n\nfor long periods. Contractors were engaged for\n\ndoing     mining        activities             through           contract\n\nlabours     where       it         was        difficult          to    use\n\nmachineries. It was done by inviting tenders.\n\nThe     notification         dated           17.3.93      was      issued\n\nwithout     proper          application             of    mind        under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1442514/\" id=\"a_7\">Section     10(2)</a>       of     the           CLRA        Act     by    the\n\nGovernment        and        the     Committee                 especially\n\nconstituted       for        the     purpose.            The      Central\n\nGovernment       is    not    an     appropriate               Government\n\nwith     respect       to     transportation                on     public\n\nroads.     M/s    Eastern          Mineral          Trading        Agency\n\nworking     at     Kuteshwar             filed       writ        petition\n\nbefore the Calcutta High Court where interim\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                      9</span>\n\n\n\n\norder was passed.             Contractors abandoned the\n\nwork in 1997. The writ petition was dismissed\n\non     1.4.1998    and        the        stay     was       vacated.\n\nHowever, some other contractors had also filed\n\nwrit     before         the        Calcutta          High       Court\n\nchallenging       notification            dated        17.3.93    in\n\nwhich    order    was     passed         in     the     year     1994\n\nrestraining       the     respondents           including        the\n\nUnion of India and SAIL from giving effect to\n\nthe said notification. Said interim order is\n\nstill in force. Services of contract labourers\n\nwere terminated by the contractors sometime in\n\nMarch,1996.       There       was     no      relationship         of\n\nmaster and servant between the management of\n\nSAIL and the contract labourers.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">9.     The CGIT framed as many as seven issues\n\nand    has   passed      Award      dated       16th    September,\n\n2009. The Tribunal has held that the contract\n\nof Principal Employer with the Contractors in\n\nregard       to    the        contract          labour          after\n\nnotification      dated       17.3.93         became     sham    and\n\nbogus.        However,        at    the       same      time,     the\n\nTribunal also recorded a finding that before\n\nthe date of the said notification contract was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       10</span>\n\n\n\n\nnot    sham    and    bogus.     The       Tribunal      also    held\n\nthat    remedy       of   the    workers          is   confined    to\n\npenal provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/790314/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 23</a> to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/539839/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 25</a> of CLRA Act. Question of grant of\n\nterminal benefits does not arise.                      The workers\n\nwere not the employees of SAIL Management, no\n\nabsorption       process        of   contract          labour    took\n\nplace.       Contract labours were not employees of\n\nSAIL as such they were not entitled for wages\n\nas per agreement.

The action of\n\nthe respondent in throwing out the workers is\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act.\n\nThe       contracts         prior         to       prohibition\n\nnotification and subsequent thereto were sham\n\nand bogus.         The workers have to be treated as\n\nemployees of the Management.                The witnesses of\n\nthe    Management        fall    short      of    proving      the\n\ndocuments, they were not having any personal\n\nknowledge.         The workers are poor, illiterate\n\nand tribal, they are out of employment for the\n\nlast so many years, still they have adduced\n\nsufficient      evidence.       Adverse     inference       ought\n\nto have been drawn by the CGIT due to non-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   13</span>\n\n\n\n\nexamination        of     material          witnesses.         The\n\nrelevant    record,       inspite      of     the    directions\n\nissued by the CGIT, have not been produced by\n\nthe Management.           The alleged contract after\n\nissue of notification under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 10</a> of CLRA\n\nAct was wholly unjustified.                   Contract itself\n\nis prohibited and what is unauthorized in law\n\nis   sham   and    bogus.        Since      the     contract    is\n\nprohibited,       it    cannot   be     genuine      under      any\n\ncircumstances. In the prohibition notification\n\nissued under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 10</a> of CLRA Act by Govt.\n\nof India various factors have been taken into\n\nconsideration.          The work is carried on in the\n\npremises    of    SAIL.    Inspite       of    the      fact   that\n\nTribunal held that contract after prohibition\n\nnotification was sham and bogus, has failed to\n\ngive    appropriate         relief       to       the     workers\n\nemployed by the contractors. They infact were\n\nthe employees of the Management.                  The Tribunal\n\nhas failed to appreciate the correct position\n\nof law, the conclusions drawn from the facts\n\non record are not legally sustainable.                          The\n\nfinding recorded that there was no master and\n\nservant      relationship          is         perverse.

The contracts cannot be said to be\n\nsham and bogus.           Question with respect to the\n\ncontract being sham and bogus is essentially\n\nan issue of fact. In case provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_19\">CLRA\n\nAct</a>    are   violated       by   employing           the    contract\n\nlabours      after     17.3.93,        the        only    remedy     is\n\nprovided      under    Section        VI     of    CLRA     Act.    The\n\nwork being of perennial nature will not ipso\n\nfacto make the contract sham and bogus.                            The\n\nnotification is illegal because of gross non-\n\ncompliance of <a href=\"/doc/1442514/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 10(2)</a> of CLRA Act.

If we may say so, the eloquence of\n    the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_33\">CLRA Act</a>    in not spelling out the\n    consequence of abolition of contract\n    labour system, discerned in the light of\n    various reports of the Commissions and\n    the Committees and the    Statement    of\n    Objects and Reasons of the Act, appears\n    to be that the Parliament intended to\n    create a bar on engaging contract labour\n    in the    establishment covered by the\n    prohibition notification, by a principal\n    employer so as to leave no option with\n    him except to employ the workers as\n    regular employees directly. <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 10</a>\n    is intended to work as a permanent\n    solution to the problem rather than to\n    provide   a   one    time    measure   by\n    departmentalizing the existing contract\n    labour   who   may,   by   a   fortuitous\n    circumstance be in a given establishment\n    for a very short time as on the date of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                              19</span>\n\n\n\n\n    the prohibition notification.

In such a case\n    there could be no justification to\n    prefer the contract labour engaged on\n    the relevant date over the contract\n    labour   employed   for  longer    period\n    earlier. These may be some of the\n    reasons as to why no specific provision\n    is made for automatic absorption of\n    contract labour in the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_35\">CLRA Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_23\">The Apex Court has further <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_36\">laid down in</a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_37\">Steel Authority of India Ltd. and others vs.\n\nNational      Union     Waterfront     Workers   and\n\nothers</a>(supra)    that    there    is   no   automatic\n\nabsorption , where the contract was found to\n\nbe a sham and nominal, rather a camouflage, in\n\nwhich case the contract labour working in the\n\nestablishment of the principal employer were\n\nheld, in fact and in reality, the employees of\n\nthe principal employer himself.

In Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive\n      Works Ltd. etc. (1947) 1 DLR 161 at\n      p.1969 Lord Wright    said       that    a\n      single test, such as the presence or\n      absence of control, was often relied on\n      to determine whether the     case was one\n      of master and servant, mostly in order\n      to decide issues of tortious liability\n      on the part of the master or superior\n      and    that in the       more    complex\n      conditions of modern industry , more\n      complicated tests     have often to be\n      applied. He said that it would be\n      more   appropriate  to apply, a complex\n      test involving      (i)    control;   (ii)\n      ownership of the tools; (iii) chance\n      of profit; (iv) risk of loss, and that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                      31</span>\n\n\n\n\ncontrol   in   itself  is   not   always\nconclusive.   He further said that in\nmany cases    the question can only be\nsettled by examining the whole of the\nvarious   elements which constitute the\nrelationship between the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">23. In U.S. v. Silk 331 US 704 the\nquestion was whether men working for\nthe plaintiffs, Silk and Greyvan, were\n&quot;employees&quot; within the meaning of that\nword in the Social Security Act, 1935.\nThe    judges of the Supreme Court of\nU.S.A., agreed upon     the test    to be\napplied, though not in every instance\nupon its application       to the facts.\nThey said that the test was      not &quot;the\ncommon    law test,&quot; viz., &quot;power       of\ncontrol,     whether exercised    or not,\nover the manner of performing service\nto the     undertaking,&quot; but whether the\nmen were employees &quot;as       a matter of\neconomic reality.&quot; Important factors\nwere said       to be &quot;the degrees of\ncontrol, opportunities of profit or\nloss,     investment    in     facilities,\npermanency of relations and          skill\nrequired in the claimed independent\noperation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">31. The further fact that &quot;a worker can\nbe removed&quot; which means nothing    more\nthan that the employer has the liberty\nnot    to give     further work to an\nemployee who has not performed    his\njob   according to the instructions of\nthe employer, or who has been absent\nfrom the shop for a long time as spoken\nto by the Inspector of Labour in his\nevidence, would bespeak of control and\nsupervision    consistent    with   the\ncharacter of the business.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">34.

A person can be a\n      servant of more than one employer. A\n      servant   need   not    be under     the\n      exclusive   control of one master.

Approaching the\nmatter from this angle, the Court\nobserved that the employer&#x27;s right to\nreject the end product if it does not\nconform to the instructions of the\nemployer speaks for the element of\ncontrol and supervision. So also the\nright of removal of the workman or not\nto give the work has the element of\ncontrol and supervision. If these\naspects are considered decisive, they\nare amply satisfied in the facts of\nthis case. The Tribunal ignored the\nwell laid test in law and completely\nmisdirected itself by showing that\npiece-rate      itself      indicates     a\nrelationship of independent contractor\nand error apparent on the record\ndisclosing a total lack of knowledge\nof the method of payment in various\noccupations in different industries.\nThe right of rejection coupled with\nthe   right    to    refuse    work   would\ncertainly    establish      master-servant\nrelationship and both these tests are\namply satisfied in the facts of this\ncase.

The Apex Court has laid down thus :-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       &quot;10. In the context of the     conditions\n       and   the circumstances set out earlier\n       in which the home workers of a single\n       manufacturer     go      about      their\n       work,including the     receiving of raw\n       material, rolling the beedis at home and\n       delivering them to the manufacturer\n       subject to the right Of rejection there\n       is sufficient evidence of the requisite\n       degree of control and supervision for\n       establishing the     relationship      of\n       master and        servant between the\n       manufacturer and the home worker. The\n       work of rolling beedis is not of a\n       sophisticated nature, requiring control\n\n\n       and supervision at the time       when the\n       work is      done. It      is    a simple\n       operation which,as practice has shown,\n       has been performed    satisfactorily by\n       thousands of illiterate workers. It is\n       a task which can be performed by young\n       and old, men and women, with equal\n       facility and it does not require a high\n       order of skill. In the circumstances,the\n       right of rejection can constitute in\n       itself    an     effective    degree    of\n       supervision and control.We may point out\n       that there is evidence to show that the\n       rejection   takes place in the presence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                             35</span>\n\n\n\n\n     of the home worker.         That factor,\n     however, plays a merely supportive role\n     in determining the      existence of the\n     relationship    of master and    servant.\n     The petitioners point out that there is\n     no   element of      personal service in\n     beedi rolling and that it is open to a\n     home worker to get the work done by one\n     or the other member of his family at\n     home. The element of personal service,\n     it   seems   to    us,   is   of   little\n     significance when the test of control\n     and supervision lies in the right of\n     rejection.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"940027\" id=\"span_51\">The Tribunal has considered the decision\n\nof   Apex    Court    in   <a href=\"/doc/940027/\" id=\"a_70\">Workmen     of      Nilgiri\n\nCooperative Marketing Society Ltd.       vs.      State\n\nof Tamil Nadu and others</a> 2004 (101) FLR 137 in\n\nwhich the Apex Court has held thus :-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">        &quot;The    control      test     and    the\n        organization test, therefore, are\n        not the only factors which can be\n        said to decisive.

The   High\n\nCourt    of     Calcutta       on      15.3.94        and    11.4.94\n\nstayed the operation of the said notification.\n\nIn November, 1996 the contract labours of the\n\ncontractor       went     on     illegal           strike.         The\n\ncontractors issued notice to the labours to\n\njoin    their    duties.       As      they    did     not    resume\n\ntheir duties, thus, the contractor terminated\n\nthe     services        of      the         contract        labours.\n\nThereafter      the     labours        were    not     allowed      to\n\nenter the mine&#x27;s premises for safety reasons.\n\nHe     has    admitted         that         various     agreements\n\nprovide for abolition of contract labour.

It is also\n\nstated that B form used to be prepared by the\n\ncontractor which used to be counter signed by\n\nthe Mines Manager who used to retain a copy of\n\nForm B in his custody. Form B of 1500-1600\n\nworkers was prepared. The witness was unable\n\nto say whether they were the claimants in the\n\nreference. He has also admitted that no one\n\ncan work inside the mine without permission of\n\nthe Mines Manager as it is a prohibited area.\n\nHe   was    unable     to    say    that    from   1996    any\n\nunskilled worker was recruited in the mine.\n\nOne copy of wage sheet used to be retained by\n\nthe management. He has also admitted that in\n\ncase Mines Manager felt that presence of any\n\nperson is undesirable in the mine, he could\n\nhave    asked    the     contractor        to   remove     such\n\nperson. The witness was unable to state what\n\nwas the nature of the work in the mine in\n\nquestion which was of permanent and perennial\n\nnature.

Whether the workers had\n\nworked      for    5     years       or        20    years     could   be\n\nascertained        from       Form     B.

He was not able to state\n\nthe names of the contractors. From 17.3.93 to\n\n15.3.94     there       was     no    stay          order.      Physical\n\nsize and chemical quality material used to be\n\nchecked by         the employees of the management.\n\nSome contractors used to be paid in advance\n\nfor making payment of the wages to workers.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">24.

The Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/642607/\" id=\"a_95\">Hussainbhai vs. Alat\n\nFactory</a> AIR 1978 SC 1409 has laid down that\n\nmere     contracts          are     not     decisive.

He   has\n      economic control over the worker&#x27;s\n      subsistence,    skill    and   continued\n      employment.    If he, for any reason,\n      chokes off, the worker is, virtually\n      laid    off.       The    presence      of\n      intermediate contractors with whom\n      alone the workers have immediate or\n      direct relationship ex contractu is\n      of no consequence when, on lifting\n      the    veil   or     looking     at    the\n      conspectus    of    factors    governing\n      employment, we discern the naked\n      truth, though draped in different\n      perfect paper arrangement, that the\n      real employer is the Management, not\n      the   immediate    contractor.

We find\n\nthat      supervision             and          control           was      by\n\nmanagement. The agreements entered into time\n\nto time       prohibited employment of the contract\n\nlabour in perennial and permanent nature of\n\nwork. It has not been disputed that Dolomite &amp;\n\nLime     Stone       are      necessary              ingredients         of\n\nmanufacture of steel and work is perennial and\n\npermanent      in     nature.       It        has     also       not    been\n\ndisputed       that         Government               of     India       has\n\nprohibited the aforesaid work to be taken from\n\n17.3.93 by the contract labour, still it was\n\ntaken    by    the    SAIL        from    the        workers      without\n\nthere    being       any    interim           stay    till       1994   and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                       71</span>\n\n\n\n\nthereafter also till 1996, and still it is not\n\ndisputed at Bar the work is being taken by and\n\nlarge      through          the       contract        labours.The\n\nprohibition notification has not been enforced\n\nfor the reasons best known to the SAIL so far.\n\nIt has failed to satisfy this Court that there\n\nis any interim stay with respect to Koteshwar\n\nMines    obtained          by   any     contractor      which     is\n\noperative as on today. A vague submission has\n\nbeen raised that some of the contractors of\n\nSAIL had obtained interim stay from Calcutta\n\nHigh    Court.      In     case   any      of   the   contractors\n\nfrom     Kuteshwar         Limestone        had    obtained      the\n\nstay, till which date it continued, whether\n\nthe petition is pending, counsel on behalf of\n\nthe     SAIL        was     unable         to   point     it    out\n\nspecifically.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">34.      The    Tribunal        while      deciding     the    issue\n\nwhether the contract is sham and bogus after\n\n17.3.93 has held that the contract is sham and\n\nbogus.     This finding has been recorded by the\n\nTribunal in para 85 of the award.                     The finding\n\nrecorded       by    the    Tribunal        that   same   workers\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                      72</span>\n\n\n\n\ncontinued till 1996 has not been disputed at\n\nBar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">35.     We find admission of Shri T.K.Dhali that\n\nonly    the   incumbents        who       successfully       passed\n\nthe Vocational Training under the Rules were\n\npromoted to work in the mine and there was\n\npower     with        the     management           to     ask     the\n\ncontractor     to      remove    a    worker       as     mentioned\n\nabove.    From    evidence       it       is     clear    that    the\n\namount    used    to    be     paid       in     advance    by   the\n\nmanagement to the contractor for payment to\n\nthe workers. Infact, they were actual masters\n\nto make the payment.             We are conscious of the\n\nfact that no single test can be said to be\n\ndeterminative         factor.        While        recording       the\n\nfinding that only contractor could remove or\n\ntransfer      the           employees,           various        other\n\nprovisions       of    Acts     and        Rules    of     control,\n\nsupervision,      taking       disciplinary          action      were\n\nbeing observed by the management, as admitted\n\nby their witnesses. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1050814\" id=\"span_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"488602\" id=\"span_116\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1462388\" id=\"span_117\">The finding of Tribunal\n\nthat     contractors           had        full     control        and\n\nsupervision over the work is also a perverse\n\nfinding.         In    view     of        the    Scheme    of    the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                      73</span>\n\n\n\n\nfunctioning of the mines, the total control\n\nand    supervision       was    that      of     management     and\n\nwithout      their     permission,        workers       could   not\n\nhave entered into the mine itself and even if\n\nhe was found at wrong place, his removal could\n\nhave    been    ordered       from    the      mine    itself   and\n\nsuch    an   incumbent        against       whom      disciplinary\n\naction is taken by the management could not\n\nhave    been    re-employed          by   the     contractor     as\n\nprovided in the terms of the contract. It is\n\nalso a perverse finding that contractor has\n\nfull control over the skilled and professional\n\nwork, infact the entire work was done under\n\nstrict       supervision        and         control       of    the\n\nmanagement       as     apparent          from      the    various\n\nprovisions quoted above which were observed by\n\nmanagement.

It is\nalso pertinent to note that nothing\nwas brought on record to            indicate\nthat even the Board at the relevant\ntime,was registered           as principal\nemployer under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_161\">Contract           Labour\nRegulation and         Abolition        Act</a>.\nOnce the Board was not a principal\nemployer        and       the    so   called\ncontractor      Kashmir Singh            was\nnot a licensed contractor under the\nAct,   the     inevitable         conclusion\n     that    had to be reached was        to\nthe effect that         the     so    called\ncontract system was a          mere\ncamouflage,     smoke    and a screen and\ndisguised in       almost    a transparent\nveil which could easily be pierced\nand       the        real        contractual\nrelationship      between the Board, on\nthe one hand,         and the employees,\non   the    other,    could     be   clearly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                     80</span>\n\n\n\n\n       visualised.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">38.

Tribunal on 5.6.06 and\n\n22.8.06     held       that     management           cannot     be\n\ninsisted to produce those documents which are\n\nnot in their possession.

There is yet another important facet in\n\nthe case due to which the workers are entitled\n\nfor relief of reinstatement, even assuming for\n\nthe time being that contract was not sham and\n\nbogus, however, fact remains that prohibition\n\nnotification      to    employ        the    contract     workers\n\ncame into force with effect from 17.3.93.
