III of the Act, and that\t any\naward  directing  the  abolition of  contract  labour  would\ncontravene  the\t appellant&#x27;s fundamental right to  carry  on\nbusiness  under\t <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_5\">Art.  19(1)(g)</a> of  the\t Constitution.\t The\nIndustrial  Court  decided that the Industrial\tCourt  would\nhave  jurisdiction as the matter was covered by item (2)  of\nSch.  11 of the Act and that there was no  contravention  of\nthe  fundamental  rights of the appellants.  On\t appeal\t the\nLabour\tAppellate Tribunal, held, that the Industrial  Court\nhad  jurisdiction to decide the matter although it  was\t not\ncovered\t by item (2) of Sch. 11 of the Act.  As regards\t the\nquestion  of contravention of the fundamental right it\theld\nthat  the  question  whether  the  restriction\timposed\t was\nreasonable  depended  upon the facts of each  case  and\t the\nmatter\twas  outside  the  powers  of  a  court\t of  appeal.\nEventually it set aside the entire award on the merits.\t  On\nappeal &#x27;by the appellant by special leave,\nHeld,  that  the Industrial Court had jurisdiction  to\tdeal\nwith the matter.\nWhatever might be the ambit of the word &quot;employment&quot; used in\nitem  (6) of Sch.  III, if a matter was covered by Sch.\t  11\nit  could only be referred to the Industrial Court under  s.\n73A.   A  question  relating to the  abolition\tof  contract\nlabour\tinevitably  raised  a dispute  relating\t to  matters\ncontained in items (2), (9) and (10)\tof Sch.\t 11, namely,\npermanent increase in the number of\n343\npersons\t employed, the employees&#x27; wages, hours of  work\t and\nrest intervals and could, therefore, be referred only to  an\nIndustrial Court.\nThe  power given to the Industrial Court which was a  quasi-\njudicial  tribunal to decide whether contract labour  should\nbe    abolished\t or not would  not  make  the  definition of\n&quot;industrial  &quot; matter&quot; in so far as it referred to the\tmode\nof   employment\t an  S.\t unreasonable  restriction  on\t the\nfundamental right of the employer to carry on his trade\t and\nas such there was no contravention of his fundamental  right\nby  providing  in  <a href=\"/doc/89011103/\" id=\"a_6\">S.  3(18)</a>  that  an\t&quot;industrial  matter&quot;\nincluded also the mode of employment of the employees.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 352 of 1958.\nAppeal\tby special leave from the judgment and\torder  dated\nJuly  27, 1956, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal  of  India,\nBombay, in Appeal (Bom.)

The Judgment of the Court was delivered\nby\nWANCHOO,  J.-This  is  an  appeal by  special  leave  in  an\nindustrial  matter.   The appellant owns  two  sugar  mills.\nThere  was a dispute between the appellant and\tits  workmen\nwith respect to the employment of contract labour in the two\nmills.\tConsequently, a notice of change under<a href=\"/doc/120788890/\" id=\"a_7\"> S. 42 (2)</a>  of\nthe  Bombay  Industrial\t Relations  Act,  No.  XI  of  1947,\n(hereinafter  called the Act) was given to the appellant  by\nthe union re. presenting the workmen.  Thereafter the union,\nwhich  is  the respondent in the present  appeal,  made\t two\nreferences to the industrial court, one with respect to each\nmill,  under<a href=\"/doc/42676023/\" id=\"a_8\"> s. 73A</a> of the Act, and the main demand  in\t the\nreferences  was that &quot;the system of  employing\tcontractors&#x27;\nlabour should be abolished and the strength of the employees\nof   the  respective  departments  should   be\t permanently\nincreased sufficiently\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">344</span>\nand accordingly&quot;.  The appellant raised two main contentions\nbefore the industrial court, namely, (i) that the industrial\ncourt  had  no\tjurisdiction to decide the  dispute  as\t the\nmatter\twas  covered by item (6) of Sch.   III\tof  the Act,\nwhich  is  within  the exclusive jurisdiction  of  a  labour\ncourt;\tand  (ii)  that any  award  directing  abolition  of\ncontract  labour would contravene the fundamental  right  of\nthe  appellant to carry on business under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_9\">Art.\t19(1)(g)</a>  of\nthe Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">The  industrial\t court decided both the points\tagainst\t the\nappellant; on the question of jurisdiction it held that\t the\nmatter\twas  covered by item (2) of Sch. 11 of the  Act\t and\ntherefore the industrial court would have jurisdiction,\t and\non the second point it held that there was no  contravention\nof  the fundamental right conferred on the  appellant  under\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_10\">Art.  19(1)(g).</a>\t It may be mentioned that the  second  point\narose  on the stand taken by the appellant that the  workmen\nof  the contractors were not the workmen of  the  appellant.\nThe industrial court then dealt with the merits of the\tcase\nand  passed  certain orders, with which we are\thowever\t not\nconcerned in the present appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">It  may\t be mentioned that there were cases  relating  to  a\nnumber of other sugar mills raising the same points, which\nwere  decided at the same time by the industrial court.\t  In\nconsequence,  there were a number of appeals to\t the  Labour\nAppellate Tribunal by the mills and one by one of the unions\n(though\t not  by the respondent-union).\t All  these  appeals\nwere  heard together by the appellate tribunal,\t where\talso\nthe  same  two points relating to jurisdiction\tand  contra-\nvention of the fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_11\">Art. 19(1)(g)</a>\nwere raised.  The Appellate Tribunal did not agree with\t the\nindustrial  court that the references were covered  by\titem\n(2) of Sch. 11 to the Act.  It, however, held that the\tword\n&quot;employment&quot;  in item (6) of Sch.  III to the Act had to  be\ngiven  a restricted meaning.  It pointed out that the  three\nSchedules did not exhaust the comprehensive provisions of<a href=\"/doc/120788890/\" id=\"a_12\"> s.\n42(2)</a>  and  the\t subject-matter\t of  dispute,  namely,\t the\nabolition of contract labour was a question of far  reaching\nand important change which could not have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">345</span>\nbeen intended to be dealt with in a summary way by a  labour\ncourt,\twhich  is  the lowest in  the  hierarchy  of  courts\nestablished  under  the\t Act.  It therefore  held  that\t the\nindustrial court had jurisdiction to decide the matter.\t  On\nthe question of contravention of the, fundamental right, the\nappellate  tribunal took the view that the question  whether\nthe  restriction  imposed was reasonable depended  upon\t the\nfacts  of each case and therefore was a matter\toutside\t its\npower as a court of appeal It then considered the merits  of\nthe  matter and came to the conclusion that the approach  of\nthe  industrial court to the questions raised before it\t was\nnot  correct and therefore it found it difficult to  support\nthe  award.  Eventually it set aside the award and  remanded\nthe   matter  for  early  hearing  in  the  light   of\t the\nobservations  made by it.  Further, it decided that  in\t the\ninterest  of justice the entire award should be\t set  aside,\neven  though there was no appeal before it by the unions  in\nmost  of the cases.  The appellant then came to\t this  Court\nand  was granted special leave; and that is how\t the  matter\nhas come up before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">Mr.  Pathak on behalf of the appellant has raised  the\tsame\ntwo points before us.  We shall first deal with the question\nof  jurisdiction.  Reliance in this connection is placed  on\nitem (6) of Sch.  III of the Act, which is in these terms:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;Employment including-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)  reinstatement and recruitment;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(ii) unemployment  of  persons previously  employed  in\t the\nindustry concerned.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">It is not in dispute that matters contained in Sch.  III are\nwithin the jurisdiction of a labour court and an  industrial\ncourt  has  no\tjurisdiction  to  decide  any  matter  in  a\nreference  under  s.  73<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_13\">A of the Act</a>  which  is\t within\t the\njurisdiction  of a labour court.  Mr. Pathak  contends\tthat\nitem (6) of Sch.  III speaks of &quot;employment&quot; and includes in\nit  two matters which might otherwise not have been  thought\nto  be\tincluded  in  it.   Therefore,\taccording  to\thim,\nemployment as used in item (6) is wider than the two matters\nincluded in it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">44</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">346</span>\nand the question whether contract labour should be  employed\nor not would be a matter of employment within the meaning of\nthat  word  in\titem (6) of Sch. 111.  We do  not  think  it\nnecessary for purposes of this appeal to consider what would\nbe the ambit of employment as used in item (6) of Sch.\t111.\nThe  scheme  of the Act shows that under<a href=\"/doc/38989607/\" id=\"a_14\"> ss. 71</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/107935343/\" id=\"a_15\">72</a>\t the\njurisdiction  of a labour court and an industrial  court  is\nconcurrent  with  respect  to any matters  which  the  State\nGovernment  may deem fit to refer to them; but under<a href=\"/doc/42676023/\" id=\"a_16\"> s.\t 73A</a>\nreference by a registered union which is a representative of\nemployees  and which is also an approved union, can only  be\nmade to an industrial court, subject to the proviso that  no\nsuch  dispute can be referred to an industrial\tcourt  where\nunder  the  provisions\tof  the Act it\tis  required  to  be\nreferred  to the labour court for its decision.\t <a href=\"/doc/120924328/\" id=\"a_17\">Sec. 78</a>  of\nthe  Act  provides  for jurisdiction of\t labour\t courts\t and\nmatters specified in Sch.  11 are not within their  ordinary\njurisdiction.  Therefore, when a registered union wishes  to\nrefer  any matter which is contained in Sch.  11 of the\t Act\nsuch  reference\t can be made by it only\t to  the  industrial\ncourt.\t It follows in consequence that whatever may be\t the\nambit  of  the word &quot;employment&quot; used in item  (6)  of\tSch.\nIII,  if  any matter is covered by Sch. 11 it  can  only  be\nreferred  to  the industrial court under<a href=\"/doc/42676023/\" id=\"a_18\"> s.  73A</a>.   Now\t the\nquestion whether contract labour should be abolished (on the\nassumption that contract labour is not in the employ of\t the\nmills)\timmediately raises questions relating  to  permanent\nincrease  in  the number of persons  employed,\ttheir  wages\nincluding the period and mode of payment, hours of work\t and\nrest  intervals, which are items (2), (9) and (10)  of\tSch.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">11.  Therefore, a question relating to abolition of contract\nlabour\tis  so inextricably mixed up with  the\tquestion  of\npermanent increase in the number of persons employed,  their\nwages,\thours  of work and rest intervals that\tany  dispute\nrelating to contract labour would inevitably raise questions\ncovered\t by  Sch.  11.\tTherefore,  a  dispute\trelating  to\ncontract  labour if it is to be referred under<a href=\"/doc/42676023/\" id=\"a_19\"> s. 73A</a>  by  a\nregistered union can only be referred to an industrial court\nas it immediately\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">347</span>\nraises matters contained in items (2), (9) and (10) of\tSch.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">11.   Mr.  Pathak  urges however that  matters\trelating  to\npermanent increase in the number of persons employed due  to\nthe abolition of contract labour, their wages, hours of work\nand  rest intervals were not really disputed at all  by\t the\nappellant.  It appears that in the written-statements of the\nappellant, these points were not raised; but the decision of\nthe  appellate\ttribunal shows that one of  the\t contentions\nraised\tbefore\tit by the sugar-mills was that\tthe  workmen\nconcerned were not employees of the sugar mills.  Therefore,\nas  soon  as  this  contention is raised  a  dispute  as  to\npermanent increase in the number of persons employed,  their\nwages,\thours of work and rest intervals  would\t immediately\narise.\t It must therefore be held that a question  relating\nto  the\t abolition of contract labour  inevitably  raises  a\ndispute with respect to these three items contained in\tSch.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">11.   In  the  circumstances  we are  of  opinion  that\t the\nindustrial  court had jurisdiction to deal with the  matter.\nIn particular, we may point out that in their petitions\t the\nunions had raised at least the question as to the  permanent\nincrease  in the number of persons employed and\t that  would\nimmediately  bring in item (2) of Sch.\t11. It is true\tthat\nthe question of permanent increase in the number of  persons\nemployed,  their  wages, hours of work\tand  rest  intervals\nwould only arise if contract labour is to be abolished;\t but\nin  our opinion these are matters so inextricably  mixed  up\nwith  the question relating to abolition of contract  labour\nthat they must be held to be in dispute as soon as the\tdis-\npute  is  raised  about the abolition  of  contract  labour,\n(assuming always that the employer does not accept  contract\nlabour\tas part of its labour force).  The contention  about\njurisdiction must therefore be rejected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">This  brings  us  to the second\t contention  raised  by\t Mr.\nPathak.\t  He bases his argument in this behalf on<a href=\"/doc/89011103/\" id=\"a_20\"> s.  3(18)</a>,\nwhich defines an &quot; industrial matter &quot; as meaning any matter\nrelating   to  employment,  work,  wages,  hours  of   work,\nprivileges,  rights or duties of employers or employees,  or\nthe mode, terms and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">348</span>\nconditions  of\temployment.   Mr.  Pathak  urges  that\t the\ndefinition   of\t &quot;  industrial\tmatter\t&quot;  contravenes\t the\nfundamental  right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_21\">Art. 19(1)(g)</a>,  when  it\nprovides that the mode of employment is also included within\nit.   Reference\t is also made to<a href=\"/doc/71970043/\" id=\"a_22\"> s. 3(17)</a> which\t defines  an\n&quot;industrial  dispute&quot; as any dispute or difference which  is\nconnected with any industrial matter.  Mr. Pathak  therefore\nurges\tthat  reading  the  two\t definitions  together\t the\nindustrial court is given the power to decide disputes as to\nthe mode of employment and that contravenes the\t fundamental\nright  guaranteed  under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_23\">Art. 19(1)(g)</a>, for  it\t enables  an\nindustrial court to adjudicate on the mode of employment and\nthus  interfere with the right of the employer to  carry  on\nhis  trade as he likes subject to  reasonable  restrictions.\nNow  assuming that the mode of employment used in  s.  3(18)\nincludes such questions as abolition of contract labour, the\nquestion would still be whether a provision which enables an\nindustrial court to adjudicate on the question whether\tcon-\ntract  labour  should  or  should not  be  abolished  is  an\nunreasonable restriction on the employer&#x27;s right to carry on\nhis  trade.  We cannot see how the fact that power is  given\nto the industrial court, which is a quasi-judicial  tribunal\nto decide whether contract labour should be abolished or not\nwould  make the definition of &quot;industrial matter&quot; in so\t far\nas  it\trefers to the mode of  employment,  an\tunreasonable\nrestriction  on\t the fundamental, right of the\temployer  to\ncarry  on  trade.  The matter being entrusted  to  a  quasi-\njudicial tribunal would be decided after giving both parties\nfull   opportunity  of\tpresenting  their  case\t and   after\nconsidering  whether  in the circumstances of  a  particular\ncase  the  restriction\ton  the\t mode  of  employment  is  a\nreasonable restriction or not.\tThe tribunal would always go\ninto the reasonableness of the matter and if it comes to the\nconclusion that the mode of employment desired by labour  is\nnot  reasonable\t it will not allow it; it is  only  when  it\ncomes to the conclusion that the mode of employment  desired\nby labour in a particular case is a reasonable restriction\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">349</span>\nthat  it will insist on that particular mode  of  employment\nbeing used.  Take, for example, the case of contract  labour\nitself.\t  The  tribunal will have to go into the  facts\t of\neach case.  If it comes to the conclusion that on the  facts\nthe  employment\t of contract labour is reasonable  and\tthus\ndoing  away with it would be an unreasonable restriction  on\nthe right of the employer to carry on trade, it will  permit\ncontract  labour to be carried on.  On the other hand if  it\ncomes  to the conclusion that employment of contract  labour\nis  unreasonable in the circumstances of the case before  it\nit  will hold that it should be abolished, the reason  being\nthat its abolition would be a reasonable restriction in\t the\ncircumstances.\t Therefore the decision whether the mode  of\nemployment in a particular case is a reasonable\t restriction\nor  unreasonable  one is in the hands  of  a  quasi-judicial\ntribunal.   In the circumstances it cannot be said  that  by\nproviding  in<a href=\"/doc/89011103/\" id=\"a_24\"> s. 3(18)</a> that an &quot;industrial matter&quot;  includes\nalso  the mode of employment, there is any contravention  of\nthe fundamental right of the employer to carry on trade.  If\nthe argument on behalf of the appellant were to be  accepted\nit  would  mean that judicial and  quasi-judicial  decisions\ncould be unreasonable restrictions on fundamental rights and\nthis  the  Constitution does not envisage at  all.   We\t are\ntherefore of opinion that this contention also fails.\nFinally,  Mr.  Pathak draws our attention to<a href=\"/doc/192162542/\" id=\"a_25\"> ss.  3(13)</a>\t and\n<a href=\"/doc/31148546/\" id=\"a_26\">3(14)</a>  of the Act and submits that the appellant never\tsaid\nthat  contract labour employed in its mills was not  in\t its\nemployment.   <a href=\"/doc/192162542/\" id=\"a_27\">Sec.  3(13)</a> defines the  word  &quot;employee&quot;\t and\nincludes in it any person employed by a contractor to do any\nwork for him in the execution of a contract with an employer\nwithin\tthe meaning of sub-cl. (e) of cl. (14).\t <a href=\"/doc/31148546/\" id=\"a_28\">Sec.  3(14)</a>\ndefines\t the word &quot;employer&quot; in an inclusive manner and\t in-\ncludes &quot;where the owner of any undertaking in the course  of\nor  for the purpose of conducting the undertaking  contracts\nwith any person for the execution by or under the contractor\nof  the\t whole or any part of any work which  is  ordinarily\npart of the undertaking, the owner of the undertaking&quot;.\t  It\nis urged that in view\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">350</span>\nof  these definitions, the employees of the contractors\t are\nthe  employees of the mills and the mills are the  employers\nof  these  employees  of the  contractors.   Therefore,\t Mr.\nPathak\turges  that  there is no  necessity    of abolishing\ncontract labour and that the industrial court may, if it  so\nchooses,  give\tthe same wages and hours of  work  and\trest\nintervals  and other terms and conditions of  employment  to\nthe  employees\tof  the\t contractors  as  are  provided\t for\ncomparable  direct  employees of the appellant and  in\tsuch\ncircumstances  it  would  not be necessary  to\tabolish\t the\ncontract system so long as the employees of contractors\t are\nto  be in the same position as the direct employees  of\t the\nappellant as to their terms and conditions of service.\tThis\nwas  not however the-manner in which the case was  contested\nbefore the industrial court or the appellate tribunal.\t All\nthat we need therefore say is that when the matter goes back\nbefore\tthe  industrial court as directed by  the  appellate\ntribunal,  the industrial court may take this submission  of\nthe  appellant into account and may consider whether  it  is\nnecessary  to  abolish\tthe contract  system,  provided\t the\nappellant  is  able  to assure\tthe  industrial\t court\tthat\nemployees  of  the  contractors who are\t deemed\t to  be\t its\nemployees within the meaning of<a href=\"/doc/192162542/\" id=\"a_29\"> s. 3(13)</a> and<a href=\"/doc/31148546/\" id=\"a_30\"> s. 3(14)</a>  would\nhave  the full benefit of the same terms and  conditions  of\nservice as its comparable direct employees.\nThe appeal fails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">351</span>\n\n\n\n","numcites":12,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":349497,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"rest interval","formInput":"rest%20interval"},{"value":"contract labour","formInput":"contract%20labour"},{"value":"industrial court jurisdiction","formInput":"industrial%20court%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"reasonable restriction","formInput":"reasonable%20restriction"},{"value":"bombay industrial relation act  ","formInput":"bombay%20industrial%20relation%20act%20%20"},{"value":"abolition of contract labours","formInput":"abolition%20of%20contract%20labours"},{"value":"working hours","formInput":"working%20hours"},{"value":"  industrial relations ","formInput":"%20%20industrial%20relations%20"},{"value":"art 19 (1) g","formInput":"art%2019%20%281%29%20g"},{"value":"19 (1) g","formInput":"19%20%281%29%20g"},{"value":"judicial tribunals and quasi ","formInput":"judicial%20tribunals%20and%20quasi%20"},{"value":"\"unreasonable restriction\"","formInput":"%22unreasonable%20restriction%22"},{"value":"quasi judicial","formInput":"quasi%20judicial"},{"value":"unreasonable restriction","formInput":"unreasonable%20restriction"},{"value":"art 19","formInput":"art%2019"},{"value":"342","formInput":"342"},{"value":"appeal  citedby: 935769","formInput":"appeal%20%20citedby%3A%20935769"},{"value":"Judicial and quasi judicial ","formInput":"Judicial%20and%20quasi%20judicial%20"},{"value":"definition   filter:   workman section 2 (s) industrial disputes Act","formInput":"definition%20%20%20filter%3A%20%20%20workman%20section%202%20%28s%29%20industrial%20disputes%20Act"}],"cats":[{"value":"right-to-occupation, fundamental-right","formInput":"tag:right-to-occupation, fundamental-right"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
