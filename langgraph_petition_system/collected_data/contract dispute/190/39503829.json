It provided for\ncompulsory arbitration. It provides for a reference.\nThe Tribunal has the power of rejecting the reference\nat the threshold. It provides for a special limitation. It\nfixes a time limit for passing an Award. <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 14</a> of\nthe Act provides that proceeding and the award can\nbe challenged under special circumstances. <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n17</a>, as noticed hereinbefore, provides for finality of\nthe award, notwithstanding anything to the contrary\ncontained in any other law relating to arbitration.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_5\">It was also observed by their Lordships in\n<a href=\"/doc/1189990/\" id=\"a_11\">Anshuman Shukla</a> (supra) :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;28.

The\n     Tribunal is not one which can be said to\n      be a Domestic Tribunal. The Members of\n     the Tribunal are not nominated by the\n     parties. The disputants do not have any\n     control over their appointment. The\n     Tribunal may reject a reference at the\n     threshold. It has the power to summon\n     records. It has the power to record\n     evidence. Its functions are not limited to\n     one Bench. The Chairman of the Tribunal\n     can refer the disputes to another Bench.\n     Its decision is final. It can award costs. It\n     can award interests. The finality of the\n     decision is fortified by a legal fiction\n     created by making an Award a decree of a\n     Civil Court. It is executable as a decree of\n     a Civil Court. The Award of the Arbitral\n     Tribunal is not subject to the provisions of\n     the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_12\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> and the\n     <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_13\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.\n     The provisions of the said Acts have no\n     application. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">     Some ripples were caused with a decision in V A\nTec Escher Wyass Flovel Limited vs. Madhya Pradesh\nState Electricity Board &amp; another : (2011) 13 SCC 261\nwherein it was held :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     &quot;3. ........

This court, in <a href=\"/doc/1906086/\" id=\"a_16\">V. A. Tec Escher Wyass\n     Flovel Ltd. vs. M.P. S.E. Board (C.A.\n     No.3746/2005</a> decided on 14.1.2010) held\n     that the provisions of the Act would apply\n     where there was an Arbitration clause\n     and the provisions of the 1983 Adhiniyam\n     would apply where there was no\n     Arbitration clause. In this case it is not in\n     dispute that the contract between the\n     parties contained an arbitration clause\n     (clause 29). The decision of the High\n     Court that the provisions of the 1983\n     Adhiniyam      would     apply   and     sole\n     arbitrator appointed by the designate of\n     the    Chief    Justice   lacked    inherent\n     jurisdiction,     cannot    therefore     be\n     sustained. Though the said Arbitration\n     clause provided for reference of disputes\n     to a three member Arbitration Board, the\n     designate chose to appoint a sole\n     arbitrator and that order dated 11.5.2007\n     attained finality.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166421160\" id=\"span_8\">However, the aspect of applicability of the Act of\n1983 or the Act of 1996 in a &#x27;works contract&#x27; came to\nbe   considered   in   <a href=\"/doc/166421160/\" id=\"a_17\">Madhya   Pradesh    Rural     Road\nDevelopment Authority &amp; another vs. L.G.

If this Court compares the\n     provisions of the M.P. Act with A.C. Act\n     1996 then the Court finds that the\n     provisions of M.P. Act are inconsistent\n     with the provisions of A.C. Act 1996.\n     The M.P. Act is a special law providing\n     for statutory arbitration in the State of\n     Madhya Pradesh even in the absence\n     of arbitration agreement. Under the\n     provisions of A.C. Act 1996 in the\n     absence of an arbitration agreement,\n     arbitration is not possible. There is\n     also difference in the formation of\n     arbitration tribunal as is clear from\n     Section 2(1)(d) of A.C. Act 1996. Again\n     under A.C. Act 1996, arbitral tribunal\n     is defined under <a href=\"/doc/318471/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 2(1)(d)</a> as a\n     sole    arbitrator   or   a    panel   of\n     arbitrators. But under M.P. Act such a\n     tribunal is created under <a href=\"/doc/686376/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 3</a>\n     and <a href=\"/doc/354344/\" id=\"a_22\">4</a> of the Act. And under the M.P.\n     Act dispute has a special meaning as\n     defined under <a href=\"/doc/318471/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 2(1)(d)</a> of the\n     Act whereas dispute has not been\n     defined under the A.C. Act 1996.\n     19 . It is clear from its long title that\n     the M.P. Act provides :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     &quot; .... for the establishment of a tribunal\n     to arbitrate in disputes to which the\n     State      Government     or   a    public\n     undertaking [wholly or substantially\n     owned or controlled by the State\n     Government], is a party, and for\n     matters       incidental    thereto     or\n     connected therewith.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"> 20. The structure of the Tribunal under\nthe Madhya Pradesh Act is also\ndifferent from the structure of a\nTribunal under the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_24\">AC Act, 1996</a> ..... &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">23. It is clear from the aforesaid\nenumeration      of     the     statutory\nprovisions that under the M.P. Act the\nparties&#x27; autonomy in the choice of\nArbitaral Tribunal; is not there.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                 (emphasis supplied)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_9\">26. It is clear, therefore, that in view of\nthe aforesaid finding of a co-ordinate\nBench of this Court on the distinct\nfeature of an arbitral tribunal under\nthe said M.P. Act the provisions of M.P.\nAct are saved under Section 2(4) of\nA.C. Act 1996. This Court while\nrendering the decision in Va Tech\n(supra) has not either noticed the\nprevious decision of a co-ordinate\nBench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1189990/\" id=\"a_25\">Anshuman\nShukla</a> (supra) or the provisions of\nSection 2(4) of A.C. Act 1996.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">Therefore, we are constrained to hold\nthat the decision of this Court in Va\nTech (supra) was rendered per\nincuriam.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">39. The M.P. Act of 1983 was made\nwhen the previous <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_26\">Arbitration Act</a> of\n1940 was in the field. <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_27\">That Act</a> of 1940\nwas a Central Law. Both the Acts\noperated in view of <a href=\"/doc/144997/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 46</a> of 1940\nAct. The M.P. Act 1983 was reserved\nfor the assent of the President and\nadmittedly received the same on\n17.10.1983 which was published in the\nMadhya         Pradesh          Gazette\nExtraordinary     dated     12.10.1983.\n Therefore, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_29\">Article\n254(2)</a> of the Constitution was\nsatisfied. Thus, M.P. Act of 1983\nprevails in the State of Madhya\nPradesh. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"674147\" id=\"span_10\">Thereafter, A.C. Act 1996 was\nenacted by Parliament repealing the\nearlier laws of arbitration of 1940. It\nhas also been noted that A.C. Act 1996\nsaves the provisions 24 of M.P. Act\n1983 under sub-<a href=\"/doc/1450090/\" id=\"a_30\">sections 2(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1271430/\" id=\"a_31\">2(5)</a>\nthereof. Therefore, there cannot be any\nrepugnancy. (See the judgment of this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/674147/\" id=\"a_32\">T. Barai vs. Henry Ah Hoe</a>.)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">41. It is clear from the aforesaid\nobservation that in instant case the\nlatter Act made by the Parliament i.e.\nA.C. Act 1996 clearly showed an\nintention to the effect that the State\nLaw of Arbitration i.e. the M.P. Act\nshould operate in the State of Madhya\nPradesh in respect of certain specified\ntypes of arbitrations which are under\nthe M.P. Act 1983. This is clear from\nSections 2(4) and 2(5) of A.C. Act 1996.\nTherefore, there is no substance in the\nargument of repugnancy and is\naccordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">42. Therefore, appeal is allowed and\nthe judgment of the High Court which\nis based on the reasoning of Va Tech\n(supra) is set aside. This Court holds\nthe decision in Va Tech (supra) has\nbeen rendered in per incuriam. In that\nview of the matter the arbitration\nproceeding may proceed under M.P.\nAct of 1983 and not under A.C. Act\n1996.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">This view that in respect of works contract it is\n the Tribunal constituted under 1983 Act and no other\nforum is available was concurred with by Hon&#x27;ble\nJustice Gyan Sudha Mishra in the following terms :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     &quot;49. In view of this, the legal and\n     logical consequence which can be\n     reasonably drawn from the definition\n     of &#x27;works contract&#x27; would be, that if\n     there is a dispute between the\n     contracting parties for any reason\n     relating to works contract which\n     include execution of any work, relating\n     to construction, repair or maintenance\n     of any building or super-structure,\n     dam, weir, canal, reservoir, tank, lake,\n     road, well, bridge, culvert, factory,\n     workshop, power house, transformers\n     or such other works of the State\n     Government or Public Undertaking\n     including an agreement for the supply\n     of goods or material and all other\n     matters relating to the execution of\n     any of the said works, the same would\n     fall within the ambit of the definition of\n     &#x27;works contract&#x27; and hence all disputes\n     pertaining or arising out of execution\n     of the works contract will have to be\n     referred to the M.P. State Arbitration\n     Tribunal as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 7</a>\n     of the Act of 1983. Hence, in addition\n     to the reasons assigned in the\n     judgment and order of learned Brother\n     Justice Ganguly, disputes arising out of\n     execution of works contract has to be\n     referred to the M.P. State Arbitration\n     Tribunal and not under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_34\">Arbitration\n     and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">     Thus, there remains no iota of doubt that in case\n of works contract covered by the provisions of 1983\nAct, any dispute is compulsorily has to be raised\nbefore the Tribunal constituted under the Act of 1983\nwhich necessarily means that the forum under 1996\nAct are excluded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">          In view whereof, this Court decline to entertain\nthe application under <a href=\"/doc/401357/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 11 (5) (6)</a> of 1996 Act\nand dismiss the application however with a liberty to\nthe petitioner to avail the remedy available to him\nunder the Agreement in question and under the 1983\nAct.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">          There shall be no costs.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">                                       (SANJAY YADAV)\n                                           JUDGE\n\n\n\n\nLoretta\n For the reasons stated in A. C. No.64/2010, this  A. C. is also disposed of on the same terms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">           A copy of the order passed today in A. C. No.64/2010 be kept in this case also.\n</p> ","numcites":21,"numcitedby":17,"docsource":"Madhya Pradesh High Court","citetid":39503829,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"works contract","formInput":"works%20contract"},{"value":"adhiniyam, 1983","formInput":"adhiniyam%2C%201983"},{"value":"va tech","formInput":"va%20tech"},{"value":"escher wyass flovel","formInput":"escher%20wyass%20flovel"},{"value":"arbitral tribunal ","formInput":"arbitral%20tribunal%20"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"anshuman shukla","formInput":"anshuman%20shukla"},{"value":"Award  filter:  Madhyastham","formInput":"Award%20%20filter%3A%20%20Madhyastham"},{"value":"\\\"works contract\\\"  ","formInput":"%5C%22works%20contract%5C%22%20%20"},{"value":"arbitration act","formInput":"arbitration%20act"},{"value":"arbitration agreement","formInput":"arbitration%20agreement"},{"value":"\"arbitration clause\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20clause%22"},{"value":"sole arbitrator","formInput":"sole%20arbitrator"},{"value":"\"arbitration agreement\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20agreement%22"},{"value":"sec 2(1)(d)","formInput":"sec%202%281%29%28d%29"}],"cats":[{"value":"arbitration-and-conciliation","formInput":"tag:arbitration-and-conciliation"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
