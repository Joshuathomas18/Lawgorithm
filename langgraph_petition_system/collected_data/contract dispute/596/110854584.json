The appellant is aggrieved by a judgment of a Single Judge dismissing\nhis writ petition for want of territorial jurisdiction. An order dated 12.08.2016\ndismissing the subsequent review petition, too has been impugned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.      The appellant entered into a dealership agreement dated 06.03.1992\nwith the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. („IOCL‟), whereby the Appellant was\nappointed „dealer‟ for the sale and supply of certain petroleum products.\nIOCL is represented through its officers, the second to fourth respondents.\nThe retail outlet allotted to the petitioner, located in Ghaziabad was owned by\nthe Ghaziabad Development Authority („GDA‟) and had been leased to\nIOCL. The lease expired in 2008.Subsequent efforts by IOCL to renew the\nlease were unsuccessful. The Petitioner was therefore served with an eviction\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">LPA 498/2016                                                           Page 1 of 20</span>\n notice relating to the dealership on 24.09.2012. He alleges to have continued\nto maintain the outlet and provide security for it after it was closed down by\norders of the GDA in November 2012. He resigned from the dealership\nagreement with IOCL vide letter dated 25.09.2013, stating therein that he felt\ncompelled to resign as he was unable to bear maintenance and security costs\nof a closed outlet. In accordance with the resignation letter, the IOCL\nterminated the dealership agreement by termination letter dated17.12.2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3.     The Appellant thereafter, through representations made to IOCL\nsought revival of his erstwhile dealership or re-sitement, in accordance with\nthe guidelines on &quot;Reconstitution, re-sitement and Revival of retail outlets&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">issued by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, through letter dated\n17.11.2005. As his representations were of no avail, he approached this court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. IOCL contended that this court\nought not to exercise jurisdiction and instead, dismiss the writ petition,\nallowing the appellant to approach the concerned High Court since the cause\nof action and the outlet fell outside the territorial jurisdiction of this court.\nThe single judge, by the impugned order therefore, dismissed the writ\npetition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Contentions of the Parties\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"23112747\" id=\"span_2\">4.     The appellant argues that the single judge erred in law in rejecting the\nwrit petition. It is contended that the dealership agreement dated 06.03.1992,\nentered into between the appellant and IOCL, provided for the jurisdiction of\nthe courts at New Delhi, to entertain any suit, application or other proceeding\nin respect of any claim or dispute arising under the agreement. It is urged that\nthis court has exclusive jurisdiction over the matter and if recourse had been\nmade to the Allahabad High Court, the petition would have been dismissed\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">LPA 498/2016                                                          Page 2 of 20</span>\n for want of territorial jurisdiction. He places reliance on the decision of the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in M/s <a href=\"/doc/23112747/\" id=\"a_2\">Swastik Gases P. Ltd. v. Indian Oil\nCorporation</a> (2013) 9 SCC 32, to contend that exclusive jurisdiction has been\nconferred by agreement onto the Courts at Delhi.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1107633\" id=\"span_4\">5.     The learned counsel for the appellant, urges that the principle of\ndominus litis be applied, placing reliance on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/1107633/\" id=\"a_3\">Indian Institute\nof Technology v. P.C Jain and Ors.</a>, 45 (1991) DLT 42, and Sri Nasiruddin v.\nState Transport Appellate Tribunal, (1975) 2 SCC 671. He further contends\nthat it is only in very rare cases that the court overlooks dominus litis of the\npetitioner and rejects the petition on grounds of inappropriateness of\njurisdiction, such as, when jurisdiction has been invoked with malafide\nintent. He argues that such a situation warranting rejection of dominus litis\ndoes not exist in the present matter.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1876565\" id=\"span_5\">Additionally, relying on <a href=\"/doc/1876565/\" id=\"a_4\">Kusum Ingots &amp;\nAlloys Ltd. v. Union of India</a> (2004) 6 SCC 254, it is argued that the High\nCourt will have jurisdiction in the matter even if a fraction of the cause of\naction accrued within the territory of the High Court, and in the present case\na large part of the cause of action arose in Delhi owing to the dealership\nagreement having been entered into at Delhi, as well as its clause 66\nspecifically provide for jurisdiction of the courts at New Delhi.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115567041\" id=\"span_6\">6.     Counsel for the appellant distinguished <a href=\"/doc/115567041/\" id=\"a_5\">Sterling Agro v. UOI</a> (2011)\nDLT 658, relied on in the impugned orders, by contending that the facts of\nthe case are starkly different from the present matter at hand. He urges that in\nSterling Agro the petitioner, being dissatisfied with the Order of the Ministry\nof Finance, challenged the sustainability of the order, invoking the\njurisdiction of the Delhi High Court, based on the fact that the revisional\nauthority for the said order (Office of the Joint Secretary to the GOI) was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">LPA 498/2016                                                          Page 3 of 20</span>\n located in Delhi. On the other hand, in the present matter, the premise for\ninvoking the jurisdiction of this Court is that the appellant is a resident of\nDelhi, the dealership agreement was executed in Delhi and provides for the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the courts at Delhi.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"59290853\" id=\"span_8\">7.     It is argued moreover that the single judge erred in recording that the\npetitioner is seeking revival of his previous outlet at Ghaziabad. It is\ncontended to the contrary, stating that he requested for re-sitement in Delhi\nand not revival of the erstwhile outlet at Ghaziabad, as he is a resident of\nDelhi. He alleges that the only outlets available in NCR, are those ones in\nDelhi and that he is seeking implementation of the guidelines framed by the\nUnion Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, which is in Delhi.\nAccordingly, the Appellant seeks to distinguish the decision in <a href=\"/doc/59290853/\" id=\"a_6\">Jagdambay\nAuto Station and Anr. V. UOI and Others</a>, WP(C) 6398/2010, decided on\n1stNovember, 2012, relied on by the impugned order. It is contended that\nthere the order of IOCL terminating the dealership was issued at Chandigarh\nand the petitioner sought restoration of his dealership situated at Jalandhar,\nwhereas, in the present matter, the appellant is seeking resitement at Delhi\nand not revival of his dealership at Ghaziabad.</span>        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115567041\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167214133\" id=\"span_10\">The reliance- by the\nimpugned order, on <a href=\"/doc/167214133/\" id=\"a_7\">Vishnu Security Services v.

Ministry of Environment and Forests</a> 189 (2012)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">LPA 498/2016                                                        Page 4 of 20</span>\n DLT 550 (DB), wherein it was held that &quot;for ousting the jurisdiction of the\ncourt on the doctrine of forum non-conveniens, a case of another Court being\nbetter equipped and Convenient for all parties concerned has to be made out\nand the Court cannot refuse to exercise jurisdiction by mere lip service to the\nsaid doctrine&quot;.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.     In response, the learned counsel for IOCL argues that no cause of\naction has arisen in the territory of Delhi, thereby the jurisdiction of this court\nis precluded. IOCL argues that the appellant‟s dealership was located in\nGhaziabad, the appellant of his own volition resigned from the dealership\nagreement by letter dated 25. 09. 2013, subsequent to which, the letter\nterminating the dealership, dated 17. 12 .2013, was issued from Ghaziabad. It\nis contended that territorial jurisdiction cannot be conferred by agreement.\nIOCL contends that the Resitement policy, namely policy no. 205-10/2012 in\nClause 1.4, provides &quot;Resitement with state/UT boundaries can be allowed in\ncases...(ii)in all such cases, onus to provide land will be on the dealer&quot; and\nin Clause 2.2, provides that &quot;change of location at LOI stage as per Clause\n2.1 will be permitted within the same district.&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">9.     IOCL argues that, in accordance with the policy, re-sitement within the\nstate can only be allowed by the land agency, i.e. the Ghaziabad\nDevelopment Authority and the onus is on the Appellant to provide the land.\nThe learned counsel for IOCL thereby urges that there is no nexus between\nthe cause of action, which rests in the resitement policy, and the dealership\nagreement on the basis of which the Appellant seeks to invoke the\njurisdiction of this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">Decision and reasoning\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">10.

At the outset, it is apparent that Clause 66 of the dealership agreement\nis only applicable to disputes „arising under the agreement‟.

Furthermore, the decision in Jai Ganesh Petroleum (Writ Petition (C)\nNo. 5133/2005); Khutar Filling Station (Writ Petition (C) No. 5167/2005)\nand M/s Annapurna Filling station (Writ Petition (C) No. 16946/2004)\ndecided by a common judgment dated 23.12.2005, relied on by IOCL,\ncontemplates the same question.

[...] In construing the expression &quot;arising out of&quot; in the\n       context of an arbitration clause contained in an agreement, the\n       Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/999478/\" id=\"a_12\">Union of India v. Salween\n       Timber Construction(India) &amp;Ors.</a>, 1969 (2) SCR 224 laid\n       down the following test: &quot;In our opinion the claim made by the\n       respondent firm was a claim arising out of the contract. The\n       test for determining the question is whether recourse to the\n       contract by which both the parties are bound is necessary for\n       the purpose of determining whether the claim of the respondent\n       firm is justified or otherwise. If it is necessary to take recourse\n       to the terms of the contract for the purpose of deciding the\n       matter in dispute it must be held that the matter is within the\n       scope of the arbitration clause and the arbitrators have\n       jurisdiction to decide the case.&quot; Does the issue raised in the\n       present petition fall within the expression &quot;claim or dispute\n       arising under this agreement&quot; appearing in Clause 68 of the\n       said agreement? The test for determining the question is\n       whether recourse to the said agreement is necessary for the\n       purpose of deterring these issues? Recourse to the agreement is\n       not necessary for considering the incident of the inspection.\n       Recourse to the agreement is not necessary while taking up the\n       issue of drawing of samples and the correct procedure therefor.\n       Recourse to the agreement is also not necessary for deciding\n       the question as to whether the show cause notice dated\n       16.8.2003 is valid and legal. Clause 68 of the said agreement is\n       not at all attracted.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">       These decisions clarify that for the claim or dispute to arise under the\nagreement, recourse must necessarily be had to the agreement, in order to\ndetermine the merits of the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">13.

Furthermore, he sought decision of whether the\ndealership agreement dated 06.03.1992 had been terminated in a wrongful\nand arbitrary manner. The appellant contended throughout that the Single\nJudge erroneously recorded that he sought revival of the dealership located at\nGhaziabad, whereas he sought resitement. The appellant‟s averments, in the\nwrit petition, render this contention unacceptable.

While arguing that the present dispute does not arise under the\ndealership agreement, IOCL relied on <a href=\"/doc/83662/\" id=\"a_13\">Phool Service Station v. Indian Oil\nCorporation Ltd.</a> [2003 (71) DRJ], where the petitioner‟s outlet was located\nin the State of Uttar Pradesh and the dispute pertained to the sampling\nprocedure adopted by the respondents. The Court therein held that the dispute\ndid not arise „under the agreement‟ and hence the jurisdiction clause of the\nagreement would not be applicable.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"83662\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"50546\" id=\"span_21\">The decisions of <a href=\"/doc/50546/\" id=\"a_14\">Hilal Filling\nStation</a>(supra) and <a href=\"/doc/83662/\" id=\"a_15\">Phool Service Station</a>(supra) have been considered by this\nCourt in Jai Ganesh Petroleum (supra), which was also relied upon by the\nrespondent. There, the Court examined the facts of each case and held that\nthe existence of a clause conferring jurisdiction of the courts at Delhi was not\nsufficient to entitle the petitioners in those cases to approach this Court under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.</span></span> In Jai Ganesh Petroleum (supra), the\naction had arisen due to an inspection carried out at the retail outlet which\nwas located in U.P., the samples drawn therefrom had been tested and had\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">LPA 498/2016                                                           Page 8 of 20</span>\n failed, it was thus held that the cause of action arose in U.P. and the dispute\nhad not arisen under the dealership agreement. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50546\" id=\"span_23\">Similarly, in <a href=\"/doc/50546/\" id=\"a_17\">Khuttar Filling\nStation</a> (supra), the dealership agreement was entered in Delhi for setting up\na petrol pump in Uttar Pradesh. The dispute once again related to the method\nof taking samples from the petrol pump of the petitioner, the Court held\ntherein, that the dispute did not arise under the dealership agreement and that\nno part of the cause of action arose in Delhi.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"50546\" id=\"span_24\">The facts of <a href=\"/doc/50546/\" id=\"a_18\">Annapurna Filling\nStation</a> (supra) were similar in nature, therein it was held,\n       &quot;51. I have noticed the authoritative judicial pronouncements\n       afore stated to the effect that the dispute relating to violation of\n       Marketing Discipline Guidelines, short supplies etc. do not\n       arise under the agreement and as such a party could not place\n       reliance on Clause 68 of the agreement in support of the\n       submission that the courts in the city of Delhi alone could have\n       jurisdiction to entertain any suit, application or other\n       proceedings in respect of such claim. Furthermore, the retail\n       outlet of the petitioner is located on Mainpuri in the city of\n       Uttar Pradesh which is beyond the territorial jurisdiction of\n       this court. The show cause notice has been issued from Uttar\n       Pradesh and the reply was sent by the petitioner to Uttar\n       Pradesh. The order was passed after consideration thereof at\n       Uttar Pradesh. Such order has been impugned in the present\n       writ petition. I find, therefore that no material fact having a\n       nexus with the lis has arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of\n       this court.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59290853\" id=\"span_25\">15.    This Court in <a href=\"/doc/59290853/\" id=\"a_19\">Jagdambay Auto Station and Anr. v. UOI and Others</a>,\n[WP (C) 6398/2010] further considered the above decisions. There the\ndispute resulted from an inspection carried out by the Anti Adulteration\nTeam of the respondent, at the petitioner‟s petrol pump, located at Jalandhar.\nThis resulted in the issuance of a show cause notice and subsequently an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">LPA 498/2016                                                            Page 9 of 20</span>\n order, passed by the IOCL in Chandigarh, terminating the dealership of the\npetitioner. The above decisions involved disputes concerning inspection and\nsampling carried out at the retail outlets and subsequent irregularities. It was\naccordingly held that these disputes did not arise under the dealership\nagreement and as the inspections/sampling were carried out at the location of\nthe retail outlets, it was held that the cause of action arose therein and not\nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. However, the same reasoning\ncannot be applied to the facts of the matter at hand. In the present matter, the\ndispute pertains to the termination of the dealership agreement, revival of this\nagreement, and re-sitement. It is our considered view that in order to\neffectively decide the merits of these claims, recourse would have to be made\nto the dealership agreement-containing clause 66. The policy of Revival and\nre-sitement i.e. the policy enumerated by circular dated 17.11.2005 of the\nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is premised on the original dealership\nagreement. To determine the question whether the termination was arbitrary,\nrecourse must be made to terms of the dealership agreement. Revival of a\ndealership takes into regard the grounds for termination and only comes into\nplay for individuals who previously had valid, subsisting dealership\nagreements with IOCL. Clause 3.1 and 3.2 of this policy enumerate that re-\nsitement is only available at the LOI (Letter of Intent) stage and for a\ncommissioned dealership, respectively, thus the very basis to consider the\nplea of resitement is the dealership agreement.

It was held therein,\n       &quot;Keeping in view the expression &quot;cause of action&quot; used in\n       clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,\n       indisputably even if a small fraction thereof accrues within the\n       Jurisdiction of the Court, the Court will have Jurisdiction in the\n       matter though the doctrine of forum conveniens may also have\n       to be considered.&quot; &quot;[...] the cause of action has no relation\n       whatsoever to the defense which may be set up by the\n       defendant, nor does it depend upon the character of the relief\n       prayed for by the plaintiff. It refers entirely to the ground set\n       forth in the plaint as the cause of action, or, in other words, to\n       the media upon which the plaintiff asks the court to arrive at a\n       conclusion in his favour.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1307808\" id=\"span_32\">19.

It is seen from the above that in order to confer\n       jurisdiction on a High Court to entertain a writ petition or a\n       special civil application as in this case, the High Court must be\n       satisfied from the entire facts pleaded in support of the cause of\n       action that those facts do constitute a cause so as to empower\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">LPA 498/2016                                                           Page 12 of 20</span>\n        the court to decide a dispute which has, at least in part, arisen\n       within its jurisdiction. It is clear from the above judgment that\n       each and every fact pleaded by the respondents in their\n       application does not ipso facto lead to the conclusion that those\n       facts give rise to a cause of action within the court&#x27;s territorial\n       jurisdiction unless those facts pleaded are such which have a\n       nexus or relevance with the lis that is involved in the case.\n       Facts which have no bearing with the lis or the dispute involved\n       in the case, do not give rise to a cause of action so as to confer\n       territorial jurisdiction on the court concerned.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">20.    It is therefore, necessary to determine which facts pleaded by the\nparties are integral to the present dispute and relate to the lis, thereby,\nelucidating whether the cause of action wholly or in part, arose within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of this Court. The appellant‟s argues the dealership\nagreement was entered into at Delhi, all payments under it were to be made at\nNew Delhi and it provided that the courts at Delhi were to have jurisdiction\nover any dispute or claim arising under the agreement. The regional office of\nIOCL is located at Barakhamba Road in Delhi, within the jurisdiction of this\ncourt. He further contends that he is a resident of Delhi and is seeking re-\nsitement within Delhi. The Respondents argue that the Policy contemplates\ngrant of re-sitement only within the same state, which in the present case is\nUttar Pradesh and further that such re-sitement can only be allowed by the\nland agency, namely the Ghaziabad Development Authority, and therefore\nthe cause of action arose in Ghaziabad beyond the territorial jurisdiction of\nthis Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">21.    This court is un-persuaded by IOCL‟s contention that the dispute is\noutside its jurisdiction as resitement is to be granted by the Ghaziabad\nDevelopment Authority, which is not in the territorial jurisdiction of this\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">LPA 498/2016                                                          Page 13 of 20</span>\n Court. Here the court notes that <a href=\"/doc/618973/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 226 (2)</a> of the Constitution, provides\nthat the High Court can issue a writ even when the authority against whom\nsuch writ is issued is outside the territorial jurisdiction of such court, if the\ncause of action wholly or partially arises within the territorial jurisdiction of\nthe court. Moreover, the location of the erstwhile dealership outlet in relation\nto which the present matter arises, in Ghaziabad also leads to the conclusion\nthat a part of the cause of action arises in Ghaziabad. However this does not\nper se preclude the cause of action, having in partly arisen in Delhi. The\nappellant‟s contention that the cause of action arose within the territorial\njurisdiction of this Court he resides in Delhi and seeks resitement in Delhi,\nhowever is irrelevant. In the considered opinion of this court the act of\nsigning and executing the dealership agreement within the territorial\njurisdiction of this court containing a jurisdiction clause, providing for the\nexclusive jurisdiction of this court is pertinent to the dispute at hand. The\nquestions of whether or not the termination was wrongful, whether revival or\nresitement can be granted to the appellant have to be decided on the basis of\nthe said agreement. Thus we find that the cause of action arose, in part within\nthe territorial jurisdiction of this Court and in part, in Ghaziabad.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">22.    Furthermore this court has jurisdiction owing to the fact that the\nregional office of IOCL is located at Barakhamba Road in New Delhi,\nthereby placing it within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 20</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"51545606\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"511173\" id=\"span_36\">(a) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_28\">of the CPC</a>, 1908 in clause (a) to (c), provides the plaintiff with a choice\nof forum to institute the suit.

It is\nsettled by way of judicial decisions that, where there are two or more courts\nwhich can entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause of action\nhaving arisen therewith, if the parties to the contract agreed to vest\njurisdiction in one such court to try the dispute which might arise as between\nthemselves, the agreement would be valid.</span></span> [Shriram City Union Finance\nCorp.

He contends that the petitioner therein, being\ndissatisfied with the order of the Ministry of Finance, challenged the same by\ninvoking the inherent jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 226</a>\nof the Constitution of India, based solely on the fact that the appellate\nauthority was located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. On the\ncontrary, he contends that in the present case, the cause of action arose within\nthe territorial jurisdiction of this Court. He further argued that that the\nLearned Single Judge in his order dated 27.04.2016, failed to provide cogent\nreasons as to why some other High Court would be better suited to determine\nthe matter.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167214133\" id=\"span_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59290853\" id=\"span_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115567041\" id=\"span_64\">28.    The Single Judge, correctly placed reliance on the decision of the full\nbench in <a href=\"/doc/115567041/\" id=\"a_56\">Sterling Agro</a> (supra) and Chinteshwar Steels (supra) to determine\nthe allegation raised by the appellant therein that, the decision in <a href=\"/doc/59290853/\" id=\"a_57\">Jagdambay\nAuto Station</a> (supra) was contrary to the decision of the division bench of this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/167214133/\" id=\"a_58\">Vishnu Security Services</a> (supra).</span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59290853\" id=\"span_65\">It is our opinion that the Learned\nSingle Judge, in the order dated 27.04.2016, having determined that no part\nof the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of this Court, did not feel\ncompelled to rely on the doctrine of forum conveniens, and made reference to\nthe same in the limited context of determining whether it was contrary to the\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/59290853/\" id=\"a_59\">Jagdambay Auto Station</a> (supra).
