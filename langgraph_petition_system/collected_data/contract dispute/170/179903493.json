The Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd (hereafter “the\n\n         insurer” or “the appellant”) appeals the decision of a single judge\n\n         of the Bombay High Court, who allowed the respondent’s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n\n         application\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">NARENDRA PRASAD</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2019.11.13</span>\n                                under   Section   11(6)   of   the    Arbitration   and\n17:50:41 IST\nReason:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_1\">Conciliation Act, 1996</a> (hereafter “the Act”) and appointed an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                2</span>\n\narbitrator. The insurer’s objection about maintainability of the\n\napplication on the ground that the respondent (hereafter\n\n“Dicitex”) had signed the discharge voucher and accepted the\n\namount offered, thus, signifying accord and satisfaction, which in\n\nturn meant that there was no arbitrable dispute, was rejected.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.   The relevant facts in this appeal are that on 17.09.2011,\n\nDicitex obtained a Standard Fire and Special Peril Policy; it was\n\nissued by the appellant to cover the stocks of goods lying in its\n\nthree separate godowns located at Thane, Maharashtra, by three\n\nseparate endorsements. The total sum insured was @ ₹13 crores.\n\nClause 13 of the terms and conditions of the said policy\n\ncontained an arbitration clause. On 25.05.2012, a fire broke out\n\nat night on the ground floor of the building occupied by RFCL,\n\nwhich fire spread to the first floor of the building and completely\n\nengulfed all of the appellant’s three godowns which had stored its\n\ngoods. All the stocks in all the three godowns were completely\n\ndestroyed. Dicitex informed the appellant on 26.05.2012, about\n\nthe fire and the consequential loss. The appellant appointed M/s.\n\nC.P. Mehta &amp; Co. as Surveyors and Assessors to survey the loss\n\nsuffered by Dicitex and to report on the claim to be lodged upon\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                 3</span>\n\nthe insurer­appellant, by the said company. Dicitex lodged a total\n\nand final claim upon the appellant for a sum of ₹14,88,14,327/­\n\ncomprising ₹13,52,85,752/­ towards cost of the materials\n\ndestroyed and ₹1,35,28,575/­ as overheads. Dicitex claims also\n\nto have submitted comprehensive documentary evidence and\n\ndetailed work sheets in support of the claim made to the insurer.\n\nOn 14.08.2012, after visiting Dicitex’s factory and the godowns,\n\nand after scrutinizing the materials submitted by it in support of\n\nits claim, the Surveyor appointed by the insurer filed a Final\n\nSurvey Report recommending that the claim be settled for an\n\namount of ₹12,93,26,704.98/­ and that after deducting an\n\namount of 5% towards compulsory deduction for excess, a net\n\namount of ₹12,28,60,369/­ be paid over to Dicitex. The latter\n\nalleged that a copy of this survey report was not supplied to it, by\n\nthe insurer, or the surveyor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.   On 20.09.2012, Dicitex addressed a letter to the appellant’s\n\nchairman, informing him of the financial distress that it was\n\nfacing, requesting for settlement of the claim on priority basis.\n\nDicitex also informed him about a temporary loan obtained ­to\n\nthe tune of ₹10 crores­ from Union Bank of India for 3 months at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                  4</span>\n\na high rate of interest which was due for repayment in September\n\n2012 and requested him that it would be a great financial help if\n\nits claim could be settled on priority basis which would mitigate\n\ntheir hardship. Again, on 25.10.2012, Dicitex informed the\n\ninsurer that the sale value of the goods destroyed was above ₹19\n\ncrores and that it had not only lost its goods but also its profits.\n\nDicitex   informed   that   it   had   already   submitted   all   the\n\ndocumentary evidence supporting the claim to the Surveyor,\n\nM/s. C.P. Mehta &amp; Co., yet another letter was addressed to the\n\nappellant’s chairman on 31.10.2012 placing on record that it had\n\nunderstood from the surveyor M/s. C.P. Mehta &amp; Co. that the\n\nHead Office of the appellant asked for some more information in\n\nconnection with the claim. Dicitex stated that compiling,\n\norganizing and sending various documents totalling around\n\n35,000 in number, entailed voluminous work. It was stated that\n\nthe surveyor had already gone through those documents and had\n\npicked up at random, sample of various concerned records.\n\nDicitex stated that it was arranging to compile the documents\n\nand agreed to send them to the surveyor as soon as possible. In\n\nother letters (dated 10.01.2012, 28.01.2013), again requests were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                   5</span>\n\nmade to the insurer to release the amounts. Apparently, the\n\nappellant appointed a Chartered Accountant (M/s Naveen Jhand\n\n&amp; Associates) to carry out a resurvey of the claim made by it\n\n(Dicitex). The latter had already furnished 37,700 documents\n\nphysically, which showed the exact quantity of furnishing fabrics\n\nin meters. Dicitex brought to the notice of the Chairman­cum­\n\nManaging Director that the new surveyors had asked for large\n\nnumber of documents again and such documents could not be\n\nsupplied. On 09.02.2013, addressing the new surveyor M/s\n\nNaveen      Jhand,   Dicitex   submitted   37,700   documents   and\n\nsubmitted further documents to the said new surveyor. It\n\nsubmitted that since the previous 9 months, it had been\n\nproviding different documents/information to different people\n\nand submitted whatever was requested by the new surveyor in\n\nbroader form and requested them to submit their report at the\n\nearliest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.   In accordance with the format sent by the insurer and after\n\nobtaining Dicitex’s signature, a cheque for ₹3.5 crores was\n\nhanded over to it. Dicitex signed the discharge voucher on\n\n04.03.2013, when the insurer paid the said sum of ₹3.5 crores to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                 6</span>\n\nDicitex as &#x27;on account payment&#x27; in the matter of its claim. Union\n\nBank of India endorsed the said discharge voucher. According to\n\nDicitex, all data that was requisitioned by the new surveyor, was\n\nprovided by it. Several meetings took place between the\n\nrepresentatives of the new surveyor, the appellant and Dicitex.\n\nDicitex, mentioned several letters to the appellant, and the\n\nsurveyor, in 2013 regarding the release of the amounts. Dicitex\n\nhad also stated that it felt strongly that the new surveyor was\n\njust not satisfied with whatever was provided by it though all the\n\ndata it submitted had proved its genuine claim and the intention\n\nof the new surveyor was to somehow reduce the claim. In other\n\nletters (such as the one dated 21.02.2014), Dicitex informed the\n\nappellant that the surveyor was refusing to commit to any fixed\n\ndate within which they would be submitting their report and also\n\nthe appellant’s officials had no answers to its questions with\n\nregard to when its claim would be settled. Dicitex requested the\n\nGeneral Manager to set a deadline to settle their claim at the\n\nearliest. It wrote several letters to the appellant’s officers about\n\nthe huge financial losses suffered by it due to delay in settlement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                   7</span>\n\nof the claim. Dicitex informed the General Manager to settle the\n\nclaim within 15 days.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.     On 27th May, 2014, Dicitex received an email from the\n\nappellant stating that a discharge voucher for the balance\n\namount of the claim payable as described was being enclosed. It\n\nwas requested to execute the voucher along with the bank&#x27;s\n\ndischarge on the space earmarked on the left side and send the\n\nscanned copy back. By the email dated 28.05.2014, Dicitex\n\nreplied to the email of 27.05.2014 and referred to the discharge\n\nvoucher sent by the appellant to it for signature. Dicitex placed\n\non record that its total claim was approximately ₹15 crores and\n\nthe surveyor had assessed the same at approximately ₹12.93\n\ncrores. Dicitex stated that the basis for arriving at the figure of\n\n₹7.16 crores was not explained (by the appellant). It requested\n\nthe Regional Manager of the appellant to provide the claim\n\nassessment working for their understanding to enable Dicitex to\n\ntake    up   the   matter   with   their   Board   of   Directors   for\n\nconsideration. The appellant, by email dated 29.05.2014, alleged\n\nthat M/s. C. P. Mehta &amp; Co. had initially assessed the loss at\n\n₹12,28,60,369/­. However, it had certain issues on the costing;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                 8</span>\n\nit, therefore, appointed M/s. Naveen Jhand and Associates to\n\nhave another look at the costing aspect and reconfirm/verify the\n\ncosting for loss assessment purpose. According to the said report\n\nsubmitted by M/s. Naveen Jhand and Associates, the assessment\n\nworked to ₹7,16,30,148/­ and accordingly, the competent\n\nauthority had granted the claim. The appellant enclosed the\n\nworking of the claim and requested Dicitex to go through it and\n\nsend an unconditional discharge voucher duly signed by it and\n\nthe bankers. Dicitex, the insured did not do so and informed the\n\nappellant that it had noticed that what was given was just a\n\nstatement   of   calculation,   without   explanation/basis,   that\n\nadjustments had resultant deductions in Dicitex’s claim by more\n\nthan 50% as assessed by the surveyor appointed by the\n\nappellant. Dicitex stated that since the appellant had taken 2\n\nyears to offer the final settlement of the claim, it (Dicitex) was\n\nsuffering from a huge financial constraint and had to pay bank\n\ninterest and installments, salaries and wages, hence, it was left\n\nwith no alternative but to accept the offer of the appellant\n\nreluctantly and was accordingly sending the voucher duly\n\ndischarged by Dicitex and their bankers for doing the needful.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                 9</span>\n\nDicitex alleged that since the appellant did not relent, and\n\ninsisted that any further payment would be made only if the\n\ndischarge voucher was executed exactly at the time and in the\n\nform and manner as required by it as well as the letter dated\n\n31.05.2014 was withdrawn. Dicitex stated that as it was in\n\nurgent need of funds to meet its mounting liabilities, it was\n\ncoerced into withdrawing its earlier letter of 31.05.2014 and in\n\nexecuting the discharge voucher exactly as dictated by the\n\nrespondents. By the letter dated 06.06.2014, addressed to the\n\nRegional Manager, Dicitex withdrew the letter dated 31.05.2014\n\nsubmitted along with the discharge voucher for a full and final\n\nsettlement of their claim. It requested the appellant to remit the\n\nclaim amount immediately. The discharge voucher was on the\n\nletter head of the appellant, duly endorsed by Dicitex’s bankers.\n\nIn the discharge voucher, it was recorded that it accepted a sum\n\nof ₹3,66,30,148/­ in full and final settlement of its claim. It was\n\nalso recorded that Dicitex voluntarily gave discharge receipt in\n\nfull and final settlement of their claim, present or future, arising\n\ndirectly/indirectly in respect of the said loss/accident and\n\nsubrogated all their rights and remedies to appellant in respect of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                10</span>\n\nthe loss/damages. Further correspondence ensued whereby\n\nDicitex informed the appellant that since there was a huge\n\ndifference between the total amount claimed by it, and the final\n\nclaim settlement amount by the appellant, the same was required\n\nto be discussed and resolved, failing which Dicitex would be\n\nrequired to invoke the arbitration, as per clause 13 of the terms\n\nand conditions attached to the policy. The appellant, by the letter\n\ndated 17.07.2014 addressed to Dicitex, informed that it was\n\nsurprised by the proposal to invoke arbitration after the clean\n\ndischarge voucher was signed for the sum of ₹7,16,30,148/­ in\n\nfull and final settlement of the said loss. The respondents denied\n\nthat there existed any dispute of quantum in respect of the said\n\nclaim and contended that the amount due to Dicitex arising out\n\nof indemnity, arising from the policy was duly verified and\n\nassessed based on the documents submitted by Dicitex. The\n\nappellant did not agree to Dicitex’s request for any differential\n\namount or request for proceeding for arbitration under the policy.\n\nOn 24.07.2014, by a letter addressed to the appellant, Dicitex\n\ndenied that the amount received by it was a clean discharge\n\nvoucher in full and final settlement of their claim and reiterated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                11</span>\n\nthat it suffered a major loss of ₹14,16,94,329/­. The surveyor,\n\nM/s. C.P. Mehta &amp; Co. had submitted their report assessing the\n\nloss at ₹12.93 crores. Dicitex also placed on record that as\n\nagainst approximately the claim of ₹ 14.70 crores, the appellant\n\nreleased only ₹3.50 crores on 04.03.2013 i.e. almost 10 months\n\nafter the loss had occurred, and after a lapse of 27 months, the\n\nappellant made &quot;a take it or leave it&quot; offer of ₹7.16 crores towards\n\nfull and final settlement of their claim, the discharge was\n\naccepted reluctantly by it. Dicitex alleged that upon meeting the\n\nappellant’s officers, it was instructed to withdraw the letter of\n\nprotest and accept the claim settlement unconditionally which\n\nwas a proof of coercion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.   The position taken by the appellant was that Dicitex was\n\npaid ₹7,16,30,148/­ in a clean discharge and full and final\n\nsettlement of their claim and there existed no dispute with regard\n\nto the quantum of claim and refused to appoint any arbitrator. In\n\nthese circumstances, Dicitex approached the Bombay High Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nDicitex relied on the assessment of M/s C.P. Mehta &amp; Co., which\n\nhad assessed the loss at ₹12.93 crores. It contended that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                               12</span>\n\nappellant released only ₹ 3.50 crores on 4.03.2013 i.e. almost 10\n\nmonths after the loss suffered by Dicitex due to fire, and only\n\nafter a lapse of 27 months made &quot;a take it or leave it&quot; offer of\n\n₹7.16 crores towards full and final settlement of their claim.\n\nDicitex stated that it had taken a loan of a substantial amount\n\nand had to bear the extra burden of high interest and found itself\n\ndefaulting on timely loan repayments. It was further submitted\n\nthat Dicitex was unable to pay income tax on time, as a result of\n\nwhich, it had to pay a sum of ₹23.90 lacs in the year 2012­2013\n\nand a sum of ₹11.10 lakhs in the year 2013­2014 towards\n\ninterest for the delayed payments of income tax. It was also\n\nargued, on behalf of Dicitex, that it was subjected to economic\n\nduress and coercion which resulted in the signing of the\n\ndischarge voucher, which could not preclude its invocation of the\n\narbitration agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.   The appellant resisted the application, contending that\n\nDicitex had not demonstrated whether the second discharge\n\nvoucher signed by it was under economical or financial duress\n\nunder the arbitration agreement. It was urged that since Dicitex\n\nhad signed the discharge voucher and accepted the payment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                13</span>\n\nmade by the respondents unconditionally and confirmed that the\n\nsaid payment was received in full and final settlement of their\n\nclaim, present or future, arising directly/indirectly in respect of\n\nthe said loss/accident and subrogated all their rights and\n\nremedies to the appellant in respect of the loss/damages, there\n\nexists no dispute between the parties which can be referred to\n\narbitration. It was argued that Dicitex having signed the\n\ndischarge voucher for ₹7,16,30,148/­ in full and final settlement\n\ndue to alleged loss suffered by Dicitex, the arbitration application\n\nwas not maintainable. It was submitted that the appellant had\n\nreplied to the letter dated 21.06.2014 stating that Dicitex had\n\nwithdrawn only discharge voucher dated 31.05.2014. The\n\nappellant also stated that in the arbitration agreement itself,\n\nDicitex had to explain the exact correctness of the allegation of\n\ncoercion and duress with details and particulars about signing\n\nthe discharge voucher. It was further contended that though the\n\npayment was received by Dicitex on 09.06.2014, it raised protest\n\nonly on 21.06.2014. Even in the letter dated 21st June 2014,\n\nDicitex referred to the discharge voucher dated 31.05.2014 which\n\nwas not admittedly acted upon by the insurer. Dicitex did not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                 14</span>\n\nresile from the discharge voucher dated 31.05.2014, and thus on\n\nthat ground also, this arbitration application is not maintainable.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19604233\" id=\"span_18\">8.   The appellant relied on some decisions of this court (<a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_3\">New\n\nIndian Assurance Co. Ltd v Genus Power Infrastructure Ltd.</a> (2015)\n\n2 SCC 424.</span>       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1682326\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_20\"><a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_4\">National Insurance Co.

It was noted that a perusal of the\n\ncorrespondence prima facie indicated that the first surveyor\n\nappointed by the insurer had recommended the payment of more\n\nthan ₹12 crores in favour of Dicitex. For some reasons, the\n\nappellant did not accept the said report submitted by their own\n\nsurveyor   and    instead   appointed   M/s   Naveen   Jhand   and\n\nAssociates to re­compute the costings. It was also held that\n\nDicitex had furnished more than 37,700 documents to the\n\nsurveyor for their appraisal for submitting the report. Dicitex had\n\nplaced on record from time to time, documents to show that it\n\nhad taken loans from the banks who were pressurising it for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                               15</span>\n\nrepayment of those loans and interest. The account of Dicitex\n\nwith those banks had drawn the excess amount. The final\n\namount was sanctioned by the respondents only after 27 months\n\nof the fire having taken place, which caused loss to Dicitex.\n\nDicitex had produced about 11 letters addressed by the banks to\n\nDicitex, calling upon Dicitex to regularize their bank accounts\n\nand showing the excess amount drawn by it in various accounts.\n\nDicitex had also placed on record, the conduct of the second\n\nsurveyor, who was, according to it, demanding several other\n\ndocuments which were unwarranted and/or already submitted\n\nby it. The learned judge noticed that prima facie, Dicitex was\n\nfacing financial distress and economical duress and in view of its\n\nvarious urgent business liabilities, it apparently signed the said\n\ndischarge voucher reluctantly. It is not in dispute that the\n\nappellant refused to accept such discharge voucher signed by\n\nDicitex with letter of protest. Therefore, a few days later, a\n\ndischarge voucher was signed by Dicitex. It was, however,\n\nDicitex’s case that the appellant had insisted upon it to sign a\n\nclean discharge voucher and to withdraw the letter of protest\n\naddressed by it, failing which, the insurer would not release the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                16</span>\n\namount, even that was reflected in the discharge voucher. Dicitex\n\nthereafter withdrew the letter dated 31.05.2014, and signed\n\nanother discharge voucher. After signing another discharge\n\nvoucher, Dicitex placed on record their objection that the same\n\nwas signed due to pressure of the respondents.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">10.

On perusal of the large number of\n          correspondence exchanged between Dicitex and\n          the respondents which were not disputed by the\n          respondents, in my prima facie view, it indicates\n          that Dicitex was facing the financial constraint\n          and economical and financial duress on the part\n          of the respondents in not sanctioning and paying\n          the final claim for 27 months from the date of fire.\n          Dicitex having faced pressure from their bankers\n          and suffering from other business liabilities\n          including the demand of income tax department,\n          Dicitex was under the economical and financial\n          duress and the said discharge voucher thus, in\n          my prima facie view, cannot be considered as an\n          unconditional discharge voucher thereby Dicitex\n          giving up their claim in future arising out of the\n          said discharge voucher.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          58. In my view, if Dicitex would not have signed\n          such discharge voucher acknowledging the\n          payment of the lesser amount than what was\n          alleged to be due to Dicitex after 27 months of the\n          loss suffered, the respondents would not have\n          released even the said amount mentioned in the\n          discharge voucher. In my view, if according to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                      17</span>\n\nrespondents, Dicitex was not entitled to recover\nthe amount as claimed by Dicitex, but the lesser\namount, the respondents could have released the\namount as payable according to the respondents,\nbut could not have insisted for execution of a\ndischarge voucher as a pre­condition before\nreleasing such payment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">59. Learned counsel for the respondents could not\nrefer to any provision in the insurance policy or\nany other provision of law in support of their claim\nthat the respondents were entitled to insist for\nexecution of such discharge voucher before\nreleasing any payment in favour of Dicitex with a\nconfirmation not to make any claim in future\narising out of the said claim. The Supreme Court\nhas already deprecated the practice followed by\nthe     government       departments,      statutory\ncorporations and government companies for\nobtaining such undated discharge voucher as the\ncondition for releasing lesser amount and has\nheld that the said procedure is unfair, irregular\nand illegal. Though the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate is empowered to decide the issue as to\nwhether the parties had concluded the contract by\nrecording satisfaction of their mutual rights and\nobligations thereby receiving the final payment\nwithout objection based on the affidavits and the\npleadings or can leave the said issue to be\ndecided by the arbitral tribunal, in my view, it\nwould be appropriate if the issue raised by the\nrespondents that Dicitex had signed such\ndischarge voucher unconditionally and the issue\nraised by Dicitex that the same was under duress\nand coercion is conclusively decided by the\narbitral tribunal and if necessary, by leading oral\nevidence.

Counsel for Dicitex urges that this court should not\n\n      interfere with the impugned judgment. It was urged that the\n\n      material in the form of the record, particularly the\n\n      consistent trend of letters, prior to the letter of 06.06.2014\n\n      as well as the correspondence after that, clearly reveal that\n\n      Dicitex was undergoing severe financial crisis and that the\n\n      prolonged process of settlement claim constrained it to issue\n\n      the said letter of 06.06.2014. However, the fact remained\n\n      that at the relevant time, it faced a crisis of existence. Its\n\n      acceptance    was     under        financial   compulsion   which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                 20</span>\n\n      amounted to economic coercion.

The main theme of the appellant’s argument in this\n\n      case is that Dicitex could not have invoked the arbitration\n\n      clause, since it had fully and finally accepted the amount\n\n      offered (i.e..) and withdrawn its protests and reservations,\n\n      by the letter dated 06.06.2014. It cites the decisions in\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_9\">Boghara Polyfab, Master Construction and Genus Power</a>\n\n      (supra) in this regard.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">14.         The issue of the court’s jurisdiction to examine\n\n      whether a dispute is arbitrable, in the context of no\n\n      objection certificates or discharge vouchers, was examined\n\n      in Boghara Polyfab for the first time. This court in the\n\n      context of an application under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11(6)</a> dealt with the\n\n      issue, holding that if there was accord and satisfaction due\n\n      to a no dues certificate, a reference under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> was\n\n      not maintainable.

Let us consider what a civil court would have\ndone in a case where the defendant puts forth the\ndefence of accord and satisfaction on the basis of\na full and final discharge voucher issued by the\nplaintiff, and the plaintiff alleges that it was\nobtained by fraud/coercion/undue influence and\ntherefore not valid. It would consider the evidence\nas to whether there was any fraud, coercion or\nundue influence. If it found that there was none, it\nwill accept the voucher as being in discharge of\nthe contract and reject the claim without\nexamining the claim on merits. On the other hand,\nif it found that the discharge voucher had been\nobtained by fraud/undue influence/coercion, it\nwill ignore the same, examine whether the\nplaintiff had made out the claim on merits and\ndecide the matter accordingly. The position will be\nthe same even when there is a provision for\narbitration.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">52. Some illustrations (not exhaustive) as to when\nclaims are arbitrable and when they are not,\nwhen discharge of contract by accord and\nsatisfaction are disputed, to round up the\ndiscussion on this subject:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(i) A claim is referred to a conciliation or a pre­\nlitigation Lok Adalat. The parties negotiate and\narrive at a settlement. The terms of settlement are\ndrawn up and signed by both the parties and\nattested by the Conciliator or the members of the\nLok Adalat. After settlement by way of accord and\nsatisfaction, there can be no reference to\narbitration.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(ii) A claimant makes several claims. The admitted\nor undisputed claims are paid. Thereafter\nnegotiations are held for settlement of the\ndisputed claims resulting in an agreement in\nwriting settling all the pending claims and\ndisputes. On such settlement, the amount agreed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                       22</span>\n\nis paid and the contractor also issues a discharge\nvoucher/no claim certificate/full and final receipt.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">After the contract is discharged by such accord\nand satisfaction, neither the contract nor any\ndispute survives for consideration. There cannot\nbe any reference of any dispute to arbitration\nthereafter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">(iii) A contractor executes the work and claims\npayment of say Rupees Ten Lakhs as due in\nterms of the contract. The employer admits the\nclaim only for Rupees six lakhs and informs the\ncontractor either in writing or orally that unless\nthe contractor gives a discharge voucher in the\nprescribed format acknowledging receipt of\nRupees Six Lakhs in full and final satisfaction of\nthe contract, payment of the admitted amount will\nnot be released. The contractor who is hard\npressed for funds and keen to get the admitted\namount released, signs on the dotted line either in\na printed form or otherwise, stating that the\namount is received in full and final settlement. In\nsuch a case, the discharge is under economic\nduress on account of coercion employed by the\nemployer. Obviously, the discharge voucher\ncannot be considered to be voluntary or as having\nresulted in discharge of the contract by accord\nand satisfaction. It will not be a bar to arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">(iv) An insured makes a claim for loss suffered.\nThe claim is neither admitted nor rejected. But the\ninsured is informed during discussions that\nunless the claimant gives a full and final voucher\nfor a specified amount (far lesser than the amount\nclaimed by the insured), the entire claim will be\nrejected. Being in financial difficulties, the\nclaimant agrees to the demand and issues an\nundated discharge voucher in full and final\nsettlement. Only a few days thereafter, the\nadmitted amount mentioned in the voucher is\npaid. The accord and satisfaction in such a case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                 23</span>\n\n           is not voluntary but under duress, compulsion and\n           coercion. The coercion is subtle, but very much\n           real. The `accord&#x27; is not by free consent. The\n           arbitration agreement can thus be invoked to refer\n           the disputes to arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">           (v) A claimant makes a claim for a huge sum, by\n           way of damages. The respondent disputes the\n           claim. The claimant who is keen to have a\n           settlement and avoid litigation, voluntarily\n           reduces the claim and requests for settlement. The\n           respondent agrees and settles the claim and\n           obtains a full and final discharge voucher. Here\n           even if the claimant might have agreed for\n           settlement due to financial compulsions and\n           commercial pressure or economic duress, the\n           decision was his free choice. There was no threat,\n           coercion or compulsion by the respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">           Therefore, the accord and satisfaction is binding\n           and valid and there cannot be any subsequent\n           claim or reference to arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">           52. Let us now examine the receipt that has been\n           taken in this case. It is undated and is in a pro\n           forma furnished by the appellant containing\n           irrelevant and inappropriate statements. It states:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           &quot;I/we hereby assign to the company, my/our right\n           to the affected property stolen which shall, in the\n           event of their recovery, be the property of the\n           company&quot;. The claim was not in regard to theft of\n           any property nor was the claim being settled in\n           respect of a theft claim. We are referring to this\n           aspect only to show how claimants are required to\n           sign on the dotted line, and how such vouchers\n           are insisted and taken mechanically without\n           application of mind.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">15.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1682326\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/1682326/\" id=\"a_12\">Master Construction</a> (supra), this Court held that:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                      24</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;20. The Bench in Boghara Polyfab Private Limited\nin paragraphs 42 and 43, with reference to the\ncases cited before it, inter alia, noted that there\nwere two categories of the cited cases; (one)\nwhere the Court after considering the facts found\nthat there was a full and final settlement resulting\nin accord and satisfaction, and there was no\nsubstance in the allegations of coercion/undue\ninfluence and, consequently, it was held that\nthere could be no reference of any dispute to\narbitration and (two) where the court found some\nsubstance in the contention of the claimants that\n`no dues/claim certificates&#x27; or `full and final\nsettlement discharge vouchers&#x27; were insisted and\ntaken (either in printed format or otherwise) as a\ncondition precedent for release of the admitted\ndues and thereby giving rise to an arbitrable\ndispute.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">21. In Boghara Polyfab Private Limited, the\nconsequences of discharge of the contract were\nalso considered. In para 25 (page 284), it was\nexplained that when a contract has been fully\nperformed, then there is a discharge of the\ncontract by performance and the contract comes to\nan end and in regard to such a discharged\ncontract, nothing remains and there cannot be any\ndispute and, consequently, there cannot be\nreference to arbitration of any dispute arising from\na discharged contract. It was held that the\nquestion whether the contract has been\ndischarged by performance or not is a mixed\nquestion of fact and law, and if there is a dispute\nin regard to that question, such question is\narbitrable. The Court, however, noted an exception\nto this proposition. The exception noticed is that\nwhere both the parties to a contract confirm in\nwriting that the contract has been fully and finally\ndischarged by performance of all obligations and\nthere are no outstanding claims or disputes,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                      25</span>\n\ncourts will not refer any subsequent claim or\ndispute to arbitration. Yet another exception noted\ntherein is with regard to those cases where one of\nthe parties to the contract issues a full and final\ndischarge voucher (or no­dues certificate, as the\ncase may be) confirming that he has received the\npayment in full and final satisfaction of all claims,\nand he has no outstanding claim. It was observed\nthat issuance of full and final discharge voucher\nor no­dues certificate of that kind amounts to\ndischarge of the contract by acceptance or\nperformance and the party issuing the discharge\nvoucher/certificate cannot thereafter make any\nfresh claim or revive any settled claim nor can it\nseek reference to arbitration in respect of any\nclaim.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">22. In paragraph 26 (pages 284­285), this Court in\nBoghara Polyfab Private Limited held that if a\nparty which has executed the discharge\nagreement or discharge voucher, alleges that the\nexecution of such document was on account of\nfraud/coercion/undue influence practiced by the\nother party, and if that party establishes the\nsame, then such discharge voucher or agreement\nis rendered void and cannot be acted upon and\nconsequently, any dispute raised by such party\nwould be arbitrable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">23. In paragraph 24 (page 284) in Boghara\nPolyfab Private Limited, this Court held that a\nclaim for arbitration cannot be rejected merely or\nsolely on the ground that a settlement agreement\nor discharge voucher has been executed by the\nclaimant. The Court stated that such dispute will\nhave to be decided by the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate in the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 11</a> of\nthe 1996 Act or by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">24. In our opinion, there is no rule of the absolute\nkind. In a case where the claimant contends that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                   26</span>\n\n          a discharge voucher or no­claim certificate has\n          been obtained by fraud, coercion, duress or undue\n          influence and the other side contests the\n          correctness thereof, the Chief Justice/his\n          designate must look into this aspect to find out at\n          least, prima facie, whether or not the dispute is\n          bona fide and genuine. Where the dispute raised\n          by the claimant with regard to validity of the\n          discharge voucher or no­claim certificate or\n          settlement agreement, prima facie, appears to be\n          lacking in credibility, there may not be necessity\n          to refer the dispute for arbitration at all. It cannot\n          be overlooked that the cost of arbitration is quite\n          huge ­ most of the time, it runs in six and seven\n          figures. It may not be proper to burden a party,\n          who contends that the dispute is not arbitrable on\n          account of discharge of contract, with huge cost of\n          arbitration merely because plea of fraud, coercion,\n          duress or undue influence has been taken by the\n          claimant. A bald plea of fraud, coercion, duress or\n          undue influence is not enough and the party who\n          sets up such plea must prima facie establish the\n          same by placing material before the Chief\n          Justice/his designate. If the Chief Justice/his\n          designate finds some merit in the allegation of\n          fraud, coercion, duress or undue influence, he\n          may decide the same or leave it to be decided by\n          the Arbitral Tribunal. On the other hand, if such\n          plea is found to be an after­thought, make­believe\n          or lacking in credibility, the matter must be set at\n          rest then and there.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">16.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19604233\" id=\"span_37\">In <a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_14\">Genus Power</a> (supra), the relevant observations of\n      this court are as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">          &quot;8. It is therefore clear that a bald plea of fraud,\n          coercion, duress or undue influence is not enough\n          and the party who sets up a plea, must prime\n          facie establish the same by placing material\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                       27</span>\n\nbefore the Chief Justice/his designate. Viewed\nthus, the relevant averments in the petition filed\nby the Respondent need to be considered, which\nwere to the following effect:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      **************           *************\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(g) That the said surveyor, in connivance with the\nRespondent Company, in order to make the\nRespondent Company escape its full liability of\ncompensating the Petitioner of such huge loss,\nacted in a biased manner, adopted coercion\nundue influence and duress methods of assessing\nthe loss and forced the Petitioner to sign certain\ndocuments including the Claim Form. The\nRespondent Company also denied the just claim\nof the Petitioner by their acts of omission and\ncommission and by exercising coercion and undue\ninfluence and made the Petitioner Company sign\ncertain documents, including a pre­prepared\ndischarge voucher for the said amount in\nadvance, which the Petitioner Company were\nforced to do so in the period of extreme financial\ndifficulty which prevailed during the said period.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">As stated aforesaid, the Petitioner Company was\nforced to sign several documents including a letter\naccepting the loss amounting to Rs. 6,09,55,406/­\nand settle the claim of Rs. 5,96,08,179/­ as\nagainst the actual loss amount of Rs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">28,79,08,116/­ against the interest of the\nPetitioner company. The said letter and the\naforesaid pre­prepared discharge voucher stated\nthat the Petitioner had accepted the claim amount\nin full and final settlement and thus, forced the\nPetitioner company to unilateral acceptance the\nsame. The Petitioner company was forced to sign\nthe said document under duress and coercion by\nthe Respondent Company. The Respondent\nCompany further threatened the Petitioner\nCompany to accept the said amount in full and\nfinal or the Respondent Company will not pay any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                           28</span>\n\n      amount toward the fire policy. It was under such\n      compelling circumstances that the Petitioner\n      company was forced and under duress was made\n      to sign the acceptance letter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">      9. In our considered view, the plea raised by the\n      Respondent is bereft of any details and\n      particulars, and cannot be anything but a bald\n      assertion. Given the fact that there was no protest\n      or demur raised around the time or soon after the\n      letter of subrogation was signed, that the notice\n      dated 31.03.2011 itself was nearly after three\n      weeks and that the financial condition of the\n      Respondent was not so precarious that it was left\n      with no alternative but to accept the terms as\n      suggested, we are of the firm view that the\n      discharge in the present case and signing of letter\n      of subrogation were not because of exercise of any\n      undue influence. Such discharge and signing of\n      letter of subrogation was voluntary and free from\n      any coercion or undue influence. In the\n      circumstances, we hold that upon execution of the\n      letter of subrogation, there was full and final\n      settlement of the claim. Since our answer to the\n      question, whether there was really accord and\n      satisfaction, is in the affirmative, in our view no\n      arbitrable dispute existed so as to exercise power\n      Under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 11</a> of the Act. The High Court was\n      not therefore justified in exercising power Under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a> of the Act.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">17.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132946291\" id=\"span_41\">In <a href=\"/doc/132946291/\" id=\"a_17\">Velugubanti Hari Babu v.

From the materials on record, we find that the\n     contractee­ Company had issued the &quot;No Dues/No\n     Claim Certificate&quot; on 21.09.2012, it had received\n     the full amount of the final bill being Rs. 20.34\n     crores on 10.10.2012 and after 12 days\n     thereafter, i.e., only on 24.10.2012, the\n     contractee­Company       withdrew     letter   dated\n     21.09.2012      issuing    &quot;No    Dues/No      Claim\n     Certificate&quot;. Apart from it, we also find that the\n     Final Bill has been mutually signed by both the\n     parties to the Contract accepting the quantum of\n     work done, conducting final measurements as per\n     the Contract, arriving at final value of work, the\n     payments made and the final payment that was\n     required to be made. The contractee­Company\n     accepted the final payment in full and final\n     satisfaction of all its claims. We are of the\n     considered opinion that in the presents facts and\n     circumstances, the raising of the Final Bill and\n     mutual agreement of the parties in that regard, all\n     claims, rights and obligation of the parties merge\n     with the Final Bill and nothing further remains to\n     be done. Further, the Appellant­Contractor issued\n     the Completion Certificate dated 19.06.2013\n     pursuant to which the Appellant­Contractor has\n     been discharged of all the liabilities. With regard\n     to the issue that the &quot;No­Dues Certificate&quot; had\n     been given under duress and coercion, we are of\n     the opinion that there is nothing on record to prove\n     that the said Certificate had been given under\n     duress or coercion and as the Certificate itself\n     provided a clearance of no dues, the contractee\n     could not now turn around and say that any\n     further payment was still due on account of the\n     losses incurred during the execution of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                      30</span>\n\nContract. The story about duress was an\nafterthought in the background that the losses\nincurred during the execution of the Contract were\nnot visualised earlier by the contractee. As to\nfinancial duress or coercion, nothing of this kind is\nestablished prima facie. Mere allegation that no­\nclaim certificates have been obtained under\nfinancial duress and coercion, without there being\nanything more to suggest that, does not lead to an\narbitrable dispute. The conduct of the contractee\nclearly shows that &quot;no­claim certificate&quot; was given\nby it voluntarily; the contractee accepted the\namount voluntarily and the contract was\ndischarged voluntarily.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">Conclusion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">25.    Admittedly,     No­Dues    Certificate   was\nsubmitted by the contractee­Company on\n21.09.2012 and on their request Completion\nCertificate was issued by the Appellant­\nContractor. The contractee, after a gap of one\nmonth, that is, on 24.10.2012, withdrew the No\nDues Certificate on the grounds of coercion and\nduress and the claim for losses incurred during\nexecution of the Contract site was made vide letter\ndated 12.01.2013, i.e., after a gap of 3 1/2 (three\nand a half) months whereas the Final Bill was\nsettled on 10.10.2012. When the contractee\naccepted the final payment in full and final\nsatisfaction of all its claims, there is no point in\nraising the claim for losses incurred during the\nexecution of the Contract at a belated stage which\ncreates an iota of doubt as to why such claim was\nnot settled at the time of submitting Final Bills\nthat too in the absence of exercising duress or\ncoercion on the Contractee by the Appellant­\nContractor. In our considered view, the plea raised\nby the contractee­Company is bereft of any details\nand particulars, and cannot be anything but a\nbald assertion. In the circumstances, there was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                31</span>\n\n          full and final settlement of the claim and there\n          was really accord and satisfaction and in our\n          view no arbitrable dispute existed so as to\n          exercise power Under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 11</a> of the Act. The\n          High Court was not, therefore, justified in\n          exercising power Under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a> of the Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_46\">18.        It is clear that in <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_22\">Boghara Polyfab</a> (supra), no rule of\n\n      universal application was indicated. No doubt, subsequent\n\n      judgments which followed it, were in the context of the\n\n      facts as were presented to the court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_47\">Proposition (iii) of the\n\n      conclusions recorded in <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_23\">Boghara Polyfab</a> (supra) visualize\n\n      duress or coercion on account of withholding of payments\n\n      due. The court – in more places than one, recognized that\n\n      an aggrieved party can be the victim of economic coercion\n\n      which results in its signing a document which discharges\n\n      the other party of its obligations.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1682326\" id=\"span_48\"><a href=\"/doc/1682326/\" id=\"a_24\">Master Construction</a>\n\n      (supra) placed the matter in perspective, when the court\n\n      enunciated the principle in the following terms:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19604233\" id=\"span_49\">“In our opinion, there is no rule of the absolute\n          kind. In a case where the claimant contends that\n          a discharge voucher or no­claim certificate has\n          been obtained by fraud, coercion, duress or undue\n          influence and the other side contests the\n          correctness thereof, the Chief Justice/his\n          designate must look into this aspect to find out at\n          least, prima facie, whether or not the dispute is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                     32</span>\n\n           bona fide and genuine. Where the dispute raised\n           by the claimant with regard to validity of the\n           discharge voucher or no­claim certificate or\n           settlement agreement, prima facie, appears to be\n           lacking in credibility, there may not be necessity\n           to refer the dispute for arbitration at all.”\n\n      Likewise, in <a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_25\">Genus Power</a> (supra), the court cautioned that a\n\n      “bald plea” of coercion, without any supporting material is\n\n      insufficient for a court to hold that the accord/satisfaction\n\n      or no dues certificate was involuntarily given.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">19.         A close look at the facts in the present case would\n\n      show that though the pleadings in the initial application\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11(6)</a> are weak, nevertheless, the materials\n\n      on the record, in the form of copies of the inter se\n\n      correspondence of the parties – which span over 2 years,\n\n      clearly show that Dicitex kept repeatedly stating that it was\n\n      facing financial crisis; it referred to credits obtained for its\n\n      business and the urgency to pay back the bank. It is a\n\n      matter    of   record   that    the   Surveyor’s   report,   dated\n\n      14.08.2014, recommended payment of ₹12,93,26,704.98/­\n\n      to Dicitex. Equally, it is a matter of record that the\n\n      appellant referred the matter to a chartered accountant’s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                  33</span>\n\n      firm, to verify certain inventory and sales figures. It went\n\n      by the report of the latter, who stated that the estimate of\n\n      loss could not be more than ₹7,16,30,148/­. This is what\n\n      was offered to Dicitex, by May, 2014. Dicitex’s application\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 11(6)</a> is replete with references to the\n\n      number of letters written to the appellant, seeking release\n\n      of amounts; it also averred to inability to pay its income tax\n\n      dues, the pressure from bankers (in support of which,\n\n      copies of letters of bankers were produced along with the\n\n      application).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">20.        The        averments   by   Dicitex,    regarding    the\n\n      circumstances which led it to execute the no objection\n\n      discharge voucher, are reproduced below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">           “31. The Respondents did not pay anything to\n           the Petitioner after the submission of its letter,\n           dated 31st May, 2014 and the submission of its\n           letter, dated 31st May, 2014 and therefore\n           several telephonic calls were made on behalf of\n           the Petitioner, to the Respondent’s Regional\n           Office at Mumbai in an effort to persuade the\n           Respondents to increase the settlement amount\n           so as to include the differential amount of about\n           Rs. 7 crores. The Petitioner also specifically\n           requested the Respondents not to, in any event,\n           insist on the execution of the Discharge Voucher\n           strictly as prescribed as a condition precedent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                 34</span>\n\n            for the payment of any part of the balance\n            amount of claim.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">            32. Since, on the one hand, the Respondents\n            did not show any inclination to relent on any\n            count and instead continued to insist continued\n            to insist that any further payment would be\n            made to the Petitioner if and only if the\n            Discharge Voucher was executed exactly at the\n            time and in the form and manner as required by\n            the Respondents as well as the letter dated 31 st\n            May, 2014 withdrawn and, on the other hand,\n            the Petitioner was in urgent need of funds to\n            meet its mounting liabilities the Petitioner was\n            forced to withdraw its earlier letter dated 31 st\n            May, 2014 and coerced into executing the\n            Discharge Voucher exactly as dictated by the\n            Respondents. Accordingly, the Petitioner wrote a\n            letter dated 6th June, 2014 to the Respondent No.\n            2 stating therein that it was withdrawing its\n            letter dated 31st May, 2­14 and also enclosing\n            the duly executed discharge Voucher. The\n            Petitioner also requested that the claim amount\n            be paid over to it, immediately.”\n\n     The averments in the application, later are that the\n\nappellant paid the amount. Dicitex, nevertheless later, by three\n\nletters questioned the basis of reduction of the amount of claim.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">It later alleged that it wrote a letter “dated 14th July, 2014 to the\n\nrespondents stating therein, inter alia, that since they were forced\n\nto accept the offered amount and that since there was a dispute on\n\nthe quantum of claim settlement paid to the Petitioner, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                    35</span>\n\nPetitioner was invoking arbitration proceedings under Clause 13 of\n\nthe said Policy to recover the differential amount.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1619594\" id=\"span_55\">21.        An overall reading of Dicitex’s application (under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 11(6)</a>) clearly shows that its grievance with respect to the\n\ninvoluntary nature of the discharge voucher was articulated. It\n\ncannot be disputed, that several letters – spanning over two\n\nyears­ stating that it was facing financial crisis on account of the\n\ndelay in settling the claim, were addressed to the appellant. This\n\ncourt is conscious of the fact that an application under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n11(6)</a> is in the form of a pleading which merely seeks an order of\n\nthe court, for appointment of an arbitrator. It cannot be\n\nconclusive of the pleas or contentions that the claimant or the\n\nconcerned party can take, in the arbitral proceedings. At this\n\nstage, therefore, the court­ which is required to ensure that an\n\narbitrable dispute exists, has to be prima facie convinced about\n\nthe genuineness or credibility of the plea of coercion; it cannot be\n\ntoo particular about the nature of the plea, which necessarily has\n\nto be made and established in the substantive (read: arbitration)\n\nproceeding. If the court were to take a contrary approach and\n\nminutely   examine     the   plea    and   judge   its   credibility   or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                36</span>\n\nreasonableness, there would be a danger of its denying a forum\n\nto the applicant altogether, because rejection of the application\n\nwould render the finding (about the finality of the discharge and\n\nits effect as satisfaction) final, thus, precluding the applicant of\n\nits right event to approach a civil court. There are decisions of\n\nthis court (<a href=\"/doc/1619594/\" id=\"a_30\">Associated Construction v Pawanhans Helicopters\n\nLtd.</a> (2008) 16 <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_31\">SCC 128 and Boghara Polyfab</a> (supra) upheld the\n\nconcept of economic duress. Having regard to the facts and\n\ncircumstances, this court is of the opinion that the reasoning in\n\nthe impugned judgment cannot be faulted.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">22.
