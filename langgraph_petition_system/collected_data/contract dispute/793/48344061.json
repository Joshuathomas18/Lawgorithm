Mr Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel appearing for MIAL\n                          assailed the impugned award on, essentially, six fronts. First, he\n                          submitted that the impugned award failed to take into consideration\n                          the vital terms of their contract including <a href=\"/doc/153520/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 5.2(b)(i)</a> of the\n                          OMDA, which provided for transfer of all existing contracts and\n                          agreements. The claim was to enforce obligations in terms of OMDA\n                          and was therefore, arbitrable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">                          30.    Second, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had failed to\n                          appreciate that no relief was claimed against HCI but only a direction\n                          was sought against AAI to transfer its interest in respect of the HCI\n                          Lease Agreement in terms of <a href=\"/doc/313824/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 109</a> of the Transfer of Property\n                          Act, 1882 (hereafter &#x27;TPA&#x27;) and for such a transfer, no consent of the\n                          Lessee was required.

Third, he submitted that Clause 24 of the HCI Lease Agreement\n                          could in no way be construed as a &#x27;contract to the contrary&#x27; as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">By:Dushyant Rawal         O.M.P.

Fourth, he submitted that the finding of Justice (Retd.) R.C.\n                          Lahoti that an &#x27;Existing Lease&#x27; was a &#x27;Carved Out Asset&#x27; is patently\n                          erroneous and contrary to the definition of the terms &#x27;Existing Leases&#x27;\n                          and &#x27;Carved Out Assets&#x27; under OMDA.

Fifth, he submitted that the impugned award ignored <a href=\"/doc/286859/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 40</a>\n                          of the AAI Act in terms of which, the Government of India could issue\n                          directions, which were binding upon the AAI. Thus, the directions\n                          issued for the transfer of the HCI Lease Agreement to MIAL, was\n                          binding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1049947\" id=\"span_37\">34.      Lastly, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal wrongly relied\n                          upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1049947/\" id=\"a_12\">Mumbai International\n                          Airport (P) Ltd. v Regency Convention Centre and Hotels Pvt.

In that case, there was a pre-existing dispute\n                          between AAI and the Lessee. A civil suit was pending when the\n                          Operation Management Development Agreement was executed and\n                          MIAL had sought impleadment in that suit. This was denied, as the\n                          Court found that MIAL had not acquired any interest in the leased\n                          property.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"176001832\" id=\"span_38\">He further contended that, the decision of the Supreme Court\n                          in <a href=\"/doc/176001832/\" id=\"a_14\">Raghubir Buildcon Pvt.

Thakker\n                          had found that the HCI Lease Agreement was in existence and\n                          operative prior to the parties entering into the OMDA and therefore,\n                          under Article 2.6.1 of the OMDA, the &#x27;Existing Leases&#x27; (which\n                          included the HCI Lease Agreement) were excluded from the scope of\n                          &#x27;Demised Premises&#x27; under the OMDA. He stated that the Arbitral\n                          Tribunal had concluded that it had jurisdiction only in respect of\n                          matters that arose out of or in relation to the OMDA and could not\n                          travel outside the scope of the said contract.       Consequently, the\n                          Arbitral Tribunal found that any dispute relating to the HCI Lease\n                          Agreement, which fell outside the purview of the OMDA could not be\n                          adjudicated in arbitral proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 15.2</a> of the OMDA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1049947\" id=\"span_43\">36.

At the outset it is relevant to note that all the three members of\n                          the Arbitral Tribunal concurred that Claim nos.2, 3 and 4 of MIAL\n                          could not be entertained as the HCI was not a party to the arbitral\n                          proceedings and the said claims pertain to exercise of rights under the\n                          HCI Lease Agreement. However, the members of the Arbitral\n                          Tribunal entered differing opinions in connection with Claim no.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                          42.    The principal issue raised before the Arbitral Tribunal was\n                          whether the claims raised by MIAL were arbitrable. In this regard, the\n                          members of the Arbitral Tribunal entered differing opinions. Justice\n                          (Retd.) Mohit S. Shah held in favour of MIAL. According to him,\n                          MIAL&#x27;s Claim no.1 was arbitrable and MIAL was entitled to a\n                          declaration that AAI was obliged to transfer/assign its rights as the\n                          Lessor under the HCI Lease Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                          43.    Justice (Retd.) C.K. Thakker, expressed a different view. He\n                          held that MIAL&#x27;s Claim no.1 was not arbitrable and therefore, the\n                          other points of determination as framed by the Arbitral Tribunal did\n                          not survive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">                          44.

However, he also\n                          indicated his reasons for the same. There is a controversy with regard\n                          to his concurring opinion as the reasons articulated by him are\n                          somewhat different to the reasons as mentioned by Justice (Retd.)\n                          C.K. Thakker.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                          45.    According to AAI, Justice (Retd.) C.K. Thakker&#x27;s opinion must\n                          be considered as the operative award. This Court accepts this\n                          contention as Justice (Retd.) R.C. Lahoti had clearly expressed that he\n                          concurred with the draft award circulated by Justice (Retd.) C.K.\n                          Thakker.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">                          46.    The principal question to be addressed is whether the decision\n                          that MIAL&#x27;s Claim no.1 is not arbitrable, is patently erroneous and the\n                          impugned award is vitiated by patent illegality on that ground.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">                          47.    At this stage, it would be relevant to briefly indicate the claims\n                          made by MIAL. MIAL claimed that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/153520/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 5.2(b)(i)</a> of\n                          the OMDA, AAI was required to transfer / novate the existing\n                          contracts and agreements including the HCI Lease Agreement in its\n                          favour within a period of three months from the effective date. MIAL\n                          claimed that it had on, several occasions called upon AAI to do so.\n                          Further, MoCA had also conveyed the legal opinion of the MoLJ on\n                          the said issue. MIAL claimed that it was entitled to a declaration that\n                          AAI was required to transfer / novate HCI&#x27;s Lease Agreement in its\n                          favour under various covenants of the OMDA (Claim no.1). It also\n                          prayed for a direction to AAI to terminate the HCI Lease Agreement\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">By:Dushyant Rawal         O.M.P.

Further, it claimed that AAI was liable to pay the\n                          land rent as per the invoices for the land leased to HCI, amounting to\n                          ₹7,46,45,436/- (Claim no.3). MIAL states that HCI was liable to pay\n                          2% of the turnover or the Minimum Guarantee Amount, whichever\n                          was higher and, it was entitled to recover the said amount from AAI\n                          (Claim no.4). In addition, MIAL also prayed for costs (Claim no.5).\n                          AAI countered the aforesaid claims and also raised a preliminary\n                          objection as to the maintainability of the claims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">                          48.

MIAL failed to do this at\n                                  the relevant time, i.e. during the Transition Phase, and is\n                                  now belatedly seeking orders directing novation which, by\n                                  their very nature, cannot be passed without HCI being a\n                                  party.

He\n                          observed that MIAL&#x27;s Claim No.1 arises under the OMDA and\n                          therefore, rejected the contention that Claim no.1 was not arbitrable as\n                          HCI was not a party to the arbitral proceedings.           The learned\n                          Arbitrator further held that Section 109 of the TPA permitted a Lessor\n                          to transfer its rights to a third party without requiring the consent of\n                          the lessor.

The learned Presiding Arbitrator [Justice (Retd.) R.C.

It is palpable that the reasons that persuaded the learned\n                          Arbitrator, Justice (Retd.) C.K. Thakker, to hold that the disputes were\n                          not arbitrable may be relevant for adjudication of the question whether\n                          AAI was required to transfer the HCI Lease Agreement under the\n                          OMDA. The HCI Lease Agreement was an Existing Lease and\n                          therefore, the majority had held that disputes arising in respect of the\n                          said lease were not arbitrable. If this reasoning is extended, it may be\n                          construed that MIAL had no right to seek transfer of the HCI Lease\n                          Agreement under <a href=\"/doc/153520/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 5.2(b)(i)</a> of the OMDA and therefore, its\n                          claim was unmerited. But that is a question that the Arbitral Tribunal\n                          was required to address.

The said decision was rendered by the Supreme Court in\n                          regard to MIAL&#x27;s plea to be impleaded in an action instituted by AAI\n                          in respect of a lease / licence. The Supreme Court had held that MIAL\n                          had no locus as it had no right, title or interest in the property and it\n                          could not seek impleadment as it was not a necessary or proper party\n                          in an action between AAI and a third party. In the present case, MIAL\n                          was not seeking any right, title or interest under the HCI Lease\n                          Agreement but it was seeking a declaration that AAI was obliged to\n                          transfer / novate the HCI Lease Agreement. The question of MIAL\n                          claiming any interest in the HCI Lease Agreement would arise only\n                          once AAI had transferred the same. The question whether AAI was\n                          obliged to do so was precisely the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"7627665\" id=\"span_163\">89.

In addition, contravention of\n                                      law not linked to public policy or public interest\n                                      is beyond the scope of the expression &quot;patent\n                                      illegality&quot;. What is prohibited is for Courts to\n                                      reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award\n                                      suffers from patent illegality appearing on the\n                                      face of the award, as Courts do not sit in appeal\n                                      against the arbitral award.

An arbitral award\n                                      stating no reasons for its findings would make\n                                      itself susceptible to challenge on this account.\n                                      The conclusions of the arbitrator which are based\n                                      on no evidence or have been arrived at by\n                                      ignoring vital evidence are perverse and can be\n                                      set aside on the ground of patent illegality.

In the present case, this Court is of the view that the impugned\n                          award does fall within the narrow scope where interference is\n                          permissible. This Court is of the view that the conclusion of the\n                          Arbitral Tribunal that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the\n                          question - &quot;(iii) Whether Respondent is mandated under OMDA to\n                          transfer / novate HCI Lease Agreement dated 21.03.2002 in favour of\n                          the Claimant?&quot; [Point no. 3] is ex facie erroneous and not a view that\n                          can be accepted as a plausible one.           The Arbitral Tribunal had\n                          declined to exercise the jurisdiction to address the aforesaid question,\n                          which strikes at the root of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">                          91.

This also included the right to\n                          &quot;regulate the use by the third party of the Airport&quot;. The learned\n                          Arbitrator was of the view that the expression &#x27;Airport&#x27; was not\n                          confined to only the Demised Premises leased to MIAL but would\n                          also include other areas if the context so demanded. It was obvious\n                          from certain clauses that the word &#x27;Airport&#x27; was not used in a limited\n                          sense. <a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_79\">Articles 5.1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1188180/\" id=\"a_80\">5.2</a> of the OMDA also use the expression &quot;as\n                          relatable to the Airport&quot;, which is wide and does not confine the\n                          matter to Demised Premises alone. The learned Arbitrator was of the\n                          view that since the HCI Lease Agreement was relatable to the Airport,\n                          it was required to be transferred / novated in favour of MIAL in terms\n                          of <a href=\"/doc/153520/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 5.2(b)</a> of OMDA.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98965625\" id=\"span_177\">93.    MIAL prays that the opinion of Justice (Retd.) Mohit Shah be\n                          accepted as an award in place of the majority opinion. This relief\n                          cannot be granted. This Court has not examined the dispute on merits\n                          as it is not required to do so. In any view this Court cannot supplant its\n                          view over that of the Arbitral Tribunal. The scope of examination in\n                          this case is limited to the question whether the conclusion that the\n                          dispute is not arbitrable is patently erroneous. The contention\n                          advanced on behalf of AAI that this Court cannot substitute or modify\n                          an Arbitral Award is merited.

The majority opinion (in this case the award penned down by\n                          Justice (Retd.) C.K.
