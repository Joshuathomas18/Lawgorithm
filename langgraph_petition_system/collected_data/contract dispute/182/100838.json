Chauhan, J.  \n \n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\"> 1. This writ petition has been filed against the no claim award dated 31.5.1999, passed by the Labour Court, Varanasi, published on 14.10.1999. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\"> 2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to this case are that the petitioner workman raised the industrial dispute, and the appropriate Government in exercise of the powers under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 4K</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (hereinafter called Act, 1947) vide order dated 26th July, 1997 made a reference as to whether the termination of the services of the workman w.e.f. 17.4.1995 was in accordance with law, and if not to what relief he was entitled to? In pursuance of the said reference petitioner workman filed a claim petition contending that respondent No. 2 Jal Sansthan was the principal employer and he was employed as a gun man for security purpose on 3rd April, 1992 through the Director of M/s. Smart Ex Serviceman Security. His work was satisfactory as a Watchman/Guard and he had worked under the direct control and supervision of the respondent No. 2. His salary was paid through the contractor. The agreement between the principal employer and the contractor was sham and thus the respondent No. 2 had been guilty of adopting unfair labour practice. More so, the principle of first come last go had not been adopted, In spite of the fact that he had worked for 240 days in a calendar year counting backward from the date of termination, the order dated 17.4.1995 was liable to be set aside as having been passed in violation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/792073/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 6N</a> of the Act, 1947. Therefore, he should be reinstated with all consequential benefits and regularized with the principal employer in view of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_3\">Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act</a>. 1970 (hereinafter called the Act). The management contested the case submitting that the workman was the employee of the labour contractor non-application No. 3 before the labour court and contract had been signed with the said Firm after inviting quotations from various agencies in addition to the per month salary of Rs. 900. Twenty per cent charges were recovered by the said agent. The agreement was signed on 31.12.1992 and as per the terms of contract the workman was not the direct employee of the said management. In spite of service to non-petitioner No. 3 labour contractor (not impleaded in writ petition) he did not enter appearance. After considering the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence led by the parties before the Labour Court, the Court came to the conclusion that workman was not the employee of the principal employer and he was the employee of the labour contractor. Thus, no claim award was made. Hence, this petition. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\"> 3. Shri S. A. Murtaza, learned counsel for the petitioner, and Shri S. K. Banerji, learned Standing Counsel and Shri M. K. Shukla, learned counsel appearing for the respondents have raised the same issues and made same submissions which had been raised before the labour court. But Mr. Murtaza could not furnish any explanation as to how the labour contractor who was non-applicant No. 3 before the labour court has not been impleaded in this petition. It appears that as the petitioner workman had not sought any relief against the said contract before that labour court and he was not willing to have any relief against him, he has not impleaded the labour contractor before this Court. But once he was a party before the labour court it was proper to implead him here also. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\"> 4. I have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\"> 5. Provisions of the Act do not abolish the contract labour system, it merely authorizes the appropriate Government to abolish the contract labour as is provided under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 10</a> of the said Act. The Scheme of the Act provides that even if the labourer/workmen are employed through the contractor, they should not be exploited or there should be no unfair labour practice in the establishment. The purpose of enactment to the case was to curb the abuses to the employment of contract labour and to regulate their employment and to abolish the same in certain circumstances. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\"> 6. Similarly, Rule 25 of the U. P. Rules, 1975 provides for various checks for supplying the contract labour as it provides for the grant of valid licence and regarding the liability, etc. of the principal employer to the extent that the wages payable to the workmen by the contractor shall not be less than the rates prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_5\">Minimum Wages Act</a>. Moreover, the provisions of the Act, 1970 particularly, <a href=\"/doc/203293/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 14</a> provides for revocation/suspension and amendment of the licence. <a href=\"/doc/1603215/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 16</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1306271/\" id=\"a_8\">21</a> provide for the welfare and health of contract labourer, which includes the liability of the principal employer to provide the facilities of canteen, rest room, first-aid etc. It also provides that the principal employer shall be responsible for the payment of wages to each workman employed by him as contract labour and such wages shall be paid before the prescribed period. <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_9\">Chapter VI of the Act</a> provides for penalty and procedure for contravention of the provisions regarding employment of contract labour. <a href=\"/doc/1574478/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 30</a> of the Act provides that the provisions of the Act shall have an overriding effect over any other law/agreement for the time being in force. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"> 7. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152484\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/152484/\" id=\"a_11\">Gammon India Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, 1974 (1) SCC 596, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court examined the validity of the Act, 1970 and held to be valid observing that the policy of the Act was that working conditions of the contract labour should be so regulated as to ensure payment of wages and provision of essential amenities.</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\"> 8. The objects and reasons of the Act specifically provide that &quot;the working conditions of contract labour should be regulated so as to ensure payment of wages and provisions of essential amenities. Under the Scheme of the Bill, the provisions and maintenance of certain basic welfare amenities for contract labour, like drinking water and first-aid facilities, and in certain cases rest room and canteen, have been made obligatory. Provisions have also been made to guard against delay in the matter of wage payment.&quot; \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"312304\" id=\"span_2\">9. Under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 10</a> of the Act, the appropriate Government has the power to issue a notification for abolition of the contract labour, but there is no other competent authority\n\nunder the Act which can deal with the subject. The labour adjudicator has also not been enclothed with the power to pass any order abolishing the contract labour. If the appropriate Government is satisfied and a notification is issued abolishing contract labour in the establishment, the natural corollary would be that from issuance of such a notification the principal employer shall not be permitted to have labour through a contractor but the question does arise that even if such a notification is issued whether the labourers supplied by the contractor can claim the privilege of absorption on permanent basis with the principal employer. The answer has to be in the negative because the statute does not provide for any such remedial measure. [<a href=\"/doc/312304/\" id=\"a_13\">Vide P. Karunakaran v. Chief Commercial Superintendent and Ors..</a> 1988 Lab IC 1346].</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"> 10. In fact the Act of 1970 has taken away the power of the State Government to refer the industrial dispute relating to employment of contract labour to the Industrial Tribunal.

Even otherwise the Act being a special Act would prevail over the general law i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_15\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> as the Act deals with the subject of contract labour and it had taken away the power of the Government which is enjoyed previously under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 10</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act to refer the dispute relating to contract labour to the Industrial Tribunal. However, under the provisions of the Act, the appropriate Government, if it so desires can prohibit contract labour in any process by issuing required notification, [vide <a href=\"/doc/228472/\" id=\"a_17\">Delhi Cloth and General Mills Company Ltd. and Ors. v.

The Court held as under :</span></span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">  I &quot;Therefore, when the contract system was in vogue, the workmen employed by the contractor were certainly not the workmen of the Corporation.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"> 13. This Court while deciding the Writ Petition No. 14758 of 1990, Indian Explosives Ltd. v. State of U. P. and Ors., vide its judgment dated 25.1.1991 considered the definition of workmen under the Act and compared it with the definition of workmen given under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_22\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and observed as under : \n</p>   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"180120\" id=\"span_6\">&quot;The definition of &#x27;workmen&#x27; as given in C.L.A., therefore, is having a deeming clause also even if such workman is hired in connection with &#x27;such work&#x27; by or through a contractor. Therefore, there is a market distinction in the definition of workmen as given in the C.L.A. and the definition of word &#x27;workmen&#x27; as given in the Act. The award of the Tribunal is based only upon the definition of &#x27;workmen&#x27; as is to be found in the Act with reference to the improvement or changed stand of the Union regarding the relationship of master and servant and that too based upon the statement of witnesses only as regards the nature of work done by them. The said award and the findings of the Tribunal cannot, therefore, be sustained under any circumstances. Strong reliance was placed on behalf of the employers on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/180120/\" id=\"a_23\">Indian General Navigation and Railway Co. Ltd. and Anr. v. Their Workmen</a>, 1966 (I) LLJ 735. In that case the Supreme Court set aside the award of the Industrial Tribunal where the company was directed to pay retrenchment compensation to the workmen. The Supreme Court held that there was no relationship of master and servant between the company and the labour employed by the contractor nor was there any evidence to show that the contract labour became employees of the company at any time. During the course of judgment the Supreme Court held as under :</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">  &#x27;.................... Therefore, we are satisfied that the Tribunal was in error in coming to the conclusion that the retrenched workmen had been employed by Appellant No. 1. That being so, Appellant No. 1 is not the employer of the 56 workmen in question and as such the Tribunal can give them no relief. If they have any claim at all, it would be against the contractor who was their employer.&#x27; \n \n\n On the given facts of the present case, it would be open to the aggrieved persons to get a reference made to the Tribunal for getting reliefs as regards their rights of payment of wages, retrenchment compensation etc. from the contractor.&quot;  \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"> 14. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"777307\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/777307/\" id=\"a_24\">Standard Vacuum Refining Co. of India Ltd. v.

After considering the case the Court held that reference was competent for the reason that the work entrusted to the contractor was incidental to and necessary for the work of the refinery and was of a perennial nature ; it was sufficient to employ a considerable number of whole time workmen and that type of work was being done in most concerns through regular workmen.</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"> 15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1071315\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/1071315/\" id=\"a_25\">R.

When such dispute is raised, it is not a dispute for abolition of the labour contract and hence, <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 10</a> of the Act will not bar either the raising of the adjudication of the dispute. When such dispute is raised, the industrial adjudicator has to decide whether the contract is sham or genuine. It is only if the adjudicator comes to the conclusion that the contract is sham, that he will have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. If, however, he comes to the conclusion that the contract is genuine, he may refer the workmen to the appropriate Government for abolition of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 10</a> of the Act and keep the dispute pending. However, he can do so if the dispute is espoused by the direct workmen of the principal employer. If the workmen of the principal employer have not espoused the dispute, the adjudicator, after coming to the conclusion that the contract is genuine, has to reject the reference, the dispute being not an industrial dispute within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 2(k)</a> of the I. D. Act. He will not be competent to give any relief to the workmen of the erstwhile contractor even if the labour contract is abolished by the appropriate Government under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 10</a> of the Act. \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> (iii) If the labour contract is genuine, a composite industrial dispute can still be raised for abolition of the contract labour and their absorption. However, the dispute, will have to be raised invariably by the direct employees of the principal employer. The industrial adjudicator, after receipt of the reference of such dispute will have first to direct the workmen to approach the appropriate Government for abolition of the contract under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 10</a> of the Act and keep the reference pending. If pursuant to such reference, the contract labour is abolished by the appropriate Government, the industrial adjudicator will have to give opportunity to the parties to place the necessary material before him to decide whether the workmen of the erstwhile contract should be directed to be absorbed by the principal employer how many of them and on what terms. If, however, the contract labour is not abolished, the industrial adjudicator has to reject the reference. \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> (iv) Even after the contract labour system is abolished, the direct employees of the principal employer can raise an industrial dispute for absorption of the Ex-contractor&#x27;s workmen and the adjudicator on the material placed before him can decide as to who and how many of the workmen should be absorbed and on what terms.&quot;  \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"> 17.

Act, no automatic absorption of the contract labour working in the establishment ordered : \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"> (ii) Where the contract was found to be a sham and nominal, rather a camouflage, in which case the contract labour working in the establishment of the principal employer were held, in fact and in reality, the employees of the principal employer himself. Indeed, such cases do not relate to abolition of contract labour but present instances wherein the court pierced the veil and declared the correct position as a fact at the stage after employment of contract labour stood prohibited ; and   \n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\"> (iii) Where in discharge of a statutory obligation of maintaining a canteen in an establishment the principal employer availed the services of a contractor the contract labour would indeed be the employees of the principal employer.  \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1812187\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"549992\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1463407\" id=\"span_14\">The Court further considered the issue whether on a contract engaging contract labour in connection with a work of the principal employer, the relationship of master and servant between him and the contract labour emerges.

If the contract is found to be not genuine but a mere camouflage, the so-called contract labour will have to be treated as employees of the principal employer who shall be directed to regularise the service of the contract labour in the establishment concerned subject to the conditions as may be specified by it for that purpose\n...........................&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"> The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court further cautioned that it is the industrial adjudicator who has to determine the genuineness of the contract and being a question of fact, such an issue cannot be determined in writ jurisdiction.

S. Subramaniam</a>, AIR 1996 SC 1232, the Apex Court held that the only consideration the Court/Tribunal has, in its judicial review, is to consider whether the conclusion is based on the evidence on record and support the finding, or whether the conclusion is based on no evidence.</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"> 22. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1393634\" id=\"span_31\">In General Court <a href=\"/doc/1393634/\" id=\"a_56\">Martial and Ors. v.

Aniltej Singh Dhaliwal, AIR 1998 SC 983, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that the High Court, in its limited power of exercise of judicial review, may interfere by appreciating the evidence only if there is an omission on the part of the authority to consider the relevant evidence.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"317971\" id=\"span_32\">Similarly, in <a href=\"/doc/317971/\" id=\"a_57\">Rajendra Kumar Kindra v. Delhi Administration</a>. (1984) 4 SCC 635, the Court observed as under :</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">  &quot;It is equally well-settled that where a quasi-judicial tribunal or arbitrator records findings based on no legal evidence and the findings are either his ipse dixit or based on conjectures and surmises, the enquiry suffers from the additional infirmity of non-application of mind and stands vitiated .......... Viewed from either angle, the conclusions of the Enquiry Officer ....... are wholly perverse and hence\nunsustainable. The High Court, in\nour opinion was clearly in error in\ndeclining to examine the\ncontention that the findings were\nperverse on the short, specious\nand wholly untenable ground that\nthe matter depends on appraisal\nof evidence. Between appraisal of\nevidence and total lack of\nevidence there is an appreciable\ndifference which could never be\nlost sight of and the High Court\nought not to have short-circuited\nthe writ petition.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\"> 23. In view of the above, as there is a very limited scope of judicial review and there is nothing on record on the basis of which it can be held that the findings of fact recorded by the labour court are perverse being based on no evidence or contrary to the evidence on record, thus there is no occasion for this Court to reappreciate the evidence and interfere with the findings of fact. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\"> 24. Certain issues have halfheartedly been raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner as the contractor was not having the licence, and, therefore, the contract itself was signed in violation of the provisions of Act and should be ignored. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"> 25. No such plea had been taken by the workman before the labour court nor any evidence had been led on this issue. Being a question of fact, it is neither desirable nor permissible for this Court to enter into this issue. It was the petitioner&#x27;s duty to take proper pleadings before the labour court and prove the same in accordance with law. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1462945\" id=\"span_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"187867\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"401288\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1908449\" id=\"span_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1788830\" id=\"span_37\">26.
