Petitioner-company is in the business of owning and\n\nChartering out ships. Respondent is a private company limited by\n\nshares having its registered office at Jaipur and engaged in the\n\nbusiness of exporting, importing various commodities such as\n\nMinerals, Ores and Indonesian Coal. The above-referred to award\n\nis a &quot;foreign award&quot; as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 44</a> of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and published in the United\n\nKingdom, which is a reciprocating territory notified by the Indian\n\nGovernment and is therefore enforceable under the provisions of\n\nChapter-I of Part-II of the Act of 1996. As per averments of the\n\napplication, the foreign award is final and binding under the\n\nEnglish Law pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/1618564/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 47 (1)(c)</a> of the Act of 1996. In\n\nthis regard, one Mrs. Electra Panayotopoulou, an English Solicitor\n\nand Partner of Holman Fenwick Willan LLP of Friary Court, 65\n\nCrutched Friars, London EC3N 2AE United Kingdom, practicing in\n\nthe aforementioned firm&#x27;s Piraeus office located at 83 Akti Miaouli\n\n&amp; Flessa Street, 185 38 Piraeus, Greece, which is the Solicitor on\n\nrecord of the Award Holder in the arbitration proceedings, has\n\naffirmed an affidavit on 29th August, 2016 authenticating the\n\nForeign Award in accordance with English law as required by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/134675436/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 47 (1)(a)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and\n\nhas confirmed that the Foreign Award has become final and\n\nbinding under English law. Foreign award has been passed in\n                                    (3 of 31)\n                                                              [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nfavour of the petitioner pursuant to the Charterparty and the\n\narbitration clause contained therein as evidenced by way of the\n\nfixture recap dated 24.12.2015 (&quot;the Charterparty&quot;) between the\n\nrespondent as the charterer and the petitioner as the owner of the\n\nvessel MV Vantage Key (&quot;the Vassel&quot;) chartered to the respondent.\n\nIn this regard, one Konstantinos Savvidis, General Manager of\n\nVantage Shipping Lines SA, the appointed Commercial Managers\n\nof the Vessel on behalf of the petitioner company, has sworn an\n\naffidavit dated 29.08.2016, enclosing a copy of the Charterparty\n\nas evidenced by way of the fixture recap dated 24.12.2015, in\n\nwhich he has certified that the arbitration agreement concluded in\n\nthe Charterparty by way of the arbitration clause is in writing and\n\nwas made by exchange of communications in writing, so far as\n\nrelevant,       through   email,       telex   or   other     means       of\n\ntelecommunications, as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/503141/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 47 (1) (b)</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Pursuant to the\n\nCharterparty, the respondent agreed to take on charter and the\n\nOwners agreed to charter, the vessel to carry a cargo of 12,500\n\nmts bagged rice from Krishnapatnam, East Coast, India to\n\nLattakia, Syria (&#x27;the Cargo&quot;). The fixture note dated 24.12.2015\n\nmakes specific reference to the Charterparty, which in its Clause\n\n20 states as under:\n\n               &quot;20) ENGLISH LAW/ARB LONDON/LMAA\n               RULES TO APPLY&quot;.\n\n\n\n      As per the contents of the application, the petitioner on\n\n28.12.2015 informed the respondent of the vessel&#x27;s expected\n\narrival   at    the   landport    of   Krishnapatnam    and    requested\n                                (4 of 31)\n                                                          [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nconfirmation that the cargo would be ready for loading. The\n\nrespondent informed the petitioner of delay of 2-3 days due to\n\nalleged documentation issues of the Shipper, but confirmed that\n\nrespondent would pay any applicable demurrage for delay as per\n\nthe   Charterparty.   Subsequently         between   02.01.2016     and\n\n11.01.2016, the respondent kept assuring, but failed to provide\n\nany cargo for loading as per the Charterparty. In fact, on\n\n07.01.2016, the respondent requested that the Charterparty be\n\ncalled and refixed for cargo at a later date to which the petitioner\n\nagreed only on the respondent&#x27;s confirmation to reimburse the\n\npetitioner for damages suffered. Subsequently, on respondent&#x27;s\n\nfailure to provide cargo even by 12.01.2016, the petitioner was\n\nconstrained to accept the respondent&#x27;s conduct, (including the\n\nattempt on 07.01.2016 to cancel the Charterparty), as evidence of\n\nthe respondent&#x27;s renunciation and termination of the Charterparty\n\nand sailed the vessel out. Subsequent to termination, the\n\npetitioner attempted to find alternative employment for the\n\nvessel, but no fixture could be concluded due to the collapse of\n\nthe dry bulk market. Therefore, the petitioner was constrained to\n\nlay up the vessel in Malaysia on 22.01.2016 to mitigate the losses\n\ndue to the respondent&#x27;s breach and the prevailing market\n\nconditions. The respondent&#x27;s failure to provide cargo for the vessel\n\namounted to a repudiatory breach of contract entitling the\n\npetitioner to terminate the Charterparty and recover damages\n\nsuffered as a result of the breach. The petitioner calculated its\n\ndamages on the basis of the freight and demurrage and what it\n\nwould have earned, had the cargo been shipped, less the costs\n                                (5 of 31)\n                                                        [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nthat would have been incurred, had the voyage being performed.\n\nThe damages calculated were amounted to a sum of US$\n\n172,255.17, for which the petitioner issued a final freight invoice\n\non 15.01.2016. Petitioner on 13.01.2016 received a payment of\n\nonly US$ 18000/- from the shippers/cargo interests, which the\n\npetitioner has offset with its claim against the respondent to\n\nreduce the total sum claimed in the arbitral proceedings to US$\n\n154,255.17.\n\n     Further case of the petitioner is that disputes and differences\n\nhaving arisen between the petitioner and respondent under the\n\nCharterparty, the petitioner instructed Messer&#x27;s Holman Fenwick\n\nWillan LLP as their English Solicitors in the London arbitration to\n\ncommence arbitration proceedings against the respondent by\n\nappointing Mr. David Aikman residing at 64, Aligton Drive,\n\nTonbridge, Kent, TN104HH United Kingdom, on 08.02.2016 as\n\ntheir arbitrator. The letter of request for appointment dated\n\n08.02.2016 sent to Mr. David Aikman by HFM along with Mr. David\n\nAikman&#x27;s letter of acceptance dated 08.02.2016 has been placed\n\non record. Petitioner sent an arbitration notice on 08.02.2016 to\n\nthe respondent invoking the arbitration clause and requesting\n\nthem to appoint their Arbitrator as per the terms of the\n\nCharterparty. Petitioner through their lawyers further sent a notice\n\nto the respondent on 23.02.2016 both via brokering channels and\n\nto the personal email addresses of the respondent&#x27;s principals\n\naffording the respondent a further time of 7 days to appoint their\n\narbitrator or agree to the appointment of the sole arbitrator as per\n\nSection 17(2) of the English Arbitration Act, 1996. Since the\n                                (6 of 31)\n                                                          [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nrespondent failed to appoint an arbitrator on their behalf as per\n\nthe English Arbitration Act, 1996, the Arbitrator appointed by the\n\npetitioner Mr.David Aikman could be appointed as Sole Arbitrator\n\nin the matter. The notice of appointment of Mr. Aikman as Sole\n\nArbitrator was served by the petitioner on the respondent through\n\ntheir lawyers on 04.03.2016 both via brokering channels and to\n\nthe email addresses of the respondent principals. Petitioner\n\nsubmitted their claim submissions to the Sole Arbitrator and\n\nserved a copy of the same on Indo Ferro on 11.03.2016 both via\n\nthe brokers and email IDs of respondent&#x27;s principals. The\n\npetitioner also requested the respondent to notify them if they\n\nrequired hard copies of the submissions sent to their officers. The\n\npetitioner also requested the respondent to submit their defence\n\nsubmissions within the customary 28 days. But the respondent\n\nfailed to serve their defence submissions even by 11.04.2016. The\n\npetitioner then vide an email dated 12.04.2016 requested the\n\narbitrator to direct extension of time for service of defence\n\nsubmissions. The arbitrator by an order dated 13.04.2016 directed\n\nthe respondent to submit their submission by 27.04.2016.\n\nHowever in view of respondent&#x27;s failure to file defence submissions\n\neven by 27.04.2016, the Sole Arbitrator issued a final and\n\nperemptory   order   for   service     of   defence   submissions    by\n\n06.05.2016, vide an email dated 28.04.2016. In the said email,\n\nthe arbitrator notified the respondent that if they fail to comply\n\nwith this order and serve their defence submissions in time, the\n\nSole Arbitrator would be constrained to proceed on the basis of\n\nthe submission filed by the petitioner. Petitioner vide an email\n                                (7 of 31)\n                                                         [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\ndated 17.05.2016 requested the arbitrator to proceed with the\n\naward as the respondent failed to serve their defence submissions\n\nby the final deadline of 06.05.2016. The arbitrator confirmed that\n\nhe would proceed with the award vide an email on the same day.\n\nIt was thereafter that the Sole Arbitrator after due consideration\n\nof the documents and evidence before it and after hearing the\n\nsubmissions and arguments on behalf of the petitioner, passed its\n\nfinal reasoned award on the merits of the case on 18.05.2016 and\n\nheld as follows,\n\n                 &quot;a. That the petitioner&#x27;s claim for\n           damages and/or compensation succeeds in\n           the amount of US$ 154,255.17/-.\n                 b. That the respondent will pay to the\n           petitioner the sum of US$ 154,255.17/- along\n           with interest thereon at 4% per annum,\n           compounded quarterly from 18.01.2016 till\n           the date of payment.\n                 c. That the respondent shall pay the\n           petitioner costs in relation to this arbitration\n           award, together with interest thereon at the\n           rate of 4% per annum compounded quarterly\n           from the date of the foreign award of the date\n           of payment.\n                 d. That the respondent shall bear and\n           pay the costs of the arbitration award in the\n           sum of GBP 2,080 which is to be reimbursed\n           to the petitioner with interest thereon at the\n           rate of 4% per annum compounded quarterly\n           from the date of the foreign award to the date\n           of payment.&quot;\n\n\n     The award in original and its copy has been placed on record.\n\nA copy of the arbitral award was duly served on the respondent by\n\nthe arbitrator vide an email of 19.05.2016 and the respondent&#x27;s\n\ncopy of the original foreign award was also served by courier at its\n\nregistered address i.e. 311, Brij Anukampa, K-13, Ashok Marg, C-\n\nScheme, Jaipur 302001 on 19.05.2016.\n                               (8 of 31)\n                                                      [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\n     Shri Amitava Majumdar, learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioner, argued that the arbitrator in the foreign award has\n\nadjudged the respondent liable to pay a sum of US$ 154,255.17/-\n\ntowards the petitioner&#x27;s claim of outstanding freight earnable,\n\ndemurrage and damages under the Charterparty, together with\n\ninterest at the rate of 4% per annum compounded quarterly, from\n\n18.01.2016 till the date of payment and sums recoverable as\n\ncosts. After the foreign award was issued, the petitioner through\n\nits English Solicitor, M/s. Holman Fenwick Willan, made a demand\n\nupon the respondent, requesting them to honour the foreign\n\naward on 19.05.2016 and make payment of US$ 156,337,34 plus\n\nGBP 2,080 towards arbitration costs. In this regard, copy of the\n\nemail sent to the respondent and the enclosed demand notice is\n\nplaced on record. Petitioner stated that even though the foreign\n\naward is final and binding, the arbitrator has not yet made a\n\ndetermination on the recoverable legal costs incurred by the\n\npetitioner, but has reserved its powers and jurisdiction for the\n\nsame.\n\n     Learned counsel submitted that the Charterparty expressly\n\nstipulates that disputes would be resolved by arbitration and\n\nEnglish law would apply. The arbitration agreement is valid under\n\nEnglish law, which is the law to which the parties have subjected\n\nthemselves   to. The claim for damages       for breach of the\n\nCharterparty as sought by the petitioner in the London arbitration\n\nproceedings is capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws\n\nof India.    The respondent was at all times served with all\n\nnecessary documents in the London arbitration proceedings. The\n                                 (9 of 31)\n                                                               [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nrespondent out of its own volition had taken a conscientious\n\ndecision of not taking part in the London arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe Sole Arbitrator has arrived at a finding on fact and law in\n\npublishing the said foreign award. The said foreign award does not\n\ndeal with a dispute not contemplated by, or not falling within the\n\nterms   of   the   submission   to    arbitration   of   the    arbitration\n\nagreement. There is no allegation of any irregularity in the\n\ncomposition of the arbitral tribunal and the arbitral procedure. The\n\nsaid foreign award is binding on the respondent and has not been\n\nset aside or suspended by the English High Court, which is the\n\ncompetent authority of the country where the said foreign award\n\nwas made. The time limit for leave to appeal under English law is\n\n28 days which has since expired and no appeal has been filed.\n\n     Learned counsel argued that the enforcement and execution\n\nof the said foreign award is not contrary to the public policy of\n\nIndia. The terms of the Charterparty with reference to the\n\ndemurrage rate, cargo to be carried, charges and landport and\n\ndischarge port have not been disputed and the parties to the\n\ncontract of carriage have also not been disputed. Moreover,\n\ncalculation of the initial payment of the damages has also not\n\nbeen disputed.\n\n     Shri Susshil Daga, learned counsel for the respondent has\n\ncontended that the petitioner has miserably failed to establish an\n\nagreement between the petitioner and the respondent. Bare\n\nperusal of the alleged agreement show that there is no clarity on\n\nthe law to be applied in case of dispute between the parties. In\n\nthe instant case, it is clear that the parties have not entered into\n                                (10 of 31)\n                                                         [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nany formal written agreement, therefore, the pre-requisites to\n\ninitiate any arbitral proceedings are not proved, argued the\n\nlearned counsel. Alternatively, learned counsel argued that even if\n\nit is presumed that the agreement dated 24.12.2015 has been\n\nexecuted by the parties, then also the dispute resolution clause\n\nitself shows that there was no clarity in relation to arbitration\n\nproceeding to be initiated by the parties as a bare perusal of\n\nclause 19 of the alleged agreement states conditions as to when\n\nLondon Law of Arbitration would apply and when US Law of\n\nArbitration will apply. The condition forming base of application of\n\nLondon Law of Arbitration or US Law of Arbitration was required to\n\nbe stated in Box 25 of the alleged agreement, but that Box was\n\nleft empty. Hence when the law relating to arbitration itself is not\n\nclear, neither the agreement can be taken to have been executed\n\nvalidly, nor the award arising out of such agreement can be\n\nenforced. The award passed pursuant to the said agreement would\n\nthus be a nullity because the Arbitrator has failed to fathom that\n\nthe parties have not come to terms in relation to the Arbitrator\n\nclause. Hence in absence of proper agreement between the\n\nparties, the very initiation of proceedings by the Arbitrator was not\n\ncompetent.\n\n     It is contended that perusal of the award would show that it\n\nhas been passed contrary to the public interest as losses beyond\n\nthe alleged agreement has also been awarded against the\n\nrespondent. This act of the Arbitrator reflects that the award has\n\nbeen passed with ill intention and hence execution of an award\n\narising out of an unexecuted agreement and an incomplete\n                                 (11 of 31)\n                                                           [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\ndispute resolution clause cannot be allowed. Present application is\n\ntherefore liable to be dismissed.\n\n     Shri Susshil Daga, learned counsel for the respondent\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_1\">submitted that the Cargo to be shipped by the petitioner was\n\ndelayed because of force majeure reasons like the Port Authorities\n\nwere regularly questioning the respondent as to why the goods\n\nhad to be shipped to Syria which was disturbed because of on\n\ngoing major international dispute in that country. The Arbitrator\n\nwhile passing his award has not considered this aspect at all. The\n\naward of the Arbitrator is thus against the Public Policy and cannot\n\nbe sustained in law. The Arbitrator failed to consider the genuine\n\nreasons of delay of Cargo. The original consignee of goods delayed\n\nthe entire transaction and hence passing an award against the\n\nrespondent for no fault of his, clearly shows that the Arbitrator did\n\nnot attempt to go to the root cause of the loss. It is contended\n\nthat M/s. Guru Group India, the company responsible for sending\n\nthe goods to be shipped on the vessel, had in their letter dated\n\n7.1.2016 to the petitioner undertaken a guarantee to pay for any\n\nclaims, which arises out of cancellation of contract and the\n\npetitioner is fully aware of this fact. Even if therefore it is assumed\n\nthat the petitioner has suffered losses, the same has to be\n\nrecovered from M/s. Guru Group India. Even then, the petitioner\n\nhas not impleaded M/s. Guru Group India as party-respondent to\n\nthe present proceedings. Therefore, the present application is\n\nliable to be dismissed as it suffers from non-joinder of necessary\n\nparties. Learned counsel further argued that it was agreed\n\nbetween the parties that the respondent shall compensate the\n                                (12 of 31)\n                                                            [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\npetitioner for the loss attributable to it by way of payment of US$\n\n18,000, which the respondent has already paid. No further\n\ncompensation    was    therefore    payable.   Initiation   of   arbitral\n\nproceedings and consequential award being contrary to law, are\n\nliable to be ignored. Moreover, the loss against which the\n\npetitioner is demanding execution of this award is already insured\n\nand hence further award of compensation to the petitioner would\n\namount to unjust enrichment of the petitioner. The present\n\napplication is therefore liable to be dismissed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">     Shri Amitava Majumdar, learned counsel for the petitioner,\n\nhas submitted in rejoinder that contracts of carriage could be\n\nconcluded even by way of email communications and a fixture\n\nrecap, as in the present case. It is therefore that the parties\n\nentered into Charterparty dated 24.12.2015 by way of a fixture\n\nrecap. This practice has been recognised by the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of Shakti Bhog Food Ltd. vs. Kola Shipping Ltd.-(2009)2 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">134. The respondent has wrongly disputed Clause 20 in the\n\nFixture recap relating to the arbitration clause with regard to the\n\ncontract of carriage being a valid agreement. Without prejudice to\n\nthe fact that a Charterparty by way of fixture recap does not need\n\nto be signed, it is contended that in the instant case, the fixture\n\nrecap was also signed by each party and exchanged by e-mail,\n\ncopies whereof have been placed on record. An affidavit dated\n\n29.8.2016 of Mr. Konstantinos Savvidis, the General Manager of\n\nowners of the vessel, would substantiate the conclusion of the said\n\nCharterparty by way of email exchanges and fixture recap.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">     Learned counsel further argued that contention of the\n                                    (13 of 31)\n                                                           [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nrespondent that there is ambiguity as to the choice of law,\n\nwhether US law or English law, would apply is absolutely without\n\nany foundation. The law applicable to the Charterparty is clearly\n\nstated in clause 20 of the Fixture recap signed by both parties.\n\nClause 20 expresses the choice of the place and law to be applied\n\nfor the adjudication of disputes in arbitration to be &quot;ENGLISH\n\nLAW/ARB LONDON/LMAA RULES TO APPLY.&quot; It is further submitted\n\nthat even otherwise, Box 25 of a proforma Gencon Form states\n\nthat when the Box is left empty, the default Clause to be read is\n\nClause 19(a) of Part II of the Gencon Charterparty, which provides\n\nfor &quot;English Law&quot; and &quot;London Arbitration.&quot; Even in case of a\n\nconflict between the Fixture recap / note and the proforma\n\nCharterparty, the Court is to try and interpret the two clauses by\n\nway of harmonious construction.

This cannot be a ground of rejection of\n\nthe enforcement under <a href=\"/doc/444899/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 48</a> of the Arbitration Act. Relying\n\non the judgement of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/15591279/\" id=\"a_6\">Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. vs.\n\nProgetto Grano Spa-</a>(2014) 2 SCC 433, learned counsel argued\n\nthat the grounds for refusing the enforcement of the award under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/444899/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 48</a> of the Arbitration Act are limited to award being\n\ncontrary to (1) fundamental policy of Indian law, (2) the interest\n\nof India and (3) justice or morality.

At no time during the exchange of correspondence\n\nbetween the petitioner and respondent, did the respondent\n\ncontend or declare force majeure conditions as the basis for delay\n\nin shipping of the cargo. The respondent itself vide an email dated\n\n7.1.2016 stated that the supplier-M/s.Guru Group India has failed\n\nto &quot;bring the cargo load ready&quot; and, therefore, they were left with\n\nno other option but to cancel the fixture.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">      It    is   contended    that     Charterparty     provided     that    the\n\nrespondent as charterers of the vessel had the option of\n\nnominating an alternative port. Such failure or inability to provide\n\nthe cargo does not imply force majeure conditions and delays and\n\ncosts arising out of such failure are to the respondent&#x27;s account. It\n\nwas duty of the respondent to procure cargo for the purpose of\n\ncarrying out its obligations under the Charterparty. Learned\n\ncounsel in support of his arguments has relied on the english\n\njudgement of the Court of Appeal in Triton Navigation Ltd. vs. Viol\n\nS.A.

As\n\nper the letter of the respondent dated 12.01.2016, the payment of\n\nUS $ 18000 (US $ 17,96.67) was made only as `initial payment\n\nliability&#x27;. This was calculated on the basis of US $ 5,000 being the\n\nagreed demurrage rate into the time period calculated from the\n\ndate of cancelling the CP (7.1.2016) till the first day of the next\n\nweek (11.1.2016). This was anticipated to be the earliest date by\n\nwhich the petitioner could try and arrange for an alternate fixture.\n\nThe remaining losses would be determined on the basis of the\n\npetitioner being able to find an alternate fixture.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">     Learned counsel contended that the respondent cannot at\n\nthe stage of enforcement of the award revisit the merits of the\n\ncase. Further contention of the respondent that the loss claimed\n\nagainst the respondent is insured and award of compensation on\n\nthat account would be unjust enrichment, is totally false. There\n\nhas been no insurance recovery in respect of the losses awarded\n\nin the award. The stand of the respondent that the awarded\n\namount is to be recovered from M/s. Guru Group India, the\n\nsupplier of the respondent, which failed to arrange the cargo, and\n\nnot from the respondent and on that basis further contention that\n\nthere was non-joinder of necessary parties, is liable to be rejected\n\nbeing wholly untenable. The petitioner is not a party to any\n\nalleged guarantee or any alleged contract between M/s. Guru\n\nGroup India and the respondent. The petitioner has no nexus or\n\nprivity of contract with M/s. Guru Group India and is therefore in\n                               (16 of 31)\n                                                                [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nno way connected and concerned with them. The award arising\n\nout of a Charterparty between only the petitioner and the\n\nrespondent, there is no scope of initiating any proceedings against\n\na third party, who is neither a party to the Charterparty or a\n\ndebtor under the award for sums due from the respondent under\n\nthe Charterparty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">     I   have   given   my   anxious       consideration   to     the    rival\n\nsubmissions and perused the material on record and studied the\n\ncited case laws.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">     Contention of the respondent that there was no written /\n\nsigned agreement or that the petitioner has failed to establish any\n\nwritten or signed agreement between the parties, is liable to be\n\nrejected in view of the Charterparty dated 24.12.2015 entered\n\ninto between the petitioner and the respondent by way of fixture\n\nrecap. It is a common and accepted practice in the shipping\n\nindustry to conclude contracts of carriage by way of email\n\ncommunications and a fixture recap. The email from the brokers\n\nattaching the countersigned Charterparty, along with enclosed\n\ncountersigned fixture recap, has been produced on record of this\n\napplication as Annexure-A, which clearly show the affixation of\n\nseal of the petitioner as well as of the respondent and also the\n\nsignatures of their representatives. The affidavit of Konstantinos\n\nSavvidis, the General Manager of Owners of the vessel produced\n\nat Annexure-3 to the application gave complete details of more\n\nthan a dozen emails exchanged between the petitioner and\n\nrespondent and many of them, through broker, giving offers and\n\ncounter offers, in which the agreed fixture recap of the main terms\n                               (17 of 31)\n                                                        [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nof the Charterparty which included arbitration clause, as agreed\n\nbetween the parties, being English Law Arbitration in London as\n\nper LMAA Rules, throughout remained unamended, though there\n\nwere variations in laycan period and rate of freight. Copies of all\n\nsuch e-mails have been enclosed with the said affidavit. It would\n\nbe seen therefrom that the petitioner sent email dated 28.12.2015\n\nat 09:28 hours and circulated a copy of the clean Fixture recap\n\nduly signed and stamped by the petitioner and requested the\n\nCharterers (through brokers) to countersign and stamp the same.\n\nThe respondent vide email dated 28th December at 12.31 hours\n\nreturned the duly countersigned and stamped Fixture recap, which\n\nrepresents the signed Charterparty as and between the parties.\n\nContention of the learned counsel for the respondent that there is\n\nambiguity as to the choice of law in that whether US law or\n\nEnglish law, would be applicable is therefore noted to be rejected\n\nfor the stated reasons. The law applicable to the Charterparty has\n\nbeen clearly stated in Clause 20 of the Fixture recap, which has\n\nbeen jointly signed by both the parties. Clause 20 expresses the\n\nchoice of the place and the law to be applied for adjudication of\n\ndisputes in arbitration to be &quot;ENGLISH LAW/ARB LONDON/LMAA\n\nRULES TO APPLY&quot;. Besides, the Box 25 of the proforma Gencon\n\nForm, which in this case was left empty states that when the Box\n\nis left empty, the default Clause to be read is Clause 19(a) of Part\n\nII of the Gencon Charterparty which provides for &quot;English Law&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">and &quot;London Arbitration.&quot; The arbitration procedure adopted by\n\nthe Tribunal in passing the award, as agreed to in the fixture\n\nrecap, was thus English Law in London.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                (18 of 31)\n                                                             [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\n     The facts of the case before the Supreme Court in Shakti\n\nBhog, supra are somewhat identical to the present case. In that\n\ncase too, the appellant addressed an email to the respondent\n\nwhereby it promised to load 13,500 MT of the cargo at Kakinada\n\nPort for transportation to Cotonou. The respondent therein, issued\n\na bill of lading. As per the terms and conditions of the Charter\n\nParty Agreement, the appellant had to load the said cargo within\n\nnine days on or before 6th of August, 2005.

On 19th of\n\nAugust,   2005,   the   appellant    addressed     an    e-mail   to   the\n\nrespondent stating that he was              ready to    compensate the\n\nrespondent for the loss suffered by it. On 24th of August, 2005,\n\nthe respondent addressed an email back to the appellant stating\n\nthat it was not satisfied with the demurrage amount offered to be\n\npaid by the appellant. The appellant therein loaded 1100 MT of the\n\ncargo in the vessel from 6th of August, 2005 to 9th of August,\n\n2005 as against 13,500 MT of the agreed cargo. On 5th of\n\nSeptember, 2005, the appellant sent an email to the respondent\n                               (19 of 31)\n                                                       [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nrequesting it to unload the cargo from the vessel. But the cargo\n\nwas not unloaded from the vessel due to the ongoing disputes\n\nbetween the parties. After various proceedings, the respondent\n\nmoved an application under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 45</a> of the Act of 1996 to refer\n\nthe dispute between the parties to arbitration in London under the\n\nprovisions of the English Arbitration Act, 1996 and for staying all\n\nfurther proceedings in the suit pending arbitration. The Additional\n\nDistrict Judge, Kakinada, allowed the application by order dated\n\n30th of November, 2006. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant filed a\n\nCivil Revision Petition before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh at\n\nHyderabad which was dismissed on a finding that there was a\n\nCharter Party Agreement in existence and the appellant could not\n\ndeny the existence of the same. It was against this order that an\n\nappeal was filed before the Supreme Court. The case of the\n\nappellant before the Supreme Court was that the appellant agreed\n\nto load and respondent agreed to carry 13,500 MT of the cargo\n\nfrom Kakinada Port to Cotonou pursuant to a Charterparty\n\nagreement, which provided for arbitration in Box 25 and clause 19\n\nand thus dispute pertaining to the same were to be referred to\n\narbitration in London under the <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_10\">English Arbitration Act</a>. In that\n\ncase too, the front page of the Charterparty contained signature of\n\nthe appellant. The Supreme Court refused to accept the argument\n\nthat such a signature would not amount to a valid arbitration\n\nagreement. The Supreme Court referring to <a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 7</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act held that arbitration agreement can be inferred\n\nfrom a document signed by the parties, or an exchange of letters,\n\ntelex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which\n                               (20 of 31)\n                                                        [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nprovide a record of the agreement. The Supreme Court repelled\n\nthe contention of the appellant that under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 7</a> of the Act, the\n\nletter/faxes or mails or any other communications, in the absence\n\nof any agreement, will have to contain the arbitration clause. The\n\nexpressions of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 7</a> do not specify any requirement to this\n\neffect, held the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in para 17 of\n\nthe judgement has held as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           &quot;17. The appellant contended that the respondent\n           did not file the original charter party agreement in\n           any of the proceedings before any of the lower\n           courts. We would want to reiterate that as far as\n           the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 7</a> of the Act is concerned,\n           an arbitration agreement may be in the form of\n           an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form\n           of a separate agreement and furthermore an\n           arbitration is considered to be in writing if it is\n           contained in a document signed by the parties or\n           in an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or\n           other means of telecommunication which provide\n           a record of the agreement or an exchange of\n           statement of claim and defence in which the\n           existence of an agreement is alleged by one party\n           and not denied by the other. So from the\n           provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 7</a>, it is clear that a charter\n           party agreement need not be in writing signed by\n           both parties and this could as well be made out\n           from the acts of the parties to the agreement by\n           way of their exchange of letters and information\n           through fax, e-mails etc.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1954535\" id=\"span_2\">The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1954535/\" id=\"a_16\">Groupe Chimique Tunisien SA vs.\n\nSouthern    Petrochemicals      Industries     Corporation        Ltd.-</a>\n\n(2006) 5 SCC 275 held that under <a href=\"/doc/153260/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 if there is reference in a contract to a\n\ndocument containing arbitration clause, such reference constitutes\n\nan arbitration agreement, if the contract was in writing and the\n\nreference was such as to make that arbitration clause a part of the\n\ncontract.

Accordingly, for the purposes\n          of <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 34</a>, this Court added a new category -\n          patent illegality - for setting aside the award.\n          While adding this category for setting aside the\n          award on the ground of patent illegality, the\n          Court clarified that illegality must go to the root\n          of the matter and if the illegality is of trivial\n          nature it cannot be held that award is against\n          public policy. Award could also be set aside if it\n          was so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the\n          conscience of the court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">          26. From the discussion made by this Court in\n          Saw Pipes in paragraph 18, para 22 and para 31\n          of the Report, it can be safely observed that\n          while accepting the narrow meaning given to the\n          expression &quot;public policy&quot; in Renusagar in the\n          matters of enforcement of foreign award, there\n          was departure from the said meaning for the\n          purposes of the jurisdiction of the Court in\n          setting aside the award under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 34</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">          27. In our view, what has been stated by this\n          Court in Renusagar with reference to Section\n          7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must\n                     (23 of 31)\n                                                [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nequally apply to the ambit and scope of <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n48(2)(b)</a> of the 1996 Act. In Renusagar, it has\nbeen expressly exposited that the expression\n&quot;public policy&quot; in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the\nForeign Awards Act refers to the public policy of\nIndia. The expression &quot;public policy&quot; used\nin <a href=\"/doc/961785/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 7(1)(b)(ii)</a> was held to mean &quot;public\npolicy of India&quot;. A distinction in the rule of public\npolicy between a matter governed by the\ndomestic law and a matter involving conflict of\nlaws has been noticed in Renusagar. For all this\nthere is no reason why Renusagar should not\napply as regards the scope of inquiry\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 48(2)(b)</a>. Following Renusagar, we\nthink that for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 48(2)(b)</a>,\nthe expression &quot;public policy of India&quot; must be\ngiven narrow meaning and the enforcement of\nforeign award would be refused on the ground\nthat it is contrary to public policy of India if it is\ncovered by one of the three categories\nenumerated in Renusagar. Although the same\nexpression &quot;public policy of India&quot; is used both\nin <a href=\"/doc/549389/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 34(2)(b)(ii)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 48(2)(b)</a> and\nthe concept of &quot;public policy in India&quot; is same in\nnature in both the Sections but, in our view, its\napplication differs in degree insofar as these two\nSections are concerned. The application of &quot;public\npolicy of India&quot; doctrine for the purposes\nof <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 48(2)(b)</a> is more limited than the\napplication of the same expression in respect of\nthe domestic arbitral award.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">28.

Nariman that the\nexpression &quot;public policy of India&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_44\">Section\n48(2)(b)</a> is an expression of wider import than\nthe &quot;public policy&quot; in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the\nForeign Awards Act. We have no hesitation in\nholding that Renusagar must apply for the\npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/1234356/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 48(2)(b)</a> of the 1996 Act.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86594\" id=\"span_8\">Insofar as the proceeding for setting aside an\naward under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 34</a> is concerned, the\nprinciples <a href=\"/doc/86594/\" id=\"a_47\">laid down in</a> Saw Pipes would govern\nthe scope of such proceedings.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">29.

The\n\nArbitration was held in London according to English Law. The\n\nrespondent Ashapura Minechem Limited was held liable and was\n\ndirected to pay a sum of US$ 36,306,104/- together with\n\ncompound interest at the rate of 3.75% per annum. It was further\n\ndirected to pay US$ 74,135 together with compound interest at\n\nthe rate of 3.75% per annum and another sum of 90,233.66\n\nPounds together with compound interest at the rate of 2.5% per\n\nannum. Before the arbitration had commenced, respondent\n\nAshapura Minechem Limited filed a suit along with an application\n\nfor injunction before the Civil Judge at Jam-khambalia, Gujarat,\n\npraying for declaration of the Arbitration Clause contained therein\n\nas illegal, null and void ab-initio. The civil suit was dismissed for\n\nwant of jurisdiction and appeal filed by respondent Ashapura\n\nbefore the Gujarat High Court was dismissed as withdrawn. The\n\nrespondent Ashapura Minechem Limited thereafter resorted to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in respect\n\nto the award passed in London before the District Judge,\n\nJamnagar, together with an injunction application.

The Courts in various\n\njurisdictions held the Award to be enforceable in the same manner\n\nas a judgment of the Court. The District Judge, Jamnagar\n\ndismissed the injunction application whereagainst a writ of\n\ncertiorari under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_60\">Articles 226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_61\">227</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nwas filed by the respondent Ashapura Minechem Limited before\n                                     (27 of 31)\n                                                                    [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nthe Gujarat High Court at Ahmedabad to quash and set aside the\n\norder passed by the District Judge and for a direction not to\n\nenforce the execution of the award on the plea that their\n\nobjections under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 were pending. The Single Bench of the High Court set aside\n\nthe   order   of   the   District    Judge,      dismissing   the     injunction\n\napplication and remanded the matter for decision in accordance\n\nwith the law. In Letters Patent Appeal filed by respondent Eitzen\n\nBulk A/S, the Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat directed\n\nthe District Judge to consider all contentions. The appellant Eitzen\n\nBulk A/S thereupon filed writ petition before the High Court\n\nquestioning the very jurisdiction of a Court in India to decide\n\nobjections under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 34</a> of Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 in respect of a Foreign Award. The Single Bench of the High\n\nCourt issued notice and stayed further proceedings before the\n\nJamnagar Court. The respondent Ashapura Minechem Limited\n\nhowever filed Letters Patent Appeal challenging the Order of the\n\nSingle Judge. The Division Bench of the High Court reversed the\n\njudgment of the Single Bench and held that the respondent\n\nAshapura Minechem Limited was entitled to challenge the Foreign\n\nAward under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 34</a> of Part I of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 and further held that the territorial\n\njurisdiction is a mixed question of fact and law and is required to\n\nbe decided by the Trial Court in accordance with the Plaint and\n\nWritten Statement and Evidence before it. It was this judgment\n\nwhich was challenged by the appellant Eitzen Bulk A/S before the\n\nSupreme Court. In those facts, the Supreme Court, while\n                               (28 of 31)\n                                                          [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\ninterpreting Clause 28 of the contract for charterers for shipment,\n\nheld in Para 26 and 27 of the report as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">          &quot;26. According to the learned counsel, Clause\n          28, which is the Arbitration Clause in the\n          Contract, clearly stipulates that any dispute\n          under the Contract &quot;is to be settled and referred\n          to Arbitration in London&quot;. It further stipulates\n          that English Law to apply. The parties have thus\n          clearly intended that the Arbitration will be\n          conducted in accordance with English Law and\n          the seat of the Arbitration will be at London.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">          27. The question is whether the above\n          stipulations show the intention of the parties to\n          expressly or impliedly exclude the provisions of\n          Part I to the Arbitration, which was to be held\n          outside India, i.e., in London. We think that the\n          clause evinces such an intention by providing\n          that the English Law will apply to the Arbitration.\n          The clause expressly provides that Indian Law or\n          any other law will not apply by positing that\n          English Law will apply. The intention is that\n          English Law will apply to the resolution of any\n          dispute arising under the law. This means that\n          English Law will apply to the conduct of the\n          Arbitration. It must also follow that any\n          objection to the conduct of the Arbitration or the\n          Award will also be governed by English Law.\n          Clearly, this implies that the challenge to the\n          Award must be in accordance with English Law.\n          There is thus an express exclusion of the\n          applicability of Part I to the instant Arbitration by\n          Clause 28. In fact, Clause 28 deals with not only\n          the seat of Arbitration but also provides that\n          there shall be two Arbitrators, one appointed by\n          the charterers and one by the owners and they\n          shall appoint an Umpire, in case there is no\n          agreement. In this context, it may be noted that\n          the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_65\">Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>\n          makes no provision for Umpires and the\n          intention is clearly to refer to an Umpire\n          contemplated by Section 21 of the English\n          Arbitration Act, 1996. It is thus clear that the\n          intention is that the Arbitration should be\n          conducted under the English law, i.e. the English\n          Arbitration Act, 1996. It may also be noted that\n          <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_66\">Sections 67</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_67\">68</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_68\">69</a> of the English Arbitration\n          Act provide for challenge to an Award on\n          grounds stated therein. The intention is thus\n          clearly to exclude the applicability of Part I to\n          the instant Arbitration proceedings.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172594902\" id=\"span_10\">(29 of 31)\n                                                         [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\n     The Bombay High Court in <a href=\"/doc/172594902/\" id=\"a_69\">POL India Projects Ltd. vs.\n\nAurelia Reederei Eugen Friederich GmbH-2015</a> SCC OnLine\n\nBom 1109 faced with somewhat similar situation where the\n\nenforcement of an English Award was sought and the opposite\n\nparty asserted that they were not governed by the English Law\n\nand that there existed no arbitration agreement and that the\n\ncomposition of the arbitration proceeding was not in accordance\n\nwith the agreement, rejected the arguments and held in para 97\n\nas under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            &quot;97.

In proceedings seeking enforcement of the foreign\n\naward and making the foreign award a decree of this Court, this\n\nCourt cannot sit in appeal on the findings recorded by the arbitral\n                                (31 of 31)\n                                                         [ARBAP-88/2016]\n\nTribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">       In view of the analysis of the afore-discussed facts and laws,\n\nthe subject foreign award deserves to be declared as decree of\n\nthis Court and is accordingly so declared. Consequent upon being\n\ndeclared decree of this Court, the said award is binding on the\n\nparties under <a href=\"/doc/1931629/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 46</a> of the Act of 1996 and is now liable to be\n\nenforced under <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 48</a> of the Act. As such the petitioner, upon\n\ntaking further and necessary steps, is entitled to get the same\n\nexecuted as decree of this Court in accordance with relevant\n\nprovisions and the laws.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">       The application is disposed off in the terms indicated above\n\nwith no order as to costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                                     (MOHAMMAD RAFIQ)J.\n\nRS/3\n </p>","numcites":30,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Rajasthan High Court - Jaipur","citetid":136505449,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"declaratory award arbitration","formInput":"declaratory%20award%20arbitration"},{"value":"force majeure","formInput":"force%20majeure"},{"value":"public policy of india","formInput":"public%20policy%20of%20india"},{"value":"public policy","formInput":"public%20policy"},{"value":"enforcement  of foreign awards","formInput":"enforcement%20%20of%20foreign%20awards"},{"value":"compound interest","formInput":"compound%20interest"},{"value":"amitava majumdar","formInput":"amitava%20majumdar"},{"value":"arbitration and conciliation act, 1996","formInput":"arbitration%20and%20conciliation%20act%2C%201996"},{"value":"setting aside of award","formInput":"setting%20aside%20of%20award"},{"value":"patent illegality","formInput":"patent%20illegality"},{"value":"arbitral tribunal ","formInput":"arbitral%20tribunal%20"},{"value":"ashapura minechem ltd","formInput":"ashapura%20minechem%20ltd"},{"value":"appointment of arbitrator/","formInput":"appointment%20of%20arbitrator/"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"arbitral award","formInput":"arbitral%20award"},{"value":"renusagar","formInput":"renusagar"},{"value":"enforceability of award","formInput":"enforceability%20of%20award"},{"value":"foreign awards","formInput":"foreign%20awards"},{"value":"saw pipes","formInput":"saw%20pipes"},{"value":"vessel  filter:  force majeure","formInput":"vessel%20%20filter%3A%20%20force%20majeure"}],"cats":[{"value":"application-for-setting-aside-arbitral-award","formInput":"tag:application-for-setting-aside-arbitral-award"},{"value":"arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:arbitration-agreement"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
