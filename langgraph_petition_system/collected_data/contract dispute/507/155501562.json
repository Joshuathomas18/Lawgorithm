The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) awarded\n\nthe contract for Delhi-Gurgaon Access Controlled Highway NH-8 to\n\nJaypee DSC Venture Limited (JDVL). In order to execute the works of\n\nthe project relating to execution of Pile Foundation, JDVL invited bids\n\nin response to which petitioner submitted a bid dated July 14, 2005.\n\nThe said bid was accepted by Respondent No.1 and vide letter dated\n\nJuly 19,2005, it awarded the work to the petitioner at the bid price of\n\nRs.5,37,58,100/-. VEL also submitted another bid dated October 11,\n\n2005 regarding construction of RTR Palam elevated structure on NH-8\n\nCivil work    for substructure and superstructure.      Respondent No.1\n\nawarded the said work to VEL at the bid price of Rs.25,91,38,559/-.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">4.         In both the contracts stated above, Clause 26 and Clause 30\n\nrespectively deals with the arbitration clause as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;The decision of the M.D. DSCL shall be final and binding\n             on any dispute or difference which may arise between the\n             parties out of or in connection with this Contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.         Certain disputes arose between the parties regarding       the\n\noutstanding bills. By relying on the aforesaid arbitration clause without\n\nprotest or demur, the petitioner herein preferred two separate petitions\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act being OMP No.\n\n524/2007 and 562/2007 before this Court. Both the petitions are\n\npending in this Court. VEL preferred an appeal registered as FAO (OS)\n\nNo.391/2007 against an order dated 28 th September, 2007 in OMP\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Arb. P.

In\n\nOMP No.562/2007, interim order has been passed and the petitioner has\n\nbeen allowed to remove its material and equipment from the site.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">6.          After obtaining orders in the aforesaid petitions from this\n\nCourt, the petitioner vide letter dated 08.01.2008 wrote to the MD,DSC\n\ni.e. arbitrator named in the contract and required him to, inter alia,\n\nappoint an independent arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">7.          The said named arbitrator, vide letter dated 25.01.2008\n\nentered into the reference in view of the fact that he had been named as\n\narbitrator in the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">8.          However, in February, 2008 the petitioner filed the present\n\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1758564/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 11(6) (c)</a> of the Act for appointment of arbitrator.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">9.          The learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon <a href=\"/doc/1758564/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n11(6)(c)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It is alleged that\n\nthe arbitrator has failed to perform his function entrusted to him and also\n\nfailed to perform any functions under the procedure set out in the clause\n\nrelating to settlement disputes. The petitioner alleged that the Arbitrator\n\nnamed in the arbitration clause in both the contracts executed between\n\nthe parties is biased as he is also involved in stopping the certified bills\n\nof the petitioner and stopped releasing the payments to the petitioner. It\n\nis argued that referring the present disputes between the parties wherein\n\nthe named arbitrator is in close relation of the respondent company is\n\ntotally impermissible and against the principles of equity, justice and\n\ngood conscience. In fact the respondent No.1 is a closely held company\n\nof the Narula family. The structure of Respondent No.1 clearly denotes\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Arb. P. No.90/2008                                                Page 3 of 15</span>\n that it stands on the family pyramid. The respondent No.2 cannot be\n\nArbitrator in his own actions, he is an interested party being the\n\nManaging Director of Respondent no.1 more so, in the context of the\n\ndispute relating to the encashment of the bank guarantees, settlement/\n\ncertifying of the     bills, demobilization of equipment, release of\n\noutstanding payment etc, the respondent No.2 is not impartial and is\n\nbiased against the petitioner.    Besides the respondent No. has been\n\nactively and personally involved in respect of the disputes            and\n\ndifferences     between the   parties at each and every stage.         The\n\nrespondent No.2 has in fact acted as an opposite party and rejected the\n\nclaims of the petitioner, as orally conveyed in the meetings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">10.        It is further alleged that though the clause 26 and 30 of the\n\ncontracts satisfy the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1534152/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 7(4)</a> of the Act and thus\n\nconstitute an arbitration agreement, but normally the connotation and\n\nsequence of an arbitration clause is distinct and different. Following\n\naverment has been made by the petitioner in this context :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          &quot;7. A bare look at the Arbitration       clause    reveals   the\n          following salient characteristics :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          (i)   Normally, the arbitration clause is worded as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          &quot;     Any dispute or difference that may arise between the\n                parties arising out of the contract or in relation thereto\n                shall be referred to arbitration of ____(nominated\n                arbitrator-name/designation), whose decision shall be\n                final and binding.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          (ii) The said clause i.e. &quot;Settlement of Dispute&quot; is notably\n               different in its character and tenor from the normal\n               arbitration clauses.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          (iii) It is styled and nomenclature as &quot;Settlement of Disputes&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">          (iv) It makes no reference as to the appointment of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Arb.

It is further alleged that the Managing Director of DSCL\n\nfailed to take a decision      on time and instead invoked the bank\n\nguarantees. It is averred that a person who has acted personally against\n\nthe petitioner cannot now act as non-partisan and thus cannot be\n\npermitted to be the Judge or Jury as well as and the audience.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1758564/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 11(6) (c)</a> has no application in the facts of the present case.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1758564/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11 (6) (c)</a> reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             &quot;11.

Consequently, there was no occasion for invoking\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1758564/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11 (6) (c)</a> and the present petition is liable to be dismissed on\n\nthis ground alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">14.            The present petition is not maintainable as the conditions\n\nprecedent to the invocation of jurisdiction of this Court to appoint\n\narbitrator have not been fulfilled. It is settled law that in case of a\n\nnamed arbitrator, reference has to be made to him and a party is\n\nprecluded from approaching the Court for appointing an arbitrator other\n\nthan the named arbitrator.

Regarding the contention of the petitioner that the arbitration\n\nclause in the present case is worded differently from the wording\n\n&quot;normally&quot; used in arbitration clauses contained in other contracts, it is\n\nsubmitted that by filing petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 9</a> of the Act and the\n\npresent petition under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 11</a> of the Act, the petitioner has admitted\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Arb.

It is apparent from the provision of <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Act\n\nthat it applies only when    a party or person concerned have failed to\n\nact in terms of the arbitration agreement. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1997730\" id=\"span_15\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1997730/\" id=\"a_24\">Yashwith\n\nConstructions (P) Ltd. vs. Simplex Concrete Piles India Ltd. &amp; Anr.</a>,\n\n(2006) 6 SCC 204 following observations were made in para 4 :</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">             &quot;4.........

Obviously, <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n             11(6)</a> of the Act has application only when a party or the\n             person concerned had failed to act in terms of the\n             arbitration agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">20.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1589968\" id=\"span_16\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1589968/\" id=\"a_27\">Ace Pipeline Contracts (P) Ltd. vs. Bharat\n\nPetroleum Corpn.

However, in large number of cases, it is found that it would not\n\nbe conducive in the interest of parties or for any other reasons to be\n\nrecorded in writing and that the choice of arbitrator can go beyond the\n\ndesignated persons or institutions in appropriate cases. But the court\n\nshould normally adhere to the terms of arbitration clause except in\n\nexceptional cases for reasons to be recorded or where both parties\n\nagree for a common name.

In the case of The Iron and Steel Company Ltd. v.

If the parites\n\nhave agreed on a procedure for appointing the Arbitrator or Arbitrators\n\nas contemplated by sub-section (2) thereof, then the dispute between the\n\nparties has to be decided in accordance with the said procedure and\n\nrecourse to the Chief Justice or his designate cannot be taken\n\nstraightway. A party can approach the Chief Justice or his designate\n\nonly if the parties have not agreed on a procedure for appointing the\n\nArbitrator as contemplated by sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 11</a> or in case\n\nthe various contingencies provided for in sub-section (6) have arisen. In\n\nthis case, the agreement executed between the parties contains an\n\narbitration clause and Cl. 13.1 clearly provides that all disputes and\n\ndifferences whatsoever arising between the parties out of or relating to\n\nthe construction, meaning and operation or effect of the contract or the\n\nbreach thereof shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the\n\nRules of Arbitration of the Indian Council of Arbitration and the award\n\nmade in pursuance thereof shall be binding on the parties.

The stage for invoking\n\nsub-section (6) of<a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_34\"> S. 11</a> had also not arrived. In these circumstances, the\n\napplication for appointment of Arbitrator moved by the respondent before\n\nthe City Civil Court, which was a Designated Authority in accordance\n\nwith the scheme framed by the Chief Justice was held to be not\n\nmaintainable at all and the City Civil Court had no jurisdiction or\n\nauthority to appoint an Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133070\" id=\"span_19\">22.        As regards the submissions raised by the petitioner about the\n\nconnotation and      sequence of arbitration clause is concerned, it has\n\ncategorically held in the case of <a href=\"/doc/133070/\" id=\"a_35\">Punjab State and Others vs. Dina Nath</a>\n\n(2007) 5 Supreme Court Cases 28 that arbitration agreement need not be\n\nin any particular form. However, it must indicate that the parties had agreed\n\nthat any dispute arising between them in respect of the subject-matter of the\n\ncontract, should be referred to arbitration. Moreover, it must be in writing\n\nand must indicate the intention of the parties to treat the decision of the\n\narbitrator as final. If those requirements are satisfied, the mere absence of\n\nthe words „arbitration‟ or „arbitrator‟ therein cannot be a ground to hold that\n\nthe agreement in question was not an arbitration agreement. A clause in the\n\nagreement in the Work Order providing that any dispute arising between the\n\nprincipal and the contractor should be referred to Superintending Engineer\n\nfor his orders and that his decision would be final and binding on the\n\nparties, held, was a binding arbitration agreement. Further held, the words\n\n„any dispute‟ occurring therein were wide enough to cover all disputes\n\nrelating to the Work Order including a dispute relating to non-payment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Arb. P. No.90/2008                                              Page 10 of 15</span>\n of money after completion of the work. The word „orders‟ implied some\n\nexpression of opinion by the Superintending Engineer which would be\n\nenforceable. The Supreme Court while dealing with the similar dispute in\n\nthe present case made the following observations in paras 8, 10, 12 and 14\n\nwherein the clause in dispute is as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              &quot;Any dispute arising between the department and the\n             contractor/ society shall be referred to the Superintending\n             Engineer, Anandpur Sahib, Hydel Circle No. 1, Chandigarh\n             for orders and his decision will be final and\n             acceptable/binding on both the parties&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979603\" id=\"span_21\">&quot;8. A bare perusal of the definition of arbitration\n             agreement would clearly show that an arbitration agreement\n             is not required to be in any particular form. What is\n             required to be ascertained is whether the parties have\n             agreed that if any dispute arises between them in respect of\n             the subject-matter of the contract, such dispute shall be\n             referred to arbitration. In that case, such agreement would\n             certainly spell out an arbitration agreement. (See\n             <a href=\"/doc/1979603/\" id=\"a_36\">Rukmanibai Gupta v. Collector</a> AIR 1981 SC 479)\n             However, from the definition of the arbitration agreement,\n             it is also clear that the agreement must be in writing and to\n             interpret the agreement as an &quot;arbitration agreement&quot; one\n             has to ascertain the intention of the parties and also\n             treatment of the decision as final. If the parties had desired\n             and intended that a dispute must be referred to arbitration\n             for decision and they would undertake to abide by that\n             decision, there cannot be any difficulty to hold that the\n             intention of the parties was to have an arbitration\n             agreement, that is to say, an arbitration agreement\n             immediately comes into existence.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">             xxxxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">             10. We have already noted clause 4 of the Work Order as\n             discussed hereinabove.

The essential requirements as\n             pointed out herein earlier are that the parties have intended\n             to make a reference to an arbitration and treat the decision\n             of the arbitrator as final.

Keeping the ingredients as indicated by this Court in\n            K.K.

The words &quot;any dispute&quot; appears in clause 4 of the\n            Work Order. Therefore, only on the basis of the materials\n            produced by the parties in support of their respective claims\n            a decision can be arrived at in resolving the dispute\n            between the parties. The use of the words &quot;any dispute&quot; in\n            clause 4 of the Work Order is wide enough to include all\n            disputes relating to the said Work Order. Therefore, when a\n            party raises a dispute for non-payment of money after\n            completion of the work, which is denied by the other party,\n            such a dispute would come within the meaning of\n            &quot;arbitration agreement&quot; between the parties. Clause 4 of the\n            Work Order also clearly provides that any dispute between\n            the department and the contractor shall be referred to the\n            Superintending Engineer, Hydel Circle No. 1, Chandigarh\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Arb.

The word &quot;orders&quot; would indicate some\n             expression of opinion, which is to be carried out, or\n             enforced and which is a conclusion of a body (in this case\n             Superintending Engineer, Hydel Circle No. 1, Chandigarh).\n             Then again the conclusion and decision of the\n             Superintending Engineer will be final and binding on both\n             the parties. This being the position in the present case and\n             in view of the fact that clause 4 of the Work Order is not\n             under challenge before us, the decision that would be\n             arrived at by Superintending Engineer, Hydel Circle No. 1,\n             Chandigarh must also be binding on the parties as a result\n             whereof clause 4 must be held to be a binding arbitration\n             agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">23.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"344153\" id=\"span_25\">In <a href=\"/doc/344153/\" id=\"a_40\">State of U.P. v.

It came to the conclusion by interpretation of that\n\nclause that there did not exist any arbitration agreement as the decision\n\nof the Superintending Engineer in connection with the work done by the\n\ncontractor was meant for supervision and execution of the work and\n\nadministrative control over it from time to time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">25.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48449\" id=\"span_27\">In <a href=\"/doc/48449/\" id=\"a_41\">Bihar State Mineral Development Corpn. v.
