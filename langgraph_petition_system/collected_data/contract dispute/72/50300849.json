It is on that basis\n\n     that the employer had entrusted those works to\n\n     labour contractors for lumpsum amount by entering\n\n     into contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.   The contractors are alleged to have engaged their\n\n     own men to carry out the said work. The house-\n\n     keeping    and   gardening   work   was   entrusted    to\n\n     &quot;Sri.Shankar Nursery (associated)&quot;, work of loading\n\n     and unloading was entrusted to &quot;M/s Associated\n\n     Detective &amp; Security Services&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.

The persons engaged by Sri Shankar and M/s\n\n     Associated Detective &amp; Security Services had filed a\n\n     petition on 31.03.1999 through the respondent Union\n\n     before     the   Deputy     Labour      Commissioner        for    a\n\n     declaration that the workers whose names are\n\n     mentioned        in   Annexure-A       thereto       were   always\n\n     employees of the employer and therefore they are\n\n     entitled to get all the benefits as applicable to the\n\n     permanent workmen from the date of their joining\n\n     service.    It was contended that the said workers\n\n     were discharging their work which were perennial in\n\n     nature along with other permanent workmen and\n\n     therefore    they     are   entitled     to    be    declared     as\n\n     permanent workmen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">8.   The   employer         opposed     the        said   petition     by\n\n     contending that the persons named in annexure to\n\n     the petition were not discharging their jobs as\n\n     mentioned against their name, the employer does\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                -5-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                            WP No. 3788 of 2012</span>\n\n\n\n\n      not even know them.          The work entrusted to the\n\n      contractors was house-keeping, gardening, loading\n\n      and unloading which required only few hours of work\n\n      in a day and therefore, the same cannot be said to\n\n      be perennial in nature and therefore, they were not\n\n      entitled to be treated as permanent workmen.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">9.

During the pendency of the said adjudication 19 of\n\n      66       workmen       raised    a      conciliation   proceeding\n\n      contending that employer had refused them work\n\n      from February 2000, which was opposed by the\n\n      employer         contending      that     they   are   not   even\n\n      employees of the company, hence, the question of\n\n      refusing them work would not arise. This issue was\n\n      also referred to conciliation which ended in a failure.\n\n      The State government vide order dated 7.03.2001\n\n      referred this dispute for adjudication on the question.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                &quot;Whether the management of Mysore Electrical\n             Industries Limited, Tumkur Road, Bangalore was\n             justified in refusing work to 19 contract workers, if not\n             what relief that the said workers entitled to?\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">12.

While the matter was pending, the Union filed an\n\n      interlocutory   application   on    14.12.2000         under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/31217/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 11</a> of the ID Act seeking for a direction to the\n\n      employer to restore the services of the workmen\n\n      listed in the annexure to the affidavit.

When,\nin such circumstances, the workmen concerned raise\nan industrial dispute for relief that they should be\ndeemed to be the employees of the principal\nemployer, the court or the industrial adjudicator will\nhave jurisdiction to entertain the dispute and grant\nthe necessary relief.

When such dispute is\nraised, the industrial adjudicator has to decide\nwhether the contract is a sham or genuine.

However, he can do\nso if the dispute is espoused by the direct workmen of\nthe principal employer. If the workmen of the principal\nemployer have not espoused the dispute, the\nadjudicator, after coming to the conclusion that the\ncontract is genuine, has to reject the reference, the\ndispute being not an industrial dispute within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(k)</a> of the ID Act. He will not be\ncompetent to give any relief to the workmen of the\nerstwhile contractor even if the labour contract is\nabolished by the appropriate Government under\n<a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 10</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">(iii) If the labour contract is genuine a composite\nindustrial dispute can still be raised for abolition of the\ncontract labour and their absorption. However, the\ndispute will have to be raised invariably by the direct\nemployees of the principal employer. The industrial\nadjudicator, after receipt of the reference of such\ndispute will have first to direct the workmen to\napproach the appropriate Government for abolition of\nthe contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 10</a> of the Act and\nkeep the reference pending. If pursuant to such\nreference, the contract labour is abolished by the\nappropriate Government, the industrial adjudicator will\nhave to give opportunity to the parties to place the\nnecessary material before him to decide whether the\nworkmen of the erstwhile contractor should be\ndirected to be absorbed by the principal employer,\nhow many of them and on what terms. If, however,\nthe contract labour is not abolished, the industrial\nadjudicator has to reject the reference.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">(iv) Even after the contract labour system is abolished,\nthe direct employees of the principal employer can\nraise an industrial dispute for absorption of the ex-\ncontractor&#x27;s workmen and the adjudicator on the\nmaterial placed before him can decide as to who and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">                     - 20 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                  WP No. 3788 of 2012</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">\n\n\n\n\nhow many of the workmen should be absorbed and on\nwhat terms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">54.

As regards the present civil appeal, the\nfacts of which have already been referred to earlier,\nShri Venugopal, the learned counsel for the appellant-\nBoard contended that none of the direct workmen of\nthe Board had espoused the cause of the contract\nlabour and hence the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to\nentertain the reference. He also submitted that any\namount of consent by the appellant-Board for such a\nreference will not confer jurisdiction on the Tribunal to\nentertain the reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">55. As has been pointed out earlier, the order of\nreference of the dispute to the Tribunal was made by\nthe State Government on the basis of a joint\napplication for reference under <a href=\"/doc/1871842/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 10(2)</a> of the\nID Act. The application was duly signed by the\npresent appellant-Board, all the seven contractors\ninvolved in the dispute and by the then Surat Labour\nUnion which had both direct as well as contract\nlabourers, as its members. The respondent-Union is\nthe successor of the said Surat Labour Union. These\nfacts show two things, viz., that contrary to the\nsubmission made by the learned counsel, the direct\nemployees of the Board had espoused the cause of\nthe contract labourers, and the appellant-Board had\nalso accepted the fact that the dispute in question\nwas raised and supported also by the said employees.\nNo objection was taken before the Tribunal or the\nHigh Court either to the order of reference or to the\nadjudication of the dispute by the Tribunal that the\ndispute was not espoused by the direct employees of\nthe appellant-Board.

Apart from the\nfact, therefore, that the Board had signed the joint\napplication for reference and therefore it cannot in an\nappeal by special leave under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 136</a> of the\nConstitution for the first time raise the question which\nis a mixed question of law and fact, we are of the\nview that even on facts as they stand, it will have to\nbe held that the dispute was in fact espoused by the\ndirect employees of the appellant-Board. We therefore\nreject the said contention.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_51\">56. It was next contended that the dispute raised by\nthe workmen was for abolition of the contract and\nsuch a dispute could not have been entertained by the\nTribunal in view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 10</a> of the\nAct. For this purpose, the learned counsel relied upon\nclause (1) of the order of reference. We find nothing\nin the said clause which supports the contention of\nthe learned counsel. The clause reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;Whether the workers whose services are engaged by\nthe contractors, but who are working in the Thermal\nPower Station of Gujarat Electricity Board at Ukai, can\nlegally claim to be the employees of the Gujarat\nElectricity Board?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">It will be obvious from a reading of the said clause\nthat what in fact is referred for adjudication is the\ndetermination of the status of the workmen, viz.,\nwhether though engaged by the contractors, they are\nlegally the workmen of the appellant-Board? In other\nwords, implicit in the said clause is the assertion of\nthe workmen that they are in law the workmen of the\nappellant-Board and not of the contractors, and they\nwanted the Tribunal to decide their exact legal status.\nThis is clear also from the statement of claim filed by\nthe workmen in support of their demand. In para 3 of\nthe statement of claim, it is averred that the Board\nhas been employing Mukadam Supervisors &quot;who are\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                     - 22 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                 WP No. 3788 of 2012</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\n\n\n\n\ndraped in different paper arrangements and are now\nknown as contractors of the Thermal Power Station&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">and the Board and the so-called contractors have\njoined hands for mass victimisation and termination of\nservices even without payment of due wages. Again,\nin para 5 of the statement of claim, it is stated that\nthe workmen are being paid wages by the\nManagement of the Board through Mukadam\nSupervisors now known as contractors of the Board.\nThe contractors come and go but the workmen are\nworking throughout since the inception of the Thermal\nPower Station. The control, direction and initiation of\nthese workmen are in the hands of the supervisors\nand technical staff of the Thermal Power Station. It is\nalso alleged in the said para that the so-called\ncontractors are not contractors as none of them have\ntaken licence. It is also averred there that it is\nabundantly clear that the workmen employed to\nperform the permanent and perennial nature of duties\nare the employees of the Board. In para 10 of the\nstatement of claim, it is prayed that &quot;the Tribunal\nshould hold and declare that the workers deployed in\nthe Thermal Power Station under the garb of\ncontractor are the permanent employees of the\nThermal Power Station managed and controlled by the\nappellant-Board&quot;. In para 6 of the application for\ninterim relief which was filed on behalf of the\nworkmen, it was averred that the Board was through\ndifferent agreements showing the workmen as if they\nwere working under some intermediaries and the said\nintermediaries are &quot;make-believe trappings&quot; and are\n&#x27;dubious&#x27; in nature and it was only to deprive the\nworkmen of the benefits which are available to the\nemployees of the Board that the said &quot;make-believe\ntrappings&quot; were employed by the Board. It is\ntherefore not correct to say that the present reference\nwas for the abolition of the contract. The reference,\non the other hand, was for a declaration that the\nworkmen were in fact and in law the employees of the\nappellant-Board and that they should be given the\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                     - 23 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  WP No. 3788 of 2012</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">service conditions as are available to the direct\nemployees of the Board.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">57. It was then contended by the learned counsel\nthat the Industrial Tribunal has nowhere recorded a\nfinding that the contract in question was a sham, a\ncamouflage, a make-believe or a subterfuge. On the\ncontrary, according to him, the Tribunal has held that\nthe contract labour of each of the contractors must be\ndeemed to be the employees of the appellant-Board,\nfirstly because the Board and the contractors had not\nproduced valid proof of the registration certificate and\nthe licences respectively, relying on the decisions of\nthe Madras and Karnataka High Courts, and secondly,\nbecause of the nature of the work. He submitted that\nthe decisions of the Madras and Karnataka High\nCourts have been expressly overruled by this Court in\nDena Nath case [(1992) 1 SCC 695 : 1992 SCC (L&amp;S)\n349] . As regards the nature of work, the exclusive\njurisdiction to record a finding in that behalf is of the\nappropriate Government under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 10</a> of the Act\nand the Tribunal is precluded from recording a finding\nin that behalf and abolishing the contract on the basis\nof such finding. In fact, the Tribunal has no\njurisdiction to abolish the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">58. In the first instance, we find that the contention\nthat the Tribunal has held that the workmen in\nquestion are the employees of the Board only because\nof the non-production of the valid proof of the\ncertificate and the licences in question, is not correct.\nThe Tribunal has, on the basis of the evidence on\nrecord, come to the conclusions, among others, that\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">(i) the work was being done on the premises of the\nBoard itself as the coal was being used for the\npurposes of the Board, viz., generation of electricity;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">(ii) the workmen were broadly under the control of\nthe Board; (iii) there was overall supervision of the\nwork by the officers of the Board; (iv) the work was of\na continuous nature; and (v) the work was an integral\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">                     - 24 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 WP No. 3788 of 2012</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n\n\n\npart of the overall work to be executed for the\npurposes of the generation of the electricity and that\nit had to be performed within specified time-limits as\npart of the integrated process. The Tribunal has also\nin this connection referred to a decision of this Court\nreported in Hussainbhai case [(1978) 4 SCC 257 :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">1978 SCC (L&amp;S) 506] to support its conclusion that in\nthe aforesaid circumstances found by it, the workmen\nin question were the employees of the Board. It is\ntrue that the Tribunal has not in so many words\nrecorded a finding that the contract was a sham or\nbogus or a camouflage to conceal the real facts. It is\nalso true that the Tribunal has referred to the\ndecisions of the Madras and Karnataka High Courts\nand on its finding that the Board and the contractors\nhad not produced valid proof of the registration\ncertificate and the licences for the relevant period has\nheld that the workmen should be deemed to be the\nemployees of the Board. However, the decision of the\nTribunal has to be read as a whole. Thus read, the\ndecision makes it clear that the Tribunal has based its\nconclusion both on the ground that the workmen were\nin fact engaged by the appellant-Board and not by the\ncontractors who were merely intermediaries set up by\nthe Board and also on the ground that there was no\nvalid proof of the registration certificate and the\nlicences in the possession of the Board and the\ncontractors respectively. It is not, therefore, correct\nto say that the decision of the Tribunal is based only\non the latter ground. We are of the view that there is\na factual finding recorded by the Tribunal that the\nlabour contracts in question were not genuine and the\ndecision of the Tribunal is based on this ground as\nwell.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">59.

If no such question\n     arises, the finding recorded by the Court or the\n     Tribunal in that behalf is not ineffective or invalid.\n     Further, in all such cases, the Tribunal is called upon\n     to record a finding on the factors in question not for\n     abolishing the contract but to find out whether the\n     contract is a sham or otherwise. The contract may be\n     genuine even where all the said factors are present.\n     What is prohibited by <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 10</a> is the abolition of the\n     contract except by the appropriate Government, after\n     taking into consideration the said factors, and not the\n     recording of the finding on the basis of the said\n     factors, that the contract is a sham or bogus.\n\n\n\n\n16.9. By relying on the above decision, he submits that\n\n     the abolition of contract labour by issuance of\n\n     notification under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA comes\n\n     into play when there exists a genuine contract. If\n\n     there is no genuine contract and the contract is a\n\n     sham or     camouflage to hide         the   reality, the\n\n     provision of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 10</a> would not be applicable. In\n\n     such circumstances, if the workmen raise industrial\n\n     dispute, they should deem to be employees of the\n\n     principal employer.

The Tribunal has got every power\nto adjudicate an industrial dispute and impose upon\nthe employer new obligations to strike a balance\nand secure industrial peace and harmony between\nthe employer and workmen and ultimately deliver\nsocial justice which is the constitutional mandate as\nheld by the Constitution Bench of this Court in a\ncatena of cases.

It has not merely to\ninterpret or give effect to the contractual rights and\nobligations of the parties. It can create new rights\nand obligations between them which it considers\nessential for keeping industrial peace. An industrial\ndispute as has been said on many occasions is\nnothing but a trial of strength between the\nemployers on the one hand and the workmen&#x27;s\norganisation on the other and the Industrial\nTribunal has got to arrive at some equitable\narrangement for averting strikes and lock-outs\nwhich impede production of goods and the\nindustrial development of the country. The Tribunal\nis not bound by the rigid rules of law. The process it\nemploys is rather an extended form of the process\nof collective bargaining and is more akin to\nadministrative than to judicial function. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1109872\" id=\"span_40\">In\ndescribing the true position of an Industrial Tribunal\nin dealing with labour disputes, this Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1109872/\" id=\"a_41\">Western India Automobile Assn. v.

A perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 10</a> would indicate that the\n\n     State Government can in certain cases prohibit\n\n     contract labour which would necessarily mean\n\n     that it is only as regards the areas where State\n\n     government    by      exercise    of   powers   under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 10</a> can prohibit it.

Merely because there is\n\n     no notification under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 10</a> of CLRA, the\n\n     same would not permit an employer who is not\n\n     registered under <a href=\"/doc/1150040/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 7</a> to enter into a\n\n     contract for contract labour with a contractor\n\n     who is not registered under <a href=\"/doc/1570927/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 12</a>.

It is also on\n\n     record that employer has not registered himself\n\n     under Section 7 of CLRA and the contractor has\n\n     not registered under Section 12 of CLRA, let\n\n     alone the labour being registered under the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">                         - 40 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                   WP No. 3788 of 2012</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">\n\n\n\n\n     contractor as contract labour.     Thereafter the\n\n     contractor terminated the contract which was\n\n     accepted by the employer resulting in the\n\n     workers    being    without   employment.    The\n\n     tribunal has come to a categorical finding that\n\n     the so-called agreement between the employer\n\n     and contractor is a sham agreement entered\n\n     into with the sole purpose and intention of\n\n     making payment of lesser amount to the\n\n     workers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_119\">21.8.

A perusal of the list\n\n     of document produced before the Industrial\n\n     Tribunal would establish that there is no such\n\n     agreement between the employer and the\n\n     contractors which has been produced before the\n\n     Industrial Tribunal.
