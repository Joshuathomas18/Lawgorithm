However, the first\n                          and foremost feature is that there is no application under <a href=\"/doc/152000290/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8</a> of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Digitally Signed          CS(COMM) 534/2023                                                         Page 5 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">By:DHIRENDER KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">20:25:38</span>\n                           <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_8\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, which has been filed by Defendant.\n                          The written statement has also not been filed and no reply in the application\n                          bearing no.

The question that arises is whether this Settlement Agreement\n                          supersedes the original contracts or not. For the said purpose, it needs to be\n                          noted that the original contract was for executing civil, structural, internal\n                          finishing work together with the external development and boundary wall.\n                          The nature of the said contract was, therefore, one wherein the Plaintiff was\n                          to render services to the Defendant.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Digitally Signed          CS(COMM) 534/2023                                                     Page 9 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">By:DHIRENDER KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">20:25:38</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">                           16.      However, under the Settlement Agreement the complete nature of the\n                          settlement itself is different i.e. there is an acknowledgment of the amount\n                          payable, apartments to be given to the Plaintiff and the bank guarantees were\n                          to be released. The original bank guarantees have, in fact, been released. The\n                          Settlement Agreement records that this would be a foreclosure document\n                          and a full and final settlement and hence, no further work is to be executed\n                          by the Plaintiff in the said project. Under such circumstances, the question\n                          raised is whether the arbitration clause would survive.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                          17.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_9\">Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta and Bros</a>. 1959 SCC OnLine\n                          SC 6, a similar question arose as to the survival of an arbitration clause in a\n                          contract after the said contract is superseded by the execution of a\n                          Settlement Agreement. The Court in the said case observed that the\n                          arbitration clause perished with the original contract, and it is inconceivable\n                          that the parties intended its survival even after the contract was mutually\n                          rescinded and substituted by new agreement. The Court thereafter also laid\n                          down certain principles.

If so, the next question is whether the arbitration\n                                      clause of the original contracts survived after the\n                                      execution of the settlement contract dated February 22,\n                                      1949. The learned counsel for the appellant contends\n                                      that the forms of the arbitration clause are wide and\n                                      comprehensive, and any dispute on the question\n                                      whether the said contract was discharged by any of the\n                                      ways known to law came within its fold.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                                      8. Uninfluenced by authorities or case-law, the logical\n                                      outcome of the earlier discussion would be that the\n                                      arbitration clause perished with the original contract.\n                                      Whether the said clause was a substantive term or a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">Digitally Signed          CS(COMM) 534/2023                                                     Page 10 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">By:DHIRENDER KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">20:25:38</span>\n                                     collateral one, it was nonetheless an integral part of\n                                    the contract, which had no existence de hors the\n                                    contract.

The same has been elucidated in the following manner:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                                    &quot;7. The contention that has been canvassed before us\n                                    is that as there has been a full and final settlement\n                                    under the contract, the rights and obligations under\n                                    the contract do not subsist and consequently the\n                                    arbitration clause also perishes along with the\n                                    settlement. If so, the dispute whether there has or has\n                                    not been a settlement cannot be the subject of an\n                                    arbitration. There is, in our view, a basic fallacy\n                                    underlying this submission. A contract is the creature\n                                    of an agreement between the parties and where the\n                                    parties under the terms of the contract agree to\n                                    incorporate an arbitration clause, that clause stands\n                                    apart from the rights and obligations under that\n                                    contract, as it has been incorporated with the object of\n                                    providing a machinery for the settlement of disputes\n                                    arising in relation to or in connection with that\n                                    contract. The questions of unilateral repudiation of the\n                                    rights and obligations under the contract or of a full\n                                    and final settlement of the contract relate to the\n                                    performance or discharge of the contract. Far from\n                                    putting an end to the arbitration clause, they fall within\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Digitally Signed          CS(COMM) 534/2023                                                      Page 12 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">By:DHIRENDER KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">20:25:38</span>\n                                     the purview of it. A repudiation by one party alone\n                                    does not terminate the contract. It takes two to end it,\n                                    and hence it follows that as the contract subsists for\n                                    the determination of the rights and obligations of the\n                                    parties, the arbitration clause also survives. This is not\n                                    a case where the plea is that the contract is void,\n                                    illegal or fraudulent etc. in which case, the entire\n                                    contract along with the arbitration clause is non est, or\n                                    voidable. As the contract is an outcome of the\n                                    agreement between the parties it is equally open to the\n                                    parties thereto to agree to bring it to an end or to treat\n                                    it as if it never existed. It may also be open to the\n                                    parties to terminate the previous contract and\n                                    substitute in its place a new contract or alter the\n                                    original contract in such a way that it cannot subsist.\n                                    In all these cases, since the entire contract is put an\n                                    end to, the arbitration clause, which is a part of it,\n                                    also perishes along with it. <a href=\"/doc/595325/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 62</a> of the Contract\n                                    Act incorporates this principle when it provides that if\n                                    the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new\n                                    contract or to rescind or alter it, the original contract\n                                    need not be performed. Where, therefore, the dispute\n                                    between the parties is that the contract itself does not\n                                    subsist either as a result of its being substituted by a\n                                    new contract or by rescission or alteration, that\n                                    dispute cannot be referred to the arbitration as the\n                                    arbitration clause itself would perish if the averment\n                                    is found to be valid. As the very jurisdiction of the\n                                    arbitrator is dependent upon the existence of the\n                                    arbitration clause under which he is appointed, the\n                                    parties have no right to invoke a clause which\n                                    perishes with the contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                                    8.

In such a situation the rescission would put\n                                    an end to the performance of the contract in future, but\n                                    it may remain alive for claiming damages either for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Digitally Signed          CS(COMM) 534/2023                                                      Page 13 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">By:DHIRENDER KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">20:25:38</span>\n                                     previous breaches or for the breach which constituted\n                                    the termination.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                                    9. We have adverted to these several aspects merely to\n                                    show that contracts being consensual, the question\n                                    whether the arbitration clause survives or perishes\n                                    would depend upon the nature of the controversy and\n                                    its effect upon the existence or survival of the\n                                    contract itself. In other words, where the binding\n                                    nature of the contract is not disputed, but a difference\n                                    has arisen between the parties thereto as to whether\n                                    there has been a breach by one side or the other or\n                                    whether one or both the parties have been discharged\n                                    from further performance such differences are\n                                    &quot;upon&quot;, &quot;in relation to&quot; or &quot;in connection with the\n                                    contract. That a contract has come to an end by\n                                    frustration does not put an end to the contract for all\n                                    purposes, because there may be rights and obligations\n                                    which had arisen earlier when it had not come to an\n                                    end, as it is only the future performance of the contract\n                                    that has come to an end. It is, therefore, clear that a\n                                    dispute as to the binding nature of the contract cannot\n                                    be determined by resort to arbitration, because as we\n                                    have stated earlier, the arbitration clause itself stands\n                                    or falls according to the determination of the question\n                                    in dispute. .......&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                          19.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545494\" id=\"span_72\">In <a href=\"/doc/1545494/\" id=\"a_13\">Damodar Valley</a> (supra) the entire law on the subject was\n                          discussed and it was categorically held that if there has been termination of a\n                          contract unilaterally, the claim of damages can be made under the\n                          Arbitration Clause.

The relevant portion of the decision is extracted\n                          below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"209845\" id=\"span_78\">&quot;3.

If this is permitted the sanctity of contract, the\n                                    settlement also being a contract, would be wholly lost\n                                    and it would be open to one party to take the benefit\n                                    under the settlement and then to question the same on\n                                    the ground of mistake without having the settlement\n                                    set aside.

If there is unilateral\n                          repudiation, then the arbitration clause may survive depending on the\n                          facts. In the present case there is no arbitrable dispute left between the\n                          parties as the Settlement Agreement states that the agreement is in complete\n                          satisfaction of claims and demands under the Contract.

An arbitration clause contained in an agreement\n                                    which is void ab initio cannot be enforced as the\n                                    contract itself never legally came into existence.\n                                     b.
