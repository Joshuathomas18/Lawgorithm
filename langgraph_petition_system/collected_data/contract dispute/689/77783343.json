The COA required the transportation of 2,000,000 metric tons (±5%)\n                            of coking coal from April 2008 to December 2012, with an option for SAIL\n                            to extend the period to March 2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">                            12.   The COA was amended at SAIL&#x27;s request via Addendum No. 1, dated\n                            29.06.2010. Addendum No. 1 allowed SAIL to load Panamax shipments\n                            (75,000 metric tons ±5%) instead of Handymax shipments, reduced the\n                            freight rate for Panamax shipments from USD 40.00 to USD 34.00 per\n                            metric ton, lowered the additional freight for a second discharge port, and\n                            expanded the loading area to include ports in New South Wales. Seaspray\n                            agreed to these changes.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019               Page 5 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">14:19:18</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                             13.

Seaspray asserts that SAIL has only transported\n                            881,204.80 metric tons out of the required 2,000,000 metric tons (±5%)\n                            under the COA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                            14.

On 06.05.2011, Seaspray, through Brokers, emailed SAIL that the\n                            16th cargo under COA was due in June 2011 and requested a suitable stem.\n                            SAIL did not respond. Subsequent emails were sent by Seaspray through\n                            Brokers on 25.05.2011, 01.06.2011, and 28.06.2011, reiterating the request\n                            for the 16th cargo and noting SAIL&#x27;s frequent entries into the spot market\n                            for June/July stems. Again, SAIL did not reply.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">                            17.   Seaspray addressed the issue again via email on 04.07.2011 and, more\n                            specifically, emphasised SAIL&#x27;s entry into the spot market with two 75,000-\n                            ton stems for late July from Queensland and SAIL&#x27;s non-compliance with\n                            the COA terms. On 21.07.2011, Seaspray learned that SAIL had fixed a\n                            cargo from Australia to India for a third party, contrary to the COA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">                            18.

SAIL replied to the legal notice denying all Seaspray&#x27;s claims and\n                            alleging that Seaspray itself has been in breach of the COA. By e-mail dated\n                            03.11.2011, Seaspray submitted their claim of USD 929,958.75 for the 18th\n                            shipment based on the prevailing market rate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">                            21.

On 22.05.2012, Seaspray filed a Statement of Claim, alleging that\n                            SAIL had failed to supply cargo as per the COA. Subsequently, on\n                            11.09.2012, SAIL reduced the shipment quantity by 5%. On the same day,\n                            SAIL sent another fax message terminating the Agreement, citing the\n                            &quot;Default Clause,&quot; which led to a dispute. Seaspray contended that SAIL had\n                            no unilateral right to terminate the Agreement, while SAIL argued that such\n                            a right was provided under Clause 62 of the COA. SAIL filed a Statement of\n                            Defence on 21.09.2012, and Seaspray submitted a rejoinder on 03.01.2013.\n                            SAIL further filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 16</a> of the A&amp;C Act on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019              Page 7 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">14:19:18</span>\n                             22.09.2012.

Seaspray&#x27;s claim in its statement of claim sought damages for the\n                            non-supply of 1,118,795.20 metric tons (MT) of cargo from June 2011 to\n                            December 2012. For the period from June 2011 to March 2012, they sought\n                            damages for 10 shipments totalling 588,839.60 MT, with a total claim of\n                            USD 7,830,742.02 after a 2% reduction. For the period from April 2012 to\n                            December 2012, they claimed damages for 9 shipments totalling 529,955.64\n                            MT, with a total claim of USD 8,439,543.57 after a 2% reduction. The\n                            combined claim for both periods amounted to USD 16,270,285.59. Seaspray\n                            also sought 10% annual interest on the claimed amount and arbitration-\n                            related costs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">                            24.   Seaspray alleged that SAIL failed to supply the cargo despite multiple\n                            requests and instead entered the spot market for shipments that should have\n                            been delivered under the COA. They provided instances where SAIL\n                            fulfilled third-party contracts instead.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">                            25.   SAIL contended that COA was a service contract and not a valid\n                            agreement, and that the dispute did not fall under maritime arbitration. They\n                            terminated the COA on 11.09.2012, backdating it to April/May 2011 due to\n                            non-supply, citing economic slowdown and force majeure. They argued that\n                            Seaspray could not claim unearned profits without actual loss and that the\n                            COA was obsolete and impractical. SAIL argued that the Seaspray was\n                            merely an arranger of vessels and not entitled to any portion of the freight\n                            payable to the vessel owner. They emphasized that Seaspray was not the\n                            vessel owner under the agreement and had not notified or kept any vessels\n                            idle for the contract. SAIL also cited force majeure as ground for cancelling\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019              Page 8 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">14:19:18</span>\n                             the agreement and argued that the claim was a civil matter and, hence,\n                            outside the scope of maritime arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">                            26.   In their rejoinder, Seaspray refuted SAIL&#x27;s defences, stating that the\n                            contract terms were unambigous. Seaspray countered the SAIL&#x27;s argument\n                            that the vessels provided were not owned by Seaspray, arguing that the\n                            contract explicitly allowed for the vessels to be owned, managed, chartered,\n                            operated, or otherwise controlled by Seaspray. Consequently, ownership of\n                            the vessels was not necessary, and Seaspray had arranged the vessels as per\n                            the contract terms. It was further argued that COA is clear and falls within\n                            the definition of a &#x27;maritime dispute,&#x27; governed by the Maritime Arbitration\n                            Rules of the Indian Council of Arbitration. Seaspray countered the force\n                            majeure defence, noting it was lifted before the SAIL&#x27;s first default and did\n                            not affect the contract&#x27;s performance. Additionally, Seaspray asserted that\n                            Clause 62 of the COA, cited by the SAIL, was irrelevant and could not be\n                            used to justify the breach of contract. Seaspray claimed their loss was the\n                            profit they would have earned if the contract had been performed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">                            27.   Regarding the application of SAIL under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 16</a>, SAIL contended\n                            that the claim was not a maritime dispute and should be handled in a\n                            different forum. SAIL further contended that SAIL was not a signatory to\n                            the COA, which was signed by Transchart and not by SAIL. Seaspray\n                            countered by asserting that the SAIL&#x27;s application should be dismissed\n                            because it was filed after the SAIL had already submitted its statement of\n                            defence. Seaspray further emphasized that the arbitration clause in COA\n                            clearly stated that disputes should be settled under the Maritime Arbitration\n                            Rules, and the current dispute arose from SAIL&#x27;s failure to provide cargo\n                            and compensate Seaspray.

One of the principal controversies before the Arbitral Tribunal was\n                            whether the arbitration between Seaspray and SAIL would be maintainable,\n                            based on SAIL&#x27;s allegation that the COA had not been entered into and\n                            signed by SAIL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                            31.   The primary conclusion reached by the Tribunal was that the SAIL,\n                            having provided 15 cargoes/stems under the COA and made full payment up\n                            to the 15 cargoes to the Seaspray, could not legally disown the COA and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019               Page 11 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">14:19:18</span>\n                             evade the consequences of breaching its terms. Consequently, the Tribunal\n                            observed that SAIL was bound by the terms of the COA, including Clause\n                            60 thereof.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"997909\" id=\"span_67\">32.   The Tribunal observed that SAIL had cited the case of <a href=\"/doc/997909/\" id=\"a_9\">Indowind\n                            Energy Ltd vs. Wescare (India) Ltd and Others</a>, (2010) 5 SCC 306. The\n                            Tribunal held that this case was distinguishable from the case at hand, as the\n                            SAIL was clearly named as a party in the COA and had acknowledged and\n                            performed the COA by accepting 15 shipments.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                            33.   As per the impugned award, the COA explicitly referred to the\n                            agreement between Seaspray Shipping Ltd. and SAIL, and signed by Mr. S.\n                            Chandrasekaran, Chartering Officer, Ministry of Shipping, Govt. of India,\n                            for and on behalf of SAIL. The Addendum No. 1 dated 29.06.2010 had also\n                            been similarly signed. SAIL had not challenged the authority of the\n                            Chartering Officer or the validity of the COA&#x27;s execution. It was further\n                            observed that an email from SAIL dated 08.09.2011 acknowledged the\n                            intention to perform its obligations under COA despite options to\n                            discontinue, and the SAIL had made payments for 15 shipments. The\n                            Tribunal found no merit in the SAIL&#x27;s contention that it was not a party to\n                            the COA or the arbitration agreement and rejected this argument.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">                            34.   SAIL had also argued that the disputes under the COA were not\n                            maritime disputes and that the COA was not a maritime contract. However,\n                            Rule 7 of the Maritime Rules clearly included disputes related to contracts\n                            of affreightment. Therefore, the Tribunal disagreed with the SAIL&#x27;s\n                            argument. The term &quot;contract of affreightment&quot; (COA) referred to long-term\n                            arrangements for the supply of shipping space over multiple voyages. The\n                            Tribunal held that the COA was a &quot;Contract of Affreightment&quot; and a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019               Page 12 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">14:19:18</span>\n                             maritime contract. The disputes arising under this COA were maritime\n                            disputes, and the arbitrators had the jurisdiction to entertain and decide on\n                            these disputes as per Clause 60 of the COA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                            35.   SAIL&#x27;s argument that the COA was not a contract but merely an\n                            agreement was also rejected. The Arbitral Tribunal noted that according to\n                            <a href=\"/doc/1804257/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 2(h)</a> of the ICA, a contract is an enforceable agreement. COA\n                            specified the obligations of both parties and did not leave any essential terms\n                            undecided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"434065\" id=\"span_74\">36.   SAIL cited several judgments, including <a href=\"/doc/434065/\" id=\"a_11\">Union of India vs. Maddala\n                            Thathiah and others</a>, to contend that the COA lacked binding force.\n                            However, these cases were held to be distinguished by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n                            The Arbitral Tribunal observed that COA represented a mutual commitment\n                            by both parties to specific terms, making it a binding contract.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">                            37.   Another issue that the Arbitral Tribunal considered in detail was\n                            whether the hiring of vessels through Seaspray for 2008-2009 was rendered\n                            impossible, excusing the SAIL from all performance. SAIL argued that due\n                            to cheaper ships available in the spot market, the COA had become\n                            &#x27;impossible&#x27; to perform, citing an economic example. However, this\n                            argument was rejected as it contradicted the principle of a binding contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">                            38.   SAIL claimed that a global economic slowdown, a reduction in\n                            Handymax parcels, and a fall in spot freight rates made the COA financially\n                            unviable. They claimed that the contract had become impossible under\n                            <a href=\"/doc/648614/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 56</a> of the Indian Contract Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">                            39.   Seaspray countered that COA was still a binding contract despite\n                            market changes. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the SAIL&#x27;s arguments did\n                            not satisfy the criteria for impossibility of performance, as the changes were\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019                  Page 13 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">14:19:18</span>\n                             not beyond what the parties could have anticipated. The Arbitral Tribunal\n                            also noted that SAIL had continued to perform similar contracts during the\n                            alleged force majeure period and had not formally declared force majeure\n                            under the COA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">                            40.   The Arbitral Tribunal concluded that SAIL was in clear breach of the\n                            COA and awarded damages to Seaspray, including interest and costs, for the\n                            unshipped quantity. Additionally, Seaspray was awarded interest at 6% per\n                            annum from 01.12.2012, and costs of USD 100,000, along with arbitration\n                            costs fixed by the ICA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                            41.   However, the Arbitral Tribunal did not provide any reasoning for the\n                            conclusions drawn in respect to the issues set out in paragraphs 71.5 to 71.7\n                            of the award, which was later pointed out in the petition filed by SAIL\n                            against the Original Award under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a> of the A&amp;C Act. During the\n                            said Proceedings, the learned Single Judge observed, in an order dated\n                            22.02.2017, that the Arbitral Tribunal had not provided reasons for its\n                            conclusions in paragraphs 71.5 to 71.7 of the Award. Consequently, the\n                            Court directed the Arbitral Tribunal to reconvene and furnish reasons for its\n                            conclusions on these specific issues.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                            42.   In compliance with these directions, the Arbitral Tribunal issued an\n                            Additional Award on 10.06.2017, providing the required reasons for the\n                            conclusions in paragraphs 71.5 to 71.7 of the Award dated 20.08.2014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">                            43.   The Arbitral Tribunal held that Clause 62 of the COA should be\n                            interpreted in the context of the Agreement&#x27;s other provisions and applied\n                            only to circumstances constituting frustration of the Agreement, specifically\n                            targeting the coal supplier in Australia rather than SAIL.

The first issue addressed by the court was whether the Arbitral\n                            Tribunal correctly concluded that the COA dated 04.12.2007 was a binding\n                            contract between the parties, rather than a Memorandum of Understanding\n                            or a preliminary Agreement to enter into a future contract. The learned\n                            Single Judge observed that Clause 1 of the Agreement specified the quantity\n                            and parcel size of Coking Coal to be shipped from Queensland, Australia, to\n                            the Eastern Coast of India. Clause 2 outlined the shipment period, which\n                            extended from April 2008 to December 2012, with a possible extension to\n                            March 2013. Clauses 3 and 4 detailed the vessels to be used, Clause 5\n                            provided the procedure for vessel nomination, and Clause 6 specified the\n                            loading and unloading parameters. The Court held that these terms clearly\n                            indicated that the Agreement was intended to be a binding contract, not a\n                            mere Memorandum of Understanding or an agreement to agree in the future.\n                            The Court observed that the Original Award dated 20.08.2014 supported this\n                            conclusion, and there was no reason to interfere with this finding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">                            45.   Regarding the interpretation and effect of Clause 62 of the\n                            Agreement, the Court observed that Clause 61 was the Force Majeure\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019               Page 15 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">14:19:18</span>\n                             Clause, which deferred obligations under the Agreement due to various\n                            extraordinary events. Clause 62, the Default Clause, allowed for the\n                            termination of the Agreement if the Suppliers/Charterers failed to perform\n                            their obligations. The Court observed that Clause 62 of the Agreement\n                            explicitly allows SAIL to terminate the contract for convenience if the\n                            contract fails &quot;in any manner or otherwise.&quot; The Court also dismissed\n                            Seaspray&#x27;s argument that the use of &quot;Suppliers/Charterers&quot; in Clause 62\n                            creates ambiguity, affirming that the term solely refers to the SAIL and does\n                            not affect the clause&#x27;s validity. Thus, the Tribunal&#x27;s interpretation of Clause\n                            62 as only applying to frustration events was held to be unsustainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                            46.   The Court also noted that the SAIL&#x27;s letter dated 11.09.2012 clearly\n                            conveyed its intent to terminate the Agreement under Clause 62. Contrary to\n                            the impugned award&#x27;s observation that the termination lacked a positive\n                            declaration, the Court found that the letter unequivocally indicated the\n                            Agreement&#x27;s termination. The Court held that the termination was valid and\n                            became effective upon its communication to Seaspray on 13.09.2012.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                            47.   However, the Court observed that letter could not terminate the\n                            Agreement retroactively, as Clause 62 does not grant SAIL the authority to\n                            do so. Therefore, the termination was effective only from 13.09.2012. While\n                            upholding the Tribunal&#x27;s observation pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 73</a>, read with\n                            Illustrations (a), (d), and (g) of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Contract Act, 1872</a>, for loss of\n                            expected profit prior to the contract termination, the Court held that SAIL\n                            was liable to pay damages for the period before the termination, i.e., prior to\n                            13.09.2012. The Court stated that since shipments were to be made on an\n                            &quot;evenly spread per month basis,&quot; the amount due to Seaspray should be\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019               Page 16 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">14:19:18</span>\n                             recalculated based on the shipment quantity owed up until the date of the\n                            Contract&#x27;s termination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57887874\" id=\"span_99\">48.   The objection raised by SAIL regarding the rate of interest awarded\n                            on the amount was allowed by the learned Single Judge in view of the\n                            decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/57887874/\" id=\"a_16\">Vedanta Limited v. Shenzhen Shandong\n                            Nuclear Power Construction Co. Ltd. (Supra</a>). The learned Single Judge set\n                            aside the interest awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal and awarded interest at\n                            the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                            SUBMISSIONS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\">                            49.   In challenging the Impugned Order, Seaspray argues that the Hon&#x27;ble\n                            Court substituted the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s interpretation with its own by\n                            asserting that Clause 62 of the COA unambiguously grants SAIL an\n                            unfettered right to terminate the agreement. Seaspray contends that the\n                            Tribunal&#x27;s interpretation of Clause 62 was justified because a literal reading\n                            of the clause would lead to absurd results, such as allowing a &quot;Supplier,&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                            who is not a party to the COA, to terminate the agreement. Seaspray\n                            emphasizes    that   the   Hon&#x27;ble     Court    erred   in   assuming      that\n                            &quot;Suppliers/Charterers&quot; referred solely to SAIL when the COA clearly\n                            distinguishes between the physical suppliers of coal in Australia and SAIL\n                            as Charterers. Seaspray asserts that when a literal interpretation leads to an\n                            absurdity, a purposive construction should be adopted to ensure the\n                            agreement&#x27;s provisions make sense within the entire context.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">                            50.   Seaspray further argues that the Hon&#x27;ble Court failed to appreciate\n                            that the Tribunal&#x27;s construction of Clause 62 was reasonable and provided\n                            coherent meaning to all the words in the clause, including &quot;Supplier.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019               Page 17 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">14:19:18</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                             Seaspray clarifies that the Tribunal did not deny the existence of a\n                            termination for convenience clause but questioned the applicability of\n                            Clause 62 under the specific circumstances of the COA due to its ambiguity.\n                            Seaspray maintains that Clause 62 cannot be considered a clear and\n                            unambiguous clause. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1858757\" id=\"span_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1640953\" id=\"span_107\">In support of the said contention Seaspray has relied\n                            upon the judgements in <a href=\"/doc/1640953/\" id=\"a_17\">Central Bank of India Ltd, Amritsar v.

Therefore, the Hon&#x27;ble Court&#x27;s\n                            interference was unwarranted given the limited scope of review under\n                            <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 34</a> of the A&amp;C Act.

Seaspray points out that the\n                            Tribunal determined that the fax message dated 11.09.2012 was not a valid\n                            declaration but merely an internal communication suggesting that the COA\n                            ended in May 2011.

SAIL on the other hand counters the aforesaid submissions. It\n                            supports the decision of the learned Single Judge that the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s\n                            interpretation of Clause 62 of the COA to the effect that it did not entitle\n                            SAIL to terminate the COA at its discretion and without reason, was\n                            erroneous. However it challenges the learned Single Judge&#x27;s order to the\n                            extent it upholds the award of damages to Seaspray, albeit for the reduced\n                            period. SAIL contends that the learned Single Judge failed to fully consider\n                            Clause 62 of the COA, which provides an option for non-performance and\n                            the declaration of the contract &quot;at end&quot; without any liabilities on either side.\n                            SAIL submits that according to this clause, if either the Suppliers or\n                            Charterers fail to perform their obligations, the contract can be terminated\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019                Page 19 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">14:19:18</span>\n                             without liability. SAIL argues that if the charterer or supplier of the material\n                            fails to provide the material for shipment, the agreement ends without any\n                            liabilities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">                            56.    SAIL claims that the learned Single Judge misinterpreted the clauses\n                            of the agreement, particularly Clause 62, which allows the SAIL to\n                            terminate the agreement without liability if the Suppliers/Charterers fail to\n                            perform its obligation. It is further contended that the learned Single Judge\n                            failed to take into consideration the plain and literal meaning of Clause 62,\n                            which entitles the Suppliers/Charterers to terminate the contract without\n                            liabilities for the unsupplied quantity. It is further submitted that the learned\n                            Single Judge, erred in holding that the SAIL could not terminate the\n                            agreement retrospectively.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158693\" id=\"span_123\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1875748\" id=\"span_124\">57.

SAIL contends that merely stating a claim for\n                            compensation without evidence does not suffice. They cite the Supreme\n                            Court&#x27;s ruling in <a href=\"/doc/1875748/\" id=\"a_25\">State of Rajasthan v.

SAIL further submits that the arbitral tribunal lacked jurisdiction as\n                            the dispute was not maritime in nature. Maritime disputes typically involve\n                            issues like vessel acceptance at load ports, demurrage, or damage during\n                            transit, which were not applicable here.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                            59.

The contract required shipments from April 2008 to\n                            December 2012, with shipments supposed to be evenly spread monthly. The\n                            violation period, during which no shipments occurred, is from May 2011 to\n                            December 2012, and damages were awarded for this period. According to\n                            the Appellant, a retrospective termination would only result in reducing the\n                            damages awarded for the last three months by the Tribunal. It is averred that\n                            both the Arbitral Tribunal and the learned Single Judge correctly concluded\n                            that the termination could not be applied retrospectively, as supported by the\n                            Tribunal&#x27;s detailed reasoning and the learned Single Judge&#x27;s order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">                            60.

This does not require the\n                            non-defaulting party to procure goods or ships but rather to assess damages\n                            based on market conditions.

There can be no cavil as to the scope of interference with an arbitral\n                            award rendered in the context of an international commercial arbitration.

The concept of patent illegality applies exclusively to\n                            domestic awards, and as such, is not relevant in this case.

Further, it was noticed by the Division Bench that &quot;the Arbitral\n                            Tribunal&#x27;s construction of Clause 62 of the COA was largely founded on the\n                            contextual interpretation of the said Clause&quot;. It was further held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                                   &quot;82. This is apparent from the further detailed reasoning provided by the\n                                   Arbitral Tribunal. The Arbitral Tribunal accepted that in construing a\n                                   clause of a contract, the words and expressed terms are required to be\n                                   given their plain meaning unless the same lead to any absurdity or\n                                   results in making the said clause otiose. The Arbitral Tribunal proceeded\n                                   to consider SAIL&#x27;s contention that Clause 62 of the COA was required to\n                                   be read literally as well as the decision in the case of Rajasthan State\n                                   Industrial Development and Investment Corporation &amp;Anr. v. Diamond\n                                   &amp; Gem Development Corporation Ltd. &amp; Anr.12 which was relied upon\n                                   by SAIL in support of its contention. The Arbitral Tribunal rejected the\n                                   contention that the said decision supported SAIL&#x27;s contention. The\n                                   Arbitral Tribunal held that the expression &quot;Suppliers/Charterers in any\n                                   manner or otherwise fail to perform the contract&quot; in Clause 62 of the\n                                   COA would have to be read in the context of the other words contained\n                                   in Clause 62 of the COA. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the said\n                                   expression enabled SAIL to terminate the COA only when it was helpless\n                                   in performing the same and not at its will or for commercial reasons. The\n                                   Arbitral Tribunal did not accept that SAIL would be entitled to terminate\n                                   the contract as it had become commercially unprofitable to perform the\n                                   same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                                   83. The Arbitral Tribunal accepted Noble&#x27;s contention that the said\n                                   clause must be given a purposive interpretation to give effect to the joint\n                                   intent of the parties. The Arbitral Tribunal supported the said view by\n                                   interpreting Clauses 61 and 62 of the COA as exceptions, which release\n                                   the parties from their obligations to be performed under the COA.\n                                   Plainly, such exceptions could not entail an absolute unfettered\n                                   discretion to terminate the COA at will.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                                   84. The Arbitral Tribunal also reasoned that if the intent of the parties\n                                   was to give SAIL an unguided power to terminate the COA, the clause\n                                   would have simply read so. The Arbitral Tribunal also found that the\n                                   literal reading of the expression &quot;suppliers/charterers in any manner or\n                                   otherwise fail to perform the contract&quot; would render it inconsistent with\n                                   the first part and the last part of the same Clause.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"180317\" id=\"span_183\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"291263\" id=\"span_184\">85. The Arbitral Tribunal held that in such circumstances, the\n                                   construction of the expression, which is different from its literal meaning,\n                                   must be accepted. The Arbitral Tribunal also referred to the decisions of\n                                   the Privy Council in <a href=\"/doc/291263/\" id=\"a_60\">Raneegunge Coal Association Ltd. v.

In addition,\n                                   the Arbitral Tribunal held that accepting SAIL&#x27;s interpretation would\n                                   render Clause 61 of the COA redundant. It observed that if one\n                                   interpretation would render Clause 61 of the COA as redundant and two\n                                   constructions are possible, the one which would give effect to the other\n                                   provisions of the contract, must be accepted. The aforesaid reasoning of\n                                   the Arbitral Tribunal informed its decision that SAIL&#x27;s termination of the\n                                   COA was invalid.</span></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                                                                      ****\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                                   87. Whilst the Arbitral Tribunal made observations to the said effect by\n                                   construing Clause 62 of the COA in the manner as canvassed by SAIL\n                                   would render it vulnerable on the ground of public policy, the Arbitral\n                                   Tribunal&#x27;s interpretation of Clause 62 of the COA is not founded on that\n                                   reason alone. The Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s decision is founded on its finding\n                                   that Clause 62 of the COA was required to be construed in accordance\n                                   with the nature of the contract (COA) and SAIL&#x27;s interpretation of the\n                                   said clause would render it inherently conflicting.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">                                   88.

It is settled law that the deed has\n                                   to be construed as a whole. The intent of the parties is to be ascertained\n                                   by the language of the written contract read as a whole and not by\n                                   reading parts of the clauses of the contract literally dehors their context.\n                                   The Arbitral Tribunal undertook precisely the same exercise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                                   89. It is well settled that interpretation of a contract falls within the\n                                   jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, thus, it is the final adjudicator of the\n                                   said construction and its decision cannot be interfered unless it is found\n                                   that the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s view is not a possible one.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"64618485\" id=\"span_191\">72.

A plain reading of the above clearly indicates that the scope of\n                                    setting aside an arbitral award on the ground that it falls foul of public\n                                    policy of India is extremely narrow. The grounds that an arbitral award\n                                    is perverse or irrational does not necessarily qualify as a ground to set\n                                    aside an arbitral award on the ground that it is in conflict with the public\n                                    policy of India. Thus, even if we accept (which we do not) that the\n                                    Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s interpretation of the COA is erroneous, the impugned\n                                    award could not be set aside on the ground of being in conflict with the\n                                    public policy of India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">Digitally Signed By:ROHIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                            FAO(OS) (COMM) 109/2019 &amp; FAO(OS) (COMM) 144/2019                         Page 31 of 37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">KUMAR PATEL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">Signing Date:15.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">14:19:18</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"64618485\" id=\"span_211\">75.

In terms thereof, the interpretation\n                            accorded to the said Clause is perfectly within the domain of the Arbitral\n                            Tribunal and cannot be interfered with in exercise of the jurisdiction under\n                            <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 34</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1821948/\" id=\"a_74\">37</a> of the A&amp;C Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">                            76.

It is also noticed that the impugned award in the present case has also\n                            rendered a factual finding to the effect that SAIL did not, in unequivocal\n                            terms, made the requisite declaration as required under Clause 62 and cited\n                            several instances which were in the nature of &quot;positive affirmations of the\n                            fact that the respondent had all along treated the Agreement as valid and\n                            subsisting and was aware that it was bound by the obligation to provide the\n                            required cargo. We therefore do not accept the respondent&#x27;s argument that\n                            it validly terminated the Agreement much less that it was done\n                            retrospectively with effect from May 2011&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">                            78.

The Agreement, in\n                                   Clause 1 thereof provides for the parcel size and further Clause 2 states\n                                   the shipment to be on &quot;evenly spread per month basis&quot;. The petitioner\n                                   was in default since June, 2011 and therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal has\n                                   adopted the average of the Baltic Exchange fixture for arriving at the\n                                   damages. No fault can be found in this approach. In any case, this Court\n                                   cannot interfere with an Award merely because it would find some other\n                                   measure of such damages to be more just or reasonable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                                   62. I cannot also agree with the submissions of the learned senior\n                                   counsel for the petitioner that damages could only have been awarded on\n                                   basis of a long term agreement. The petitioner was in breach of COA for\n                                   each of prior failure to declare laycan in terms of the COA on basis of\n                                   &quot;evenly spread per month basis.&quot; The respondent could not have entered\n                                   into a long term agreement for each of such failure/breach. In any case,\n                                   Clause 1(d) provides for calculation of damages based on spot rates in\n                                   case of default by the respondent.

Thus, it does appear that a higher\n                                    rate of interest would be applicable depending on whether he awarded\n                                    amount was paid within the specified period of 120 days or not. In the\n                                    present case, the Arbitral Tribunal has awarded interest at the rate of 3%\n                                    per annum from the date of the Letter of Termination (termination e-mail\n                                    dated 02.01.2023) till the date of the impugned award. The Arbitral\n                                    Tribunal has also awarded interest for the post award period at the rate\n                                    of 9% per annum, which would commence after three months from the\n                                    date of the award. The pre-award interest is a part of the awarded\n                                    amount and covered under Clause (a) of Sub-section (7) of <a href=\"/doc/463976/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 31</a> of\n                                    the A&amp;C Act while future interest at the rate of 9% is covered under\n                                    Clause (b) of Sub-section (7) of <a href=\"/doc/463976/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 31</a> of the A&amp;C Act.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                                    107.

The decision to modify the interest\n                                    awarded cannot be sustained for yet another reason: it is impermissible\n                                    to modify an arbitral award in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 34</a> of the A&amp;C\n                                    Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"57887874\" id=\"span_228\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"87077698\" id=\"span_229\">108.
