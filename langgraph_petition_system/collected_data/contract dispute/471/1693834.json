The respondent-Power Grid Corporation is a Limited\n\nCompany and an enterprise of the Government of India.

Being qualified, the petitioner also participated in the\n\ntender and submitted its documentation on 24.8.2007. The petitioner\n\nalso deposited a bank guarantee of Rs. 96,97,000/- with the respondent\n\nbefore submitting its documents, which was a pre-condition for\n\nparticipation in the tender process as per sub-clause 14.7 of Section II\n\nITB conditions of Contract Vol. 1 (P-3). The petitioner made a bid for\n\nsupply and erection of Reactors-400KV Purena &amp; 400KV Siliguri\n\nSubstations associated with Eastern region strengthening Scheme-II and\n\n400KV Sonepat Substation. In all there is a requirement of 5 Reactors\n\nwhich are identical.   Out of total 5 identical Reactors, 2 are to be\n\ninstalled at Purnea, 2 at Siliguri and 1 at Sonepat substation.      The\n\npetitioner submitted the total price for a single reactor in Schedule-1,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> C.W.P.

The detailed price breakdown of the reactors was given in\n\nSchedule-3(III). These schedules formed a part of the bid documents.\n\nThe price quoted was uniform at Rs. 4,63,14,400/- for one reactor. At\n\nthe end of Schedule-3(III) the petitioner had given the total work price\n\nfor all the five Reactors for three sub-stations at the cost of Rs.\n\n26,06,32,000/-. It was also clearly stated that the total excise duty would\n\nbe Rs. 4,29,52,153-60 and sale tax would be 91,07,524-61. The total\n\nprice, submitted by the petitioner, for all the five reactors inclusive of\n\ntax and octroi was Rs. 32,91,53,838/-. The detailed breakup of price\n\nrequired was to be given in Schedule 3(III), which contained columns\n\nfor Units, Quantity, Unit Ex-Works price, Total Ex-Works price which\n\nwas a sub-total of the Quantity and Unit Ex-Works price, Excise Duty,\n\nSales Tax, Octroi, Entry Tax, others etc. The schedule was in the nature\n\nof a spread sheet with all the figures mentioned in each column.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">5.           It has been pleaded that while printing Schedule 3(III) the\n\nprice in column 7 has been correctly mentioned. The price of two\n\nReactors to be installed at Purnea is also correctly quoted to be Rs.\n\n92,628.800.00. However, on page two starting from Serial No. 1.7 to\n\n2.5, there was a patent printing error in column 7, which apparently got\n\nsqueezed in such a manner that the unit Ex-works price was reduced in\n\nwidth.   As a result of this printing error, the figures shown were\n\nerroneous which resulted in omission of first two digits. In other words,\n\ntwo starting digits for prescribing price were not printed and instead of\n\n10 digits (46314400.00) only 8 were actually printed. The price printed\n\nfor each Reactor is Rs. 314400.00. In this manner, correct figures were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> C.W.P.

For remaining three pages of Schedule 3(III) the figures\n\nwere correctly printed. It has further been emphasized that column 8\n\nhas reflected the correct figures, which gave the sub-total of both\n\nquantity and unit price. For example, for two Reactors the total amount\n\nshown is Rs. 92,628,800.00 although the price of single unit mentioned\n\nby misprint in column 7 was Rs. &#x27;,314,400.00&#x27;. All the figures from\n\ncolumn 1 to 23 were correct except for column 7 on page 2 (P-4 at page\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">235).   Alongwith the documents, the petitioner also submitted a\n\n&#x27;Summary Price Proposal&#x27; with regard to the supply and erection of\n\nequipment at all the above mentioned places, which indicated that the\n\nprice for the goods and remaining services would be Rs. 27,69,17,000/-\n\n(Rupees Twenty Seven Crores Sixty Nine Lacs Seventeen thousand\n\nonly). The petitioner also mentioned the Excise duty @ 16.48% and\n\nSales Tax @ 3% against Form-C as Rs. 4,31,29,314/- and Rs.\n\n91,07,525/- respectively in Schedule 1 clause 2.0. In clause 3.0 the total\n\nlumpsum price inclusive of taxes and duties was mentioned as Rs.\n\n32,91,53,838/- (P-5).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6.          On 24.8.2007 itself, the bid was opened in the presence of\n\nall the representatives of various Companies including the petitioner and\n\nthe petitioner&#x27;s bid was found to be lowest at Rs. 27,69,17,000/- as\n\ncompared to the next to lowest bids of Rs. 40,46,05,600/- given by\n\nBHEL and Rs. 41,65,70,000/- given by Crompton Grieaves Ltd. (P-6).\n\nAt the time of evaluation of the bids given by various bidders, by the\n\nrespondent, the petitioner realized the patent error in printing of\n\nSchedule 3(III).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> C.W.P.

On 20.3.2008, the petitioner addressed a letter to the\n\nrespondent bringing to its notice the above mentioned printing mistake\n\nin respect of unit prices in column 7 at page 2 (P-4) and it was requested\n\nto evaluate their bid at the total evaluated price mentioned in the bid\n\nprice (P-7). The problem started when respondent in reply, vide their\n\nletter dated 24.3.2008, took the stand that the offer given by the\n\npetitioner was evaluated in line with the provisions of the bidding\n\ndocuments.    It has further been pointed out that the petitioner had\n\nsubmitted their bid with &#x27;NIL&#x27; deviation to the specifications and\n\nconfirmed that the work under the subject package would be executed\n\nby it strictly in accordance with the provisions made in the bidding\n\ndocuments. After consideration, the respondent asked the petitioner to\n\ncome forward for post bid discussions vide letter dated 12.3.2008 for\n\nfinalization of Technical, Commercial, Quality and Inspection and\n\nMonitoring aspects, if any. Since the bid validity was to expire on\n\n31.3.2008, the respondent asked the petitioner to extend the bid validity\n\nupto 30.4.2008 (P-8). It is claimed that prior to receipt of letter dated\n\n24.3.2008, the petitioner received a letter dated 25.3.2008 from the\n\nrespondent awarding it the contract for Ex-works supply of equipment\n\nand material for all the three projects, which was followed by another\n\nLetter of Award dated 25.3.2008 (P-9 &amp; P-10 respectively). In the\n\nLetter of Award the respondent had awarded the contract to the\n\npetitioner for Rs. 15 crores approximately, whereas the figure given by\n\nthe petitioner in Schedule-1 was Rs. 32 crores approximately.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">8.

The respondent was requested\n\nto correct the price in terms of the bid price and as mentioned in the\n\nletter dated 20.3.2008, sent to the respondent (P-11). On 11.4.2008, the\n\nrespondent asked the petitioner to execute the contract by 23.4.2008, in\n\nterms of letter of award dated 25.3.2008 (P-10).         With regard to\n\ncorrection in the price it was intimated that the request was against the\n\nbidding documents (P-12). Thus, the petitioner has been required to\n\nsupply five reactors at the cost of Rs. 15,94,27,000/- whereas the offer\n\nmade by the petitioner was for Rs. 32,91,53,838/-. The petitioner was\n\nalso required to furnish an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee\n\namounting to Rs. 1,59,42,700/- within 30 days i.e. by 24.4.2008. In the\n\nevent of failure in signing and executing the contract, the petitioner was\n\nto lose an amount of Rs. 96,97,000/- under the bank guarantee, dated\n\n7.8.2007. In these circumstances, the petitioner has approached this\n\nCourt by filing the instant petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9.           When the matter came up for first hearing on 25.4.2008,\n\nthis Court issued the rule for 29.4.2008 and directed dasti service.

In\n\n             that regard, he has placed reliance on tender document\n\n             Clause 12.2(c) (Annexure P-2) and also Clause 18(1 and 2)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> C.W.P.

It has also been asserted\n\nthat since the company office of the petitioner is situated in the State of\n\nUttar Pradesh and registered office of the respondent is situated in Delhi\n\nand, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction to hear this case. The\n\nsecond objection raised by the respondent is that the present controversy\n\nrelates to a contract, which is not a statutory contract rather it is a\n\ncommercial contract. Clause 12 of the General Conditions of Contract\n\n(GCC) has been relied upon, which prescribes resolution of disputes\n\nthrough arbitration in accordance with Indian laws.\n\nFew Preliminary Objections\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">11.          Mr. A.T.M. Rangaramanujam, learned senior counsel for\n\nthe respondent has raised the preliminary objection that this Court lacks\n\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain such a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of\n\nthe Constitution as the head office of the respondent Corporation is at\n\nDelhi and as per clause 12.1(c) of the SCC (at page 110 of the paper\n\nbook), the Courts at Delhi alone have been given exclusive jurisdiction\n\nin respect of all matters arising out of the contract including execution\n\nof arbitration award. According to the learned counsel once there is\n\nexclusion of jurisdiction of this Court by agreement of the parties then\n\nthe Courts at Delhi alone would have jurisdiction to entertain such a\n\npetition.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"997135\" id=\"span_9\">In support of his submission, learned counsel has placed\n\nreliance on a judgment of Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/997135/\" id=\"a_4\">A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. v. A.P. Agencies, Salem</a>, AIR 1989 SC\n\n1239. He has emphasised that once expression &#x27;alone&#x27; or &#x27;only&#x27; has\n\nbeen used in the exclusion clause then there is no difficulty in restricting\n\nthe jurisdiction for entertaining a litigation at that place alone.

He has further submitted\n\nthat there is arbitration provided by clause 32 of the GCC (at page 84 of\n\nthe paper book), which in terms attract the application of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_6\">Indian\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">12.          Mr. Rangaramanujam has then argued that disputed\n\nquestion of facts are likely to arise and in writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_7\">Article\n\n226</a> of the Constitution such a petition may not be entertained.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">13.          Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned senior counsel for the\n\npetitioner has controverted the aforementioned preliminary objections\n\nraised by the learned counsel for the respondent.           He has firstly\n\nsubmitted that the whole cause of action has arisen within the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court and in any case no part of the cause of action\n\nhas arisen within the jurisdiction of the Delhi Courts. Learned counsel\n\nhas maintained that the parties by their agreement may exclude the\n\njurisdiction of one of those Courts if more than one Courts enjoy\n\njurisdiction over a matter but the parties by their consent cannot confer\n\njurisdiction on a Court which has got none. According to the learned\n\ncounsel no cause of action or any part thereof has arisen within the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of the Courts at Delhi and, therefore, the\n\npreliminary objection raised is liable to be rejected.

On the basis of the aforementioned overwhelming facts on\n\nrecord, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that every part\n\nof cause of action has arisen at Gurgaon and no part of cause of action\n\nhas arisen at Delhi. Therefore, despite the clause conferring exclusive\n\njurisdiction on the courts at Delhi, no jurisdiction could be deemed to\n\nhave been conferred. Learned counsel has submitted that in any case the\n\nclause excluding the jurisdiction i.e. clause 12.1 would come into\n\noperation only when a contract is formed and in the present case only\n\nletter of award has been issued and contract is yet to come into being.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1695101\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1826064\" id=\"span_13\">In support of his submission learned counsel has placed reliance on the\n\njudgments of Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court in the cases of Hakam Singh\n\nv.

Mr. Hansaria has also controverted the submission of the\n\nlearned counsel for the respondent to the effect that disputed question of\n\nfacts are likely to arise in the present petition. According to the learned\n\ncounsel once it is ascertained and determined that the matter revolves\n\naround patent printing error then no disputed question of fact would\n\narise for determination of this Court.

Before deciding the controversy on merit it would be\n\nnecessary to first decide the preliminary objections. Having examined\n\nthe rival contentions and having perused the record we are of the firm\n\nview that none of the preliminary objections are sustainable. This Court\n\nhas exclusive jurisdiction to entertain the instant petition for various\n\nreasons. First and foremost is that the cause of action or every part of it\n\nhas arisen at Gurgaon, which is evident from various documents. The\n\nadvertisement, dated 18.6.2007 (P-1) floating global tender specifically\n\nmentioned that all correspondence/communication including sale of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> C.W.P.

On 2.7.2007, bidding documents were\n\nsupplied by the respondent to the petitioner by accepting payment of\n\ndemand draft payable at Gurgaon, as per the provisions made in clause\n\n3.1 of the GIFB. As per clause 3.4, pre-bid conference was held at\n\nGurgaon on 13.7.2007. It has been specifically provided by clause 5 of\n\nthe GIFB that all correspondence be made to the respondent&#x27;s Corporate\n\nOffice at Gurgaon and even clarification, if any, was to be obtained from\n\nits office at Gurgaon. According to clause 17.2 of the Instructions to\n\nBidders, inner and outer envelopes were to have the Corporation&#x27;s\n\naddress as &#x27;Manager (CS-ER), Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd.,\n\n&quot;Saudamini&quot;, Plot No. 2, Sector 29, Gurgaon, Haryana-122001&#x27;. It is\n\nalso matter of record that the petitioner had submitted its bid on\n\n24.8.2007 (P-4) at the Corporation Office of the respondent at Gurgaon\n\nfor a total consideration of Rs. 27,69,17,000/- (excluding taxes). The\n\nbid submitted by the petitioner alongwith two other bidders were opened\n\nat the respondent&#x27;s Corporation Office at Gurgaon. Even a letter dated\n\n20.3.2008 (P-7), for correction was addressed to the respondent&#x27;s\n\nCorporation Office at Gurgaon. Thereafter, reply to the aforementioned\n\nletter was sent by the respondent on 24.3.2008 (P-8) from its\n\nCorporation Office situated at Gurgaon. On 25.3.2008, letter of award\n\nfor total ex-works price of Rs. 15,83,52,000/-, which has resulted into\n\ndispute, was issued from Gurgaon.        Thereafter on 11.4.2008, the\n\nrespondent wrote a letter to the petitioner from its Corporate Office at\n\nGurgaon inviting them to execute the contract as per the letter of award,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> C.W.P. No. 6820 of 2008                                                14</span>\n\n\nsign a duplicate copy of the letter of award and contract performance\n\nguarantee (P-12).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">18.          The aforementioned factual position overwhelmingly\n\nshows that no part of cause of action has arisen at a place other than\n\nGurgaon, which is situated in the State of Haryana and is within the\n\nterritorial jurisdiction of this Court. No cause of action or a part thereof\n\nhas arisen in Delhi. It is now well settled, as has been rightly contended\n\nby Mr. Hansaria, that parties by their consent cannot confer territorial\n\njurisdiction on a Court where no cause of action has arisen. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1695101\" id=\"span_17\">In that\n\nregard reliance has been rightly placed on the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1695101/\" id=\"a_10\">Patel Roadways Ltd.</a> (supra). In that\n\ncase, a private transport company had raised a similar objection, which\n\nwas rejected by the Supreme Court with the observation that the\n\nCompany may have head office and branch offices. For the purposes of\n\ncause of action, a suiter cannot be compelled to file a suit at the head\n\noffice if no cause of action or part of cause of action has arisen within\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction of the courts at head office.     Rejecting a\n\nsimilar argument their Lordships&#x27; proceeded to interpret Explanation-I\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 20</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for brevity, &#x27;the\n\nCode&#x27;), which reads thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;9.    ...... What has been urged with the aid of the\n\n             Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1673226/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 20</a> of the Code is that since the\n\n             appellant has its principal office in Bombay it shall be\n\n             deemed to carry on business at Bombay and consequently\n\n             the courts at Bombay will also have jurisdiction. On a plain\n\n             reading of the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1673226/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 20</a> of the Code we\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> C.W.P.

The\n\n           Explanation is in two parts, one before the word &quot;or&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1695101\" id=\"span_19\">occurring between the words &quot;office in India&quot; and the\n\n           words &quot;in respect of&quot; and the other thereafter. The\n\n           Explanation applies to a defendant which is a corporation\n\n           which term, as seen above, would include even a company\n\n           such as the appellant in the instant case. The first part of the\n\n           Explanation applies only to such a corporation which has\n\n           its sole or principal office at a particular place. In that event\n\n           the courts within whose jurisdiction the sole or principal\n\n           office of the defendant is situate will also have jurisdiction\n\n           inasmuch as even if the defendant may not be actually\n\n           carrying on business at that place, it will &quot;be deemed to\n\n           carry on business&quot; at that place because of the fiction\n\n           created by the Explanation. The latter part of the\n\n           Explanation takes care of a case where the defendant does\n\n           not have a sole office but has a principal office at one place\n\n           and has also a subordinate office at another place. The\n\n           words &quot;at such place&quot; occurring at the end of the\n\n           Explanation and the word &quot;or<a href=\"/doc/1695101/\" id=\"a_14\">&quot; <a href=\"/doc/1695101/\" id=\"a_15\">referred to above</a></a> which is\n\n           disjunctive clearly suggest that if the case falls within the\n\n           latter part of the Explanation, it is not the Court within\n\n           whose jurisdiction the principal office of the defendant is\n\n           situate but the Court within whose jurisdiction it has a\n\n           subordinate office which alone shall have jurisdiction &quot;in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> C.W.P.

Referring to its earlier judgments in the case of Hakam\n\nSingh (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/1826064/\" id=\"a_16\">Globe Transport Corporation</a> (supra), their\n\nLordships&#x27; proceeded to hold that the expression &#x27;corporation&#x27; used in\n\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/1673226/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 20</a> of the Code would also include a private\n\nlimited company like the respondent. It has been further held that it is\n\nnot open to the parties by agreement to confer jurisdiction on any Court\n\nunless such a Court possesses jurisdiction on account of cause of action\n\nor any part thereof having arisen there. In that regard, the views of their\n\nLordships&#x27; are discernible from paras 12 and 13, which reads thus:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             &quot;12. We would also like to add that the interpretation\n\n             sought to be placed by the appellant on the provision in\n\n             question renders the explanation totally redundant. If the\n\n             intention of the legislature was, as is said on their behalf,\n\n             that a suit against a corporation could be instituted either at\n\n             the place of its sole or principal office (whether or not the\n\n             corporation carries on business at that place) or at any other\n\n             place where the cause of action arises, the provisions of\n\n             clauses (a), (b) and (c) together with the first part of the\n\n             Explanation would have completely achieved the purpose.\n\n             Indeed the effect would have been wider. The suit could\n\n             have been instituted at the place of the principal office\n\n             because of the situation of such office (whether or not any\n\n             actual business was carried on there). Alternatively, a suit\n\n             could have been instituted at the place where the cause of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> C.W.P. No. 6820 of 2008                                               17</span>\n\n\n           action arose under clause (c) (irrespective of whether the\n\n           corporation had a subordinate office in such place or not).\n\n           This was, therefore, not the purpose of the Explanation.\n\n           The Explanation is really an explanation to clause (a). It is\n\n           in the nature of a clarification on the scope of clause (a)\n\n           viz. as to where the corporation can be said to carry on\n\n           business. This, it is clarified, will be the place where the\n\n           principal office is situated (whether or not any business\n\n           actually is carried on there) or the place where a business is\n\n           carried on giving rise to a cause of action (even though the\n\n           principal office of the corporation is not located there) so\n\n           long as there is a subordinate office of the corporation\n\n           situated at such place. &#x27;The linking together of the place\n\n           where the cause of action arises with the place where a\n\n           subordinate office is located clearly shows that the\n\n           intention of the legislature was that, in the case of a\n\n           corporation, for the purposes of clause (a), the location of\n\n           the subordinate office, within the local limits of which a\n\n           cause of action arises, is to be the relevant place for the\n\n           filing of a suit and not the principal place of business. If the\n\n           intention was that the location of the sole or principal office\n\n           as well as the location of the subordinate office (within the\n\n           limits of which a cause of action arises) are to be deemed to\n\n           be placed where the corporation is deemed to be carrying\n\n           on business, the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; will not be there. Instead,\n\n           the second part of the Explanation would have read &quot;and, in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> C.W.P.

As far as we can see the interpretation which we\n\n           have placed on this section does not create any practical or\n\n           undue difficulties or disadvantage either to the plaintiff or a\n\n           defendant corporation. It is true that, normally, under\n\n           clauses (a) to (c), the plaintiff has a choice of forum and\n\n           cannot be compelled to go to the place of residence or\n\n           business of the corporation and can file a suit at a place\n\n           where the cause of action arises. If a corporation desires to\n\n           be protected from being dragged into litigation at some\n\n           place merely because a cause of action arises there it can\n\n           save itself from such a situation by an exclusion clause as\n\n           has been done in the present case. The clear intendment of\n\n           the Explanation, however, is that, where the corporation\n\n           has a subordinate office in the place where the cause of\n\n           action arises, it cannot be heard to say that it cannot be sued\n\n           there because it does not carry on business at that place. It\n\n           would be a great hardship if, in spite of the corporation\n\n           having a subordinate office at the place where the cause of\n\n           action arises (with which in all probability the plaintiff has\n\n           had dealings), such plaintiff is to be compelled to travel to\n\n           the place where the corporation has its principal place. That\n\n           place should be convenient to the plaintiff, and since the\n\n           corporation has an office at such place, it will also be under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\"> C.W.P. No. 6820 of 2008                                                  19</span>\n\n\n             no disadvantage. Thus the Explanation provides an\n\n             alternative locus for the corporation&#x27;s place of business, not\n\n             an additional one.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1069885\" id=\"span_25\">20.

United India\n\nInsurance Company Ltd.</a>, (2004) 4 SCC 677. It is, thus, evident that\n\nthe expression &#x27;cause of action&#x27; is inexorably associated with the place\n\nwhere a fact or a bunch of fact is borne. It is trite to observe that there is\n\nno statutory definition of this expression but it has been judicially\n\ninterpreted. It implies a right to sue and, inter alia, means that every fact\n\nwhich would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove, if, traversed, in\n\norder to support his right to the judgment of the Court. It is also well\n\nsettled that the entire bundle of facts pleaded do not need to constitute a\n\ncause of action because in order to obtain a decree, the plaintiff is\n\nrequired to prove only material facts which are also known as integral\n\nfacts. The question as to whether a Court has a territorial jurisdiction to\n\nentertain a writ petition must be resolved on the basis of integral facts\n\npleaded in support of cause of action so as to empower the Court to\n\ndecide the dispute. As long as the whole cause of action or part of it has\n\narisen in the territorial limits of a Court, it would not have jurisdiction to\n\ntry such a cause of action.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"93127\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1876565\" id=\"span_27\">In that regard reliance may be placed on the\n\njudgment of Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1876565/\" id=\"a_19\">Kusum Ingots\n\nand Alloys Ltd. v.

In the present case, it is not disputed that the respondent\n\nhas addressed a letter dated 11.4.2008 to the petitioner requesting them\n\nto execute the contract as per letter of award and furnish signed and\n\nstamped duplicate copy of the letter of award alongwith the specific\n\ncontract performance guarantee. It is, thus, evident that the contract is\n\nyet to be formed and clause 12.1(c) would not come into operation. The\n\ncontrary argument of learned counsel for the respondent based on clause\n\n31.2 of the Instruction to the Bidders that the letter of award or\n\nnotification of award was to constitute the formation of contract does\n\nnot have any leg to stand because the issuance of letter of award, dated\n\n25.3.2008 has not yet been translated into a contract as according to\n\nclauses 32.1 and 32.2 the successful bidder is required to sign and date\n\nthe contract within 30 days of the receipt of the contract form as\n\nenvisaged by clause 32.1.       The clauses 31 and 32 are reproduced\n\nhereunder, which reads thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            &quot;31.0 Notification of Award\n\n            31.1 Prior to the expiration of the period of bid validity,\n\n                   the Purchaser/Owner will notify the successful\n\n                   Bidder in writing in the form of Notification of\n\n                   Award (NOA)/Letter of Award (LOA), that its Bid\n\n                   has been accepted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            31.2 The Notification of Award/Letter of Award will\n\n                   constitute the formation of the Contract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">            31.3 The Purchaser/Owner will promptly discharge the\n\n                   bid security of unsuccessful Bidder pursuant to\n\n                   Clause 14.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> C.W.P.

A perusal of the aforementioned section shows that it does\n\nnot deal with territorial jurisdiction or the question concerning cause of\n\naction.

He points out that in respect of identical Item No. 2 i.e.\n\n125 MVAR Shunt Reactor Package for 400KV Siliguri Sub Station, the\n\nprice of two units has been mentioned as Rs. 92,628,800.00 in column\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">8. However, printing error has crept in, in column 7 where the first two\n\ndigits &#x27;46&#x27; have been omitted and the price mentioned is Rs. 314,400.00.\n\nHe has emphasised that there is no such error with regard to Item No. 3\n\non the third page in respect of the same item i.e. 125 MVAR Shunt\n\nReactor Package for 400KV Sonepat Sub Station associated with NRSS-\n\nXII Project. The price mentioned at Item No. 3.1 is the same i.e. Rs.\n\n46,314,400.00. According to the learned counsel even in the Summary\n\nPrice Proposal submitted by the petitioner all prices have been clarified\n\nand the total lumpsum price quoted is Rs. 32,91,53,838.00 (Rupees\n\nthirty two crores ninety one lacs fifty three thousand eight hundred and\n\nthirty eight only). He has then referred to the comparative statement of\n\nrates quoted by the petitioner, BHEL and CGL. The total bid price\n\nquoted by the petitioner is Rs. 27,69,17,000/- plus excise duty, Central\n\nSales Tax and other levies, whereas the BHEL has quoted for the same\n\nitem Rs. 40,46,05,600/- and the CGL has quoted Rs. 41,65,70,000/-.\n\nTherefore, he has emphasised that only because of printing error the\n\nrespondent has acted unreasonably by insisting that the same item for\n\nwhich price for 400KV Purnea Extension Sub Station and 400KV\n\nSonepat Sub Station is Rs. 4,63,14,400/- and in respect of 400KV\n\nSiliguri it should be supplied @ Rs. 3,14,400/-, whereas the total of two\n\nunits still shows the actual and correct price, namely, Rs. 9,26,28,800/-.\n\nTherefore, learned counsel has prayed for issuance of direction as per\n\nthe prayer made in the petition.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\"> C.W.P.

He has placed reliance\n\non clause 23 of the Instructions to Bidders to argue that only\n\narithmetical errors could be rectified and correction in bid price has to\n\nbe resolved by taking the unit price as against the total price, as the\n\ncorrect price because clause 23 stipulates that unit price is to prevail.\n\nHe has drawn our attention to other clauses of ITB like clause 4, which\n\nobliges the bidder to examine all instructions, forms, terms and\n\nspecifications in the Bidding Documents and any failure to furnish the\n\ninformation is at the bidder&#x27;s risk.     He has further submitted that\n\naccording to clause 6 of the ITB, amendment of bidding documents\n\ncould have been made after submitting the documents on 7.8.2007 but\n\nbefore opening of the bid. The tenders were opened on 24.8.2007 and\n\ntill that time no request for correction was made. However, after more\n\nthan 6-7 months, request for correction was received pointing out\n\nprinting errors, which was too late. Learned counsel has highlighted\n\nthat the petitioner, at its quoted price, has been invited for signing of\n\ncontract and it is now resiling by putting forward the excuse of printing\n\nerror. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"55804\" id=\"span_41\">In support of his submission, learned counsel has placed reliance\n\non a judgment of Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/55804/\" id=\"a_31\">West\n\nBengal Electricity Board v. Patel Engineering Co. Ltd.</a>, AIR 2001\n\nSC 682. Placing reliance on paras 22 to 25, learned counsel has argued\n\nthat computer typographical error had occurred <a href=\"/doc/55804/\" id=\"a_32\">in that case</a> and the\n\ncontention of the bidder for correction was rejected.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\"> C.W.P.

Another submission made by Mr. Rangaramanujam is that\n\nall tender documents were submitted by one Shri Gopal Krishan Gupta,\n\nwho is Director of the Power Transformer in the petitioner company (P-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">4) and even Summary Price Proposal has been duly signed by the\n\naforementioned Shri Gopal Krishan Gupta. According to the learned\n\ncounsel an affidavit by Shri Gopal Krishan Gupta was required to be\n\nfiled verifying the fact that printing error by omitting the digit of &#x27;46&#x27;\n\nhas occurred while quoting price on the second page of column 7 of\n\nSchedule 3(III). Learned counsel has pointed out that affidavit of one\n\nShri Gauri Shankar Mishra son of Shri Ashutosh Mishra of New Delhi\n\nhas been filed, who is not supposed to know the filing of tender, quoting\n\nof price or omission of two digits &#x27;46&#x27; in respect of supply of two\n\nReactors at 400KV Siliguri Sub Station.              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"723210\" id=\"span_43\">In support of the\n\naforementioned submission, learned counsel has placed reliance on a\n\nDivision Bench judgment of Delhi High Court in the case of M/s <a href=\"/doc/723210/\" id=\"a_33\">Ranjit\n\nConstruction Co. Ltd. v. National Highways Authority of India</a>,\n\nAIR 2004 Delhi 64. He has insisted that in respect of Global Tenders,\n\nthe bidder if commits mistake of this nature, he must suffer and the\n\npetition must be dismissed.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">34.          We have minutely examined respective submissions made\n\nby learned counsel for the parties and perused the record with their able\n\nassistance.

In para 14 the petitioner has categorically asserted that\n\nthe petitioner&#x27;s bid of Rs. 27,69,17,000.00 (without taxes etc.) being\n\nthe lowest was accepted and it was on the basis of the aforementioned\n\nacceptance that the letter of award was required to be issued.\n\nHowever, in clause 3 of the letter of award, issued on 25.3.2008\n\n(P-10), the total contract price given is far less because it has taken\n\ninto account the omission of digits &#x27;46&#x27; in respect of Siliguri. Once,\n\nthe total price is correctly given in Schedule 3(III), it would be absurd\n\nto insist on the printing error which omitted two digits of &#x27;46&#x27;. The\n\nabsurdity of such an argument is further exposed if the Excise Duty\n\npayable at 19% (16% + 3%) is noticed in Column No. 11. The Excise\n\nDuty calculated is Rs. 15,265,226.24. If the misprinted price of Rs.\n\n314,400.00 is taken into account then it is not understandable how the\n\nExcise Duty of Rs. 15,265,226.24 at the rate of 19% could be worked\n\nout. It is further clear that the figure of 314,400.00 commences with a\n\n&#x27;,&#x27; (comma), which indicates that some digit is missing. Likewise, the\n\nletter &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; is missing in the heading of the second page.\n\nInstead of writing &#x27;PURENA&#x27; the heading shows &#x27;URENA&#x27;. We\n\nhave further noticed numerous mistakes in para 10 of the counter\n\naffidavit filed by the respondent. For example, the letter of award has\n\nactually been issued on 25.3.2008 but it only says &#x27;5..08&#x27;. Likewise,\n\ninstead of writing Column No. 18, &#x27;Column 8.&#x27; has been mentioned.\n\nThe process of settlement of dispute by Arbitration is provided by\n\nclause 32 of GCC but the respondent has stated &#x27;Clause 2.0 and 33.0&#x27;.\n\nTo err is human and to permit correction of such error is equitable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\"> C.W.P.

A public servant\n\nwho is at the helm of affairs and is competent to permit such\n\ncorrections may not have undertaken this exercise on account of fear\n\nof fastening of responsibility. However, such a thinking cannot be\n\nsupported because it should also be remembered that such an officer\n\nmay have to answer such a huge contradictions between the prices of\n\nReactors for Purnea and Sonepat on the one hand and Siliguri on the\n\nother hand.    He could be questioned why he has purchased the\n\nReactors for such an exorbitant price for Purnea and Sonepat and how\n\nthe price is so low for Siliguri. It follows that patent error of the\n\nnature which has surfaced in the present case, should have been\n\ncorrected by the competent officer and this unnecessary litigation\n\ncould be avoided. It amounts to making hill out of a mole, which is\n\nhardly appreciable. It is on account of frivolous litigation of this\n\nnature that the projects are delayed, cost is enhanced and inefficiency\n\ncreeps in. All this was avoidable in the present case. However, the\n\nrespondent has preferred the course of litigation. Therefore, we find\n\nthat a strict technical view is not required to be taken because if the\n\nbid of the petitioner is not accepted as per corrections then the second\n\nlowest bidder would be invited for execution of the contract. The\n\ntotal bid price excluding Excise Duty, CST and other levies quoted by\n\nthe petitioner and accepted by the respondent is Rs. 27,69,17,000/-,\n\nwhereas the second lowest bidder has quoted the price of Rs.\n\n40,46,056,000/- and the third bidder has quoted Rs. 41,65,70,000/-.\n\nThe respondent is a public corporation and, therefore, larger public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\"> C.W.P.

The argument of the learned counsel that only\n\narithmetical errors could have been corrected by virtue of provisions\n\nmade in clause 23.2 of the ITB and the unit price was to prevail,\n\nwould not require any detailed consideration. Clause 23.2 of the ITB\n\nreads as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">             &quot;23.2 Arithmetical errors will be rectified on the\n\n                    following basis.

If the supplier does not accept the\n\n                    correction of the errors, its Bid will be rejected. If\n\n                    there is a discrepancy between words and figures,\n\n                    the amount in words will prevail.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">38.          A perusal of the aforementioned clause would show that\n\nit applies only to arithmetical errors and not to the printing errors. If\n\nthe aforesaid clause is applied then the printing of &#x27;,&#x27; (comma) before\n\nthe figures of &#x27;314,400.00&#x27; would be redundant and there would be\n\nabsurdity in comparing the Excise Duty and Cess worked out on the\n\nbasis of printing error.         Moreover, clause 23.2 only talks of\n\narithmetical errors and not of printing errors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"55804\" id=\"span_54\">39.

Borough of Fairview, 304 NJ Super 425.\n\nThere the claim for rectification of mistake was allowed because\n\nSpina discovered that its secretary had erroneously indicated the unit\n\nprice for one of the items as 400 dollars per square yard though it\n\nshould have been 4 dollars per square yard as reflected in the total bid\n\nfor that work. When the request for correction was not accepted by\n\nthe Borough, it instituted an action claiming that the Borough\n\narbitrarily failed to recognize that its bid was lower than that of the\n\nsuccessful company. It was held that the error in the bid was non-\n\nmaterial and subject to waiver. The error was considered as patent\n\nand the failure to waive the deviation would thwart the public bidding\n\nlaws.
