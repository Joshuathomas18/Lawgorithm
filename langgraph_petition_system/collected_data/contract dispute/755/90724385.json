Dr. George also submitted that the law is well settled that if an\n                              invocation is not made strictly in terms of the BG, then no payment can\n                              be claimed through the said demand and an injunction would legitimately\n                              follow. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"787550\" id=\"span_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"137515356\" id=\"span_39\">In this regard, Dr. George relied upon the Judgments in the cases\n                              of <a href=\"/doc/137515356/\" id=\"a_1\">EMCO Limited vs. Malvika Steel Limited &amp; Ors.</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/787550/\" id=\"a_2\">2012) SCC\n                              OnLine Del 5763, and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited vs. Jai Prakash\n                              Hyundai Consortium</a>, (2006) 88 DRJ 332 (DB).</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                              12.       According to Dr. George, respondent No.2 / HSCL has sought\n                              to set up an entirely new case before this Court that it was entitled to\n                              invoke the BGs within 90 days of the expiry of the defect liability period,\n                              and that the said period has not started till date and will purportedly not\n                              start till the NTPC completes the risk-and-cost contract against HSCL\n                              which is an indeterminate date in the future. In this regard, Dr. George\n                              submitted that the said argument of respondent No.2 / HSCL is not only a\n                              complete afterthought, the same is unmeritorious.

According to him, in construction contracts, the defect liability\n                              period by its very nature begins after the work is completed. When a\n                              construction contract is terminated much prior to completion of the work,\n                              the defect liability period would not even begin to run. To support his\n                              view, he has relied upon the Judgments in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/124949188/\" id=\"a_3\">National\n                              Highways Authority of India vs. Bridge &amp; Roof Co.

Hence, from this\n                              perspective also, the argument of respondent No.2 / HSCL is unmerited.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">                              14.      Furthermore, it is submitted that the stand of respondent No.2 /\n                              HSCL is contrary to its own unequivocal position as taken by them in a\n                              judicial proceeding before this Court when it sought to secure an\n                              injunction against encashment of BGs tendered by them to NTPC. As the\n                              work awarded by respondent No.2 / HSCL to the appellant / plaintiff was\n                              on a back-to-back basis, it was subject to the identical contractual terms\n                              and conditions, as applicable between respondent No.2 / HSCL and\n                              NTPC, and accordingly, the BGs advanced by respondent No.2 / HSCL\n                              to the appellant / plaintiff.

It is stated that respondent No.2 /\n                              HSCL took a categorical position that the case fell under the second\n                              category i.e., of termination, and that there was no question of awaiting\n                              the expiry of any defect liability period. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1917378\" id=\"span_51\">Therefore, respondent No.2 /\n                              HSCL&#x27;s own interpretation of identically worded BGs in the context of\n                              termination of the contract has been that (i) the act of termination would\n                              trigger the 90 days period, (ii) that the BGs could not be encashed beyond\n                              the said 90-days period, and (iii) that in the event of termination, the\n                              defect liability period would be inconsequential and inapplicable.\n                              Respondent No.2 / HSCL evidently cannot be permitted to adopt a\n                              diametrically opposite stand in an identical factual scenario and identical\n                              BG terms qua the appellant / plaintiff. In this regard, Dr. George stated\n                              that it is trite law that a party cannot be permitted to approbate and\n                              reprobate at the same time, and the same is based on the principle of the\n                              doctrine of election. To support his stand, he has relied upon the\n                              Judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1917378/\" id=\"a_5\">Cauvery Coffee Traders, Mangalore vs. Hornor\n                              Resources (International) Co.

Dr. George stated that respondent No.2 / HSCL&#x27;s argument that\n                              the appellant / plaintiff had extended the tenure of the BGs and thus\n                              consented to an extended claim period is erroneous, as the BGs were\n                              extended without any change in terms i.e., the extended BGs also\n                              contained Clause 3 and the stipulation that the BGs could only be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">Digitally Signed By:ASHEESH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">KUMAR YADAV                     RFA 238/2020                                                Page 10 of 48</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signing Date:20.07.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">14:19:10</span>\n                               invoked within 90 days period from the date of cancellation of the\n                              contract. The claim period under a BG is strictly controlled by the terms\n                              contained in the BG, and it cannot be argued that the right to invoke the\n                              BG continued beyond the express period for the same mentioned in the\n                              BG. In this regard, Dr. George relied upon the Judgment in the case of\n                              <a href=\"/doc/684026/\" id=\"a_6\">Makharia Brothers vs. State of Nagaland &amp; Ors.</a>, (2000) 10 SCC 503.\n                              Respondent No.2 / HSCL&#x27;s argument is characterised by a mistaken\n                              equivalence between the expiry date of a BG and the claim period\n                              contained therein. However, the law is to the contrary. The expiry date of\n                              the BG is completely different from the claim-period validity, as both\n                              have completely different connotations in commercial law.</span> To support\n                              his view, Dr. George has relied upon the Judgment in the case of Preeti\n                              Industries and Ors. vs. The Chairman, Himachal Pradesh State\n                              Electricity Board Ltd. and Ors., (2019) SCC OnLine HP 1344.

The same is a material\n                              factor inasmuch as the issuing entity itself is categorical that the BGs\n                              could not have been invoked by respondent No.2 / HSCL in the manner\n                              in which it has sought to do so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                              16.

Therefore, the Minutes of Meeting demonstrate the\n                                      solemn, considered, and unconditional admission on the part of\n                                      respondent No.2 / HSCL of the amounts due to the appellant /\n                                      plaintiff.

In the said proceedings,\n                                     NTPC had sought a counter-claim for a sum of ₹12.14 Crore\n                                     from respondent No.2 / HSCL on account of recovery of\n                                     amount against material issued and not returned / unaccounted\n                                     at the site.

It is submitted by Dr. George that the impugned Judgment /\n                              order dated February 17, 2020, caused serious injustice to the appellant /\n                              plaintiff.

On the other hand, Mr. Rakesh Sinha, learned counsel\n                              appearing on behalf of respondent No.2 / HSCL contended that BGs have\n                              been duly invoked by respondent No.2 / HSCL in accordance with the\n                              provisions / clauses of the BGs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_44\">                              39.      Mr. Sinha submitted that the above-stated arguments is based\n                              on an incomplete and partial reading of Clause 3 and the other terms of\n                              the BG including the extension letters dated May 28, 2008, and\n                              November 26, 2008, respectively. The proper reading of Clause 3 of the\n                              BGs shows that the BG could be invoked either within 90 days of\n                              contract cancellation or expiry of the defect liability period. The words\n                              ―as the case may be‖ in Clause 3 of the BGs vested discretion in\n                              respondent No.2 / HSCL as to when the BGs could be invoked so long\n                              such invocation was during the validity of the BGs. According to Mr.\n                              Sinha, the underlying contract was cancelled by the principal employer\n                              i.e., NTPC in parts lastly by their letters (Ref.

NTPC had\n                              put respondent No.2 / HSCL to notice that the works shall be completed\n                              through other agencies at their risk and cost. He further stated that as per\n                              the LOAs dated March 03, 2004, and April 06, 2004, the appellant /\n                              plaintiff was required to complete the subcontracted work respectively by\n                              March 31, 2006, and July 31, 2006. Consequently, respondent No.2 /\n                              HSCL had cancelled the subcontracts of the appellant / plaintiff from\n                              time to time and lastly by its letters (No. DGM/Klgn/HEW/07/751 and\n                              No. DGM/Klgn/HEW/07/752) both dated September 05, 2007. The GCC\n                              between NTPC and respondent No.2 / HSCL was incorporated by\n                              reference in the subcontracts between respondent No.2 / HSCL and the\n                              appellant / plaintiff. As per Condition No.33 of the GCC r/w Schedule\n                              A, the defect liability period was 12 months from the date of completion.\n                              The balance structural work was then yet to be completed by the agency\n                              appointed by NTPC and hence the defect liability period had not\n                              commenced. At that stage respondent No.2 / HSCL had made a tentative\n                              assessment of its losses which by far exceeded the BG amounts. Hence,\n                              respondent No.2 / HSCL was well within its rights to invoke the BG\n                              within its validity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">                              40.

Further, Clause 2 of the BGs makes\n                              the owner the sole judge of whether the contractor (appellant / plaintiff)\n                              had committed any breach and the extent of loss resulting from such\n                              breach and the decision of the owner is final and binding on the bank.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">Digitally Signed By:ASHEESH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">KUMAR YADAV                     RFA 238/2020                                                 Page 25 of 48</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">Signing Date:20.07.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">14:19:10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">                               That apart, he submitted that as per Clause 4 of the BGs, the bank was\n                              not released of its liability even if the owner postpones enforcement or\n                              forbears from enforcing its rights against the contractor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">                              41.       It is submitted by Mr. Sinha that a combined reading of the BG\n                              Clauses unequivocally demonstrates that respondent No.2 / HSCL had\n                              rightly invoked the BG in accordance with the BG terms. Respondent\n                              No.1 / Punjab &amp; Sind Bank was required to honour their guarantee and\n                              pay on demand by respondent No.2 / HSCL without any demur\n                              regardless of the underlying disputes between respondent No.2 / HSCL\n                              and the appellant / plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">                              42.       Moreover, Mr. Sinha submitted that the argument of the\n                              appellant / plaintiff further ought to be discarded in view of the extension\n                              of the BG from May 31, 2008, to May 28, 2009 by way of extension\n                              letters dated May 28, 2008, and November 26, 2008, respectively.\n                              According to the appellant / plaintiff, the BGs were invocable after\n                              December 04, 2007. However, the BG was extended even after\n                              December 2007 i.e., up to May 28, 2009, by way of extension letters\n                              issued by respondent No.1 / Punjab &amp; Sind Bank at the request of the\n                              appellant / plaintiff. Mr. Sinha stated that had the contention of the\n                              appellant / plaintiff been correct, then there was no occasion for\n                              extending the BG beyond December 04, 2007. According to Mr. Sinha, it\n                              is inconceivable that respondent No.1 / Punjab &amp; Sind Bank on behalf of\n                              the appellant / plaintiff had issued the said extension letters to respondent\n                              No.2 / HSCL merely as an empty and idle formality and they did not\n                              carry any meaning or create any rights / liabilities in favour of the parties.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">Digitally Signed By:ASHEESH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">KUMAR YADAV                     RFA 238/2020                                                   Page 26 of 48</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">Signing Date:20.07.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">14:19:10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">                               43.

In this regard, Mr. Sinha submitted that\n                              the ex parte ad interim order dated September 28, 2010, cannot be treated\n                              as a binding precedent.

Therefore, the basis on which special equities are claimed by\n                              the appellant / plaintiff does not exist. In addition, Mr. Sinha stated that\n                              the appellant / plaintiff themself has filed Civil Suit No. 212 / 2018\n                              before the Calcutta High Court seeking a money decree against\n                              respondent No.2 / HSCL on the basis of conditional Minutes of the\n                              Meeting dated October 08, 2015. However, the suit is pending\n                              adjudication. He stated, this Court may further take judicial notice of the\n                              order dated January 03, 2020, that has been passed by the Calcutta High\n                              Court declining to entertain the appellant&#x27;s / plaintiff application for\n                              Judgment upon admission. Thus, the appellant&#x27;s / plaintiff claim on the\n                              basis of the Minutes of Meeting dated October 08, 2015, is not\n                              crystallised and forms the subject matter of pending proceedings before\n                              the Calcutta High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1357066\" id=\"span_160\">49.       Mr. Sinha further submitted that regarding the rule of\n                              admissibility of evidence, it is well established that in the absence of any\n                              pleading, no evidence produced by parties can be considered.

The\n                              terms of the BGs in those cases are not identical to the BG terms of the\n                              present case.

However, the\n                              invocation of the BGs in the present case was done on May 21, 2009, i.e.,\n                              much after the period of 90 days expiry period.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                              58.       The stand of respondent No.2 / HSCL as contended by Mr.\n                              Sinha is that the appellant / plaintiff had extended the validity of the BGs\n                              from time to time and the last extension being valid till May 28, 2009, the\n                              HSCL was justified is invoking the BGs. The said plea is not appealing\n                              for the reason that it is one thing to say that the contract is terminated and\n                              other thing to say that the validity of the BGs has been extended. The\n                              intent of the terms of the BGs is that it needs to be invoked within 90\n                              days of the cancellation of the contract which admittedly has not been\n                              done. Even the plea that the BGs could have been invoked within 90\n                              days of the defect liability period and the work having not been\n                              completed with a new contractor appointed by the NTPC, the BGs could\n                              be invoked after that period is not appealing for more than one reason, (i)\n                              as stated by Dr. George, the contract has been terminated, there is no\n                              concept of defect liability period, and (ii) the contract does not\n                              contemplate expiry of the defect liability period after the final execution\n                              of the work by a third contractor appointed by NTPC. It is only when, the\n                              defect liability period had expired after the completion of the work, as\n                              assigned to the appellant / plaintiff by HSCL.

The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is\n                                       by now well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings\n                                       an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the\n                                       beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms\n                                       thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving\n                                       such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms\n                                       irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The very\n                                       purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be\n                                       defeated. The Courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an\n                                       injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee.\n                                       The Courts have carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in\n                                       connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very\n                                       foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there is such a\n                                       fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can\n                                       be restrained from doing so. The second exception relates to\n                                       cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional bank\n                                       guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one\n                                       of the parties concerned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                                       xxx                          xxx                           xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                                       15. Clearly, therefore, the existence of any dispute between the\n                                       parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an injunction\n                                       to restrain the enforcement of batik guarantees. There must be\n                                       a fraud in connection with the bank guarantee. In the present\n                                       case we fail to see any such fraud. The High Court seems to\n                                       have come to the conclusion that the termination of the contract\n                                       by the Appellant and his claim that the time was of the essence\n                                       of the contract, are not based on the terms of the contract and\n                                       therefore, there is a fraud in the invocation of the bank\n                                       guarantee. This is an erroneous view. The disputes between the\n                                       parties relating to the termination of the contract cannot make\n                                       invocation of the bank guarantees fraudulent. The High Court\n                                       has also referred to the conduct of the Appellant in invoking the\n                                       bank guarantees on an earlier occasion on 12th of April, 1992\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">Digitally Signed By:ASHEESH</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">KUMAR YADAV                     RFA 238/2020                                               Page 41 of 48</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">Signing Date:20.07.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">14:19:10</span>\n                                         and subsequently withdrawing such invocation. The Court has\n                                        used this circumstance in aid of its view that the time was not of\n                                        the essence of the contract. We fail to see how an earlier\n                                        invocation of the bank guarantee and subsequent withdrawal of\n                                        this invocation make the bunk guarantees or their invocation\n                                        tainted with fraud in any manner. Under the terms of the\n                                        contract it is stipulated that the Respondent is required to give\n                                        unconditional bank guarantees against advance payments as\n                                        also a similar bank guarantee for due delivery of the contracted\n                                        plant within the stipulated period. In the absence of any fraud\n                                        the Appellant is entitled to realise the bank guarantees.‖\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"124949188\" id=\"span_237\">65.
