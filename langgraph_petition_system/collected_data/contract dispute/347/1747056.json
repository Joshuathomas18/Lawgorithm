In cases of international\n          commercial arbitration held out of India provisions of Part I would\n     \n\n\n\n          apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude\n          all or any of its provisions.

Accordingly, in any matter brought before the Court in an\n    international commercial arbitration, the question of jurisdiction of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    court for any application under Part I of the 1996 Act has to be decided\n    by considering whether or not the parties have by agreement, express or\n    implied, excluded the particular provision of Part I under which such\n    application is made. If the provision is so excluded, it will not apply and\n    the court will have no jurisdiction to consider any relief under such\n    provision.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:55:23 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">                                         :11:                     arbp-636-11.doc\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">    22.

It is now firmly established that\n     the arbitration agreement which creates these obligations is a\n     separate contract, distinct from the substantive agreement in which\n     it is usually embeded, capable of surviving the termination of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n     substantive agreement and susceptible of premature termination, in\n     much the same manner as in more ordinary forms of contract.\n     Since this agreement has a distinct life of its own, it may in\n     principle be governed by a proper law of its own, which need not\n     be the same as the law governing the substantive contract.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                        \n                        \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">     The second group of obligations, consisting of what is generally\n     referred to as the &#x27;curial law&#x27; of the arbitration, concerns the\n                       \n     manner in which the parties and the arbitrator are required to\n     conduct the reference of a particular dispute. According to the\n     English theory of arbitration, these rules are to be ascertained by\n      \n\n\n     reference to the express or implied terms of the agreement to\n   \n\n\n\n     arbitrate. This being so, it will be found in the great majority of\n     cases that the curial law, i.e. the law governing the conduct of the\n     reference, is the same as the law governing the obligation to\n\n\n\n\n\n     arbitrate. It is, however, open to the parties to submit, expressly or\n     by implication, the conduct of the reference to a different law from\n     the one governing the underlying arbitration agreement. In such a\n\n\n\n\n\n     case, the court looks first at the arbitration agreement to see\n     whether the dispute is one which should be arbitrated, and which\n     has validly been made the subject of the reference, it then looks\n     to the curial law to see how that reference should be conducted\n     and then returns to the first law in order to give effect to the\n     resulting award.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:55:23 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                                         :13:                    arbp-636-11.doc\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n           It may therefore be seen that problems arising out of an arbitration\n           may, at least in theory, call for the application of any one or more\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n           of the following laws:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           1.

In my view\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    there is a fundamental fallacy in this argument.                The argument\n    presupposes that curial law/law governing the conduct of arbitration\n    covers the entire field of Part I of the 1996 Act, so that its choice alone\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    would ipso facto exclude the applicability of the Part I. This is far from\n    correct.

The questions as to (i) whether there is in existence a valid\n                           \n    arbitration agreement between the parties, (ii) whether a valid notice of\n    arbitration is given by the party requiring arbitration and (iii) whether and\n    what kind of arbitral tribunal needs to be constituted, all of which arise in\n        \n\n\n    an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act for appointment of an\n     \n\n\n\n    arbitrator, are governed by the proper law of the arbitration\n    agreement,     whereas questions which arise in pending arbitration\n\n\n\n\n\n    reference such as protection of the property involved in an arbitration\n    which are the subject matter of an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 9</a> of the 1996\n    Act are governed by the curial law i.e. the law governing the conduct\n    of individual reference.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_32\">27.

The arbitrator is not obliged by law to file his\n                           \n          award in court but he may be asked by the party seeking to enforce\n          the award to do so. The need to file an award in court arises only if\n          it is required to be enforced, and the need to challenge it arises if it\n          is being enforced. The enforcement process is subsequent to and\n        \n\n          independent of the proceedings before the arbitrator. It is not\n          governed by the curial or procedural law that governed the\n     \n\n\n\n          procedure that the arbitrator followed in the conduct of the\n          arbitration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_34\">The Supreme Court in Sumitomo expressly rejected the argument\n    of Mr.Sorabji <a href=\"/doc/1045460/\" id=\"a_51\">in that case</a> that the procedural law would determine what\n    judicial remedies were available to a party &quot;who wishes to challenge the\n    award once it has been rendered and before it is sought to enforce it\n\n\n\n\n\n    abroad&quot; and &quot;that the court that administered the curial law of\n    arbitration had the jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the award&quot;.\n    The Supreme Court added emphatically.</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          &quot;15.

Singer Company &amp;\n                            \n    Ors., 1992 (3) S.C.C. 551, their Lordships have held that the parties\n    have freedom to choose the law governing an international commercial\n    arbitration agreement. They may choose the substantive law governing\n        \n\n\n    the arbitration agreement as well as the procedural law governing the\n     \n\n\n\n    conduct of arbitration. Such choice is exercised either expressly or by\n    implication. Where there is no express choice of law governing contract\n\n\n\n\n\n    as a whole, or the arbitration agreement in particular, there is, in the\n    absence of any contrary indication, a presumption that the parties have\n    intended that the proper law of the contract as well as the law governing\n    the arbitration agreement are the same as the law of the country in which\n\n\n\n\n\n    the arbitration is agreed to be held. On the other hand, where the proper\n    law of the contract is expressly chosen by the parties, such law must, in\n    the absence of an unmistakable intention to the contrary, govern the\n    arbitration agreement which, though collateral or ancillary to the main\n    contract, is never the less a part of such contract.

They have further stated that the &#x27;Contract shall in all\n          respects be construed and governed according to Indian laws&#x27;.\n          These words are wide enough to engulf every question arising\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n          under the contract including the disputes between the parties and\n          the mode of settlement. It was in Delhi that the agreement was\n          executed. The form of the agreement is closely related to the system\n          of law in India. Various Indian enactments are specifically\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n          mentioned in the agreement as applicable to it in many respects.\n          The contract is to be performed in India with the aid of Indian\n                            \n          workmen whose conditions of service are regulated by Indian laws.\n          One of the parties to the contract is a public sector undertaking.\n          The contract has in every respect the closest and most real\n                           \n          connection with the Indian system of law and it is by that law that\n          the parties have expressly evinced their intention to be bound in all\n          respects. The arbitration agreement is contained in one of the\n          clauses of the contract, and not in a separate agreement. In the\n        \n\n          absence of any indication to the contrary, the governing law of the\n          contract (i.e., in the words of Dicey, the proper law of the contract)\n     \n\n\n\n          being Indian law, it is that system of law which must necessarily\n          govern matters concerning arbitration, although in certain\n          respects the law of the place of arbitration may have its relevance\n          in regard to procedural matters.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">          45. It is true that an arbitration agreement may be regarded as a\n          collateral or ancillary contract in the sense that it survives to\n          determine the claims of the parties and the mode of settlement of\n\n\n\n\n\n          their disputes even after the breach or repudiation of the main\n          contract. But it is not an independent contract, and it has no\n          meaningful existence except in relation to the rights and liabilities\n          of the parties under the main contract. It is a procedural\n          machinery which is activated when disputes arise between parties\n          regarding their rights and liabilities. The law governing such\n          rights and liabilities is the proper law of the contract, and unless\n          otherwise provided, such law governs the whole contract including\n          the arbitration agreement, and particularly so when the latter is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:55:23 :::</span>\n                                        :19:                     arbp-636-11.doc\n\n          contained not in a separate agreement but, as in the present case,\n          in one of the clauses of the main contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">    31.   It is clear from the contract in the instant case that the arbitration\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    agreement is contained in one of the clauses of the contract and not a\n    separate agreement. The governing law of the contract being the English\n    Law, it is that system of law which must necessarily govern the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    arbitration agreement and its enforcement in the absence of any indication\n    of the contrary. In the instant case, thus the proper law of the arbitration\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    agreement is the same as the proper law of the underlying contract,\n    which, as mentioned above, is the English Law.\n</p>                             \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">    32.

In view of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_56\">English Arbitration Act</a> set out in\n    Paragraph 32 and 33 above and the seat of the arbitration in the case\n    herein being    admittedly in England, the award made can only be\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    challenged before the courts in England according to the applicable\n    English Law, namely, the English Arbitration Act, 1996. The Indian Law,\n    namely, Part 1 of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_57\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a> clearly stands excluded so far\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    as challenge to an arbitration award is concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">    35.\n                            \n          There is yet another ground on which the aforesaid conclusion can\n                           \n    be reached. It also arises out of the express agreement between the\n    parties. As noted above, the express agreement between the parties\n    stipulates that Rules of the Refined Sugar Association, London form part\n        \n\n\n    of the contract, if they are not inconsistent with the other provisions of\n     \n\n\n\n    the contract. The first clause relied upon by the Respondent from the\n    Introduction/Preamble to the Rules of Refined Sugar Association relating\n    to Arbitration reads as under :\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">          &quot;When the parties to a contract have incorporated a clause to the\n          effect that any dispute arising out of it shall be referred to The\n          Refined Sugar Association (sometimes referred to as the RSA) such\n\n\n\n\n\n          dispute may be referred to the Association for settlement in\n          accordance with the Rules relating to <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_58\">Arbitration and the\n          Arbitration Act, 1996</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">    36.   From the above clause, it is clear that once the parties to the\n    contract incorporate a clause to the effect that any dispute arising out of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:55:23 :::</span>\n                                         :21:                    arbp-636-11.doc\n\n    the contract shall be referred to the Refined Sugar Association, such\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n    dispute must be settled in accordance with the Rules relating to\n    Arbitration and English Arbitration Act, 1996. Therefore even on this\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    analysis it is clear that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain\n    the present Petition under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n    Act, 1996.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                      \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">    37.   Again, the second clause relied upon by the Respondent from the\n    Introduction/Preamble to the Rules of Refined Sugar Association relating\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    to Arbitration reads as under :\n</p>                              \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">          &quot;The Association&#x27;s Rules and Arbitration procedures are\n                             \n          conducted    in accordance with English Law. However, where the\n          parties have agreed a contract law other than English, the\n          Association may, with       the   parties&#x27; agreement,       decide       the\n        \n\n\n          dispute.&quot;\n</blockquote>     \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">    38.   The above Clause clearly stipulates that the Association&#x27;s Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n    and Arbitration procedures are conducted in accordance with English\n    Law and it is only where the parties have agreed to a contract law other\n    than English, the association may, with the parties agreement decide the\n\n\n\n\n\n    dispute. In the present case, the parties have not agreed to any contract\n    law other than English.   In view of categorical assertion in the clause set\n    out hereinabove that the Association Rules and Arbitration procedures are\n    conducted in accordance with English law coupled with the fact that the\n    parties have expressly agreed to be governed by the Association&#x27;s Rules\n    relating to arbitration, there remains no doubt in concluding that the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:55:23 :::</span>\n                                         :22:                     arbp-636-11.doc\n\n    parties have expressly agreed that the arbitration would be conducted in\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    accordance with the English law. Again in Rule 8 it is clearly stated that\n    &quot;For the purpose of all proceedings in arbitration, the contract shall be\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    deemed to have been made in England, ........England shall be regarded as\n    the place of performance, disputes shall be settled according to the law of\n    England............. The seat of the arbitration shall be England and all\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    proceedings shall take place in England..........&quot; In view thereof, nothing\n    turns on the issue raised by the Petitioner that the Respondents have not\n    exactly incorporated the recommended arbitration clause which include a\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    condition that &quot;such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with\n                             \n    English Law&quot;.        As set out hereinabove, the introduction to the\n    Association&#x27;s Rules/Preambles provide that the arbitration proceedings\n                            \n    are generally conducted in accordance with English Law except where\n    the parties have agreed to a contract law other than English. In view\n    thereof, though it is beyond any doubt from the aforestated decisions of\n        \n\n\n    the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that the curial law does not govern the\n     \n\n\n\n    question pertaining to the maintainability of the present Petitions<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_60\"> u/s.34</a>\n    of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996, it is established that the\n\n\n\n\n\n    parties herein have agreed to the Association&#x27;s Rules and arbitration\n    procedures being conducted in accordance with English law and Mr.\n    Chinoy is not correct in his submission that the agreement contains no\n    provision stipulating a choice of law governing the arbitration procedure.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">    39.
