The petitioner&#x27;s request for review was declined by the\n                     respondent who, vide the letter dated 21.05.2021, advised the petitioner to\n                     immediately take back the equipment provided by it against the supply order\n                     dated 27.03.2021. The petitioner, however, vide its letters dated 24.05.2021,\n                     27.05.2021, and 31.05.2021, reiterated its request for review of the impugned\n                     order, but to no avail. It is in these circumstances that the present petition\n                     came to be filed before this Court on 17.06.2021.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">                     9.    On 29.07.2021, after learned senior counsel for the petitioner had\n                     concluded their submissions, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of\n                     the AIIMS had raised an objection regarding the maintainability of the\n                     petition by contending that the contractual relationship between the parties\n                     was governed by the supply order dated 27.03.2021, which contained an\n                     arbitration clause and had, therefore, contended that if aggrieved, the\n                     petitioner ought to seek arbitration in accordance with Clause 15 contained in\n                     Annexure 2 of the said supply order. He had urged that in view of the self-\n                     imposed judicial policy of limiting exercise of the extraordinary powers of\n                     the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, when an alternative and\n                     equally efficacious remedy is available with a litigant, it ought to be made to\n                     pursue the said remedy instead of being given a free reign to invoke the\n                     special jurisdiction of this Court. He also had urged that since the petitioner&#x27;s\n                     termination had been duly effected as per the terms of the TED, and most of\n                     the issues raised by the petitioner were disputed and raised complex questions\n                     of facts pertaining to the terms and conditions of the AIIMS, SB tender - all\n                     of which required oral evidence, this Court, ought to decline the exercise of\n                     its writ jurisdiction and relegate the petitioner to arbitration in accordance\n                     with the terms of the contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                     10.   In rebuttal, learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted that an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 10 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">13:34:29</span>\n                      arbitrator had very little power to deal with the issues raised in the present\n                     petition. The petitioner had been debarred, which, in effect, was an act of\n                     blacklisting; given that the consequences of blacklisting travelled far beyond\n                     the dealings with any one particular government entity and had real time\n                     consequences on the entire business of the petitioner company, even if\n                     termination of the contract could be assailed in arbitration, an order of\n                     blacklisting could not. It was then submitted that an arbitrator is, after all, a\n                     creature of the agreement and impugning an act of blacklisting was a public\n                     law action, not contractual; therefore, any order to blacklist an entity\n                     demanded public law remedies that could only be granted by a Court with\n                     writ jurisdiction. It was further submitted that the arbitrator, in any event,\n                     does not have any power to apply the test under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\n                     of India and other public law principles liable to be invoked in the facts of the\n                     present case, such as the doctrine of arbitrariness, for the purpose of setting\n                     aside a debarment order - only a Constitutional Court was empowered to do\n                     that. It was, therefore, submitted that arbitration could not be considered an\n                     equally efficacious remedy in any manner. It was finally urged, without\n                     prejudice to the aforesaid, that jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 226</a> of the\n                     Constitution is neither excluded in the presence of an arbitration agreement,\n                     nor is the availability of an alternate remedy an absolute bar to writ\n                     jurisdiction. Subsequent to the response given by the petitioner, the learned\n                     Solicitor General did not really press the point of maintainability any further\n                     and, instead, chose to address his contentions on merits.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">                     11.   Before referring to the submissions made by the parties on merits, it\n                     may be noted that while this petition was being heard, the petitioner received\n                     communications from two medical institutions; two letters from the Sawai\n                     Man Singh Hospital at Jaipur, declaring the bids made by the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 11 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">13:34:29</span>\n                      through its distributors under NIB No. 1350 dated 28.04.2021 non-responsive\n                     on account of the impugned order, and one letter from King George&#x27;s\n                     Medical University at Lucknow on 29.07.2021, where the petitioner currently\n                     stands engaged in a contract, seeking clarifications in respect of its continued\n                     engagement. These letters were placed on record by the petitioner in support\n                     of its plea that the impugned order not only affects its business relationship\n                     with the respondent, but also has a cascading effect on its business\n                     relationship with other medical institutions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">                     12.   Learned senior counsel Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. Saurabh Kirpal,\n                     advanced submissions on behalf of the petitioner. It was submitted that the\n                     petitioner, being a global healthcare and medical technology company present\n                     in over 65 countries, as a brand enjoys tremendous goodwill in the market\n                     and is a well-regarded name in the industry. For this reason, the petitioner has\n                     always ensured that its actions do not offend any national laws or regulations\n                     and the petitioner, even in the present case, has not indulged in any unethical\n                     practices or concealment of material facts in respect of the tender in question.\n                     It was contended that, for starters, the impugned order is premised on a\n                     wholly erroneous interpretation of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision and other terms\n                     and conditions of the TED. It was submitted that the terms and conditions of\n                     the TED did not at all make it incumbent on the bidder to either provide the\n                     lowest prices to the respondent, or disclose the rates offered in all recently\n                     executed contracts for ascertaining the reasonability of prices quoted by the\n                     bidder. It was urged that the contractual provision that required bidders to\n                     disclose rates in recently executed contracts could be invoked only in case of\n                     tenders with identical terms and conditions, which is clearly not the case here.\n                     Given that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; could only come into effect after the petitioner\n                     and the respondent had executed the contract between themselves, there was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 12 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">13:34:29</span>\n                      no question of the petitioner disclosing details of the contract with the NCI\n                     which was executed much earlier. It was submitted that the petitioner earned\n                     a major part of its revenue from the number of consumables ordered, which\n                     differed in the case of the orders placed by the NCI and AIIMS, SB, therefore\n                     they were substantially different and could not be compared. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"438325\" id=\"span_61\">The petitioner\n                     had, in fact, made this position very clear when it sent a price disclaimer to\n                     the respondent on 07.11.2019, prior to submitting its bid, stating that it may\n                     have quoted lower prices for the equipment earlier, depending on the terms of\n                     sale and other conditions applicable during the pendency of such other\n                     contract. It was urged that even otherwise when the petitioner had submitted\n                     its bid on 15.11.2019, there was admittedly no concluded contract with the\n                     NCI at that point and, therefore, the petitioner could not be expected to\n                     furnish details of its contract which it entered into with the NCI only on\n                     19.03.2020, in its bid submitted much prior thereto, i.e., on 15.11.2019. It\n                     was, thus, contended that there was no question of the petitioner having\n                     deliberately concealed any information from the respondent and indulging in\n                     any corrupt or fraudulent practice under Clause 48 of the TED. Further, by\n                     placing reliance on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/438325/\" id=\"a_6\">Mekaster Trading Corporation Vs.\n                     Union of India &amp;Ors.</a> 2003 (71) DRJ 376 and Rama Pandey Vs. Union of\n                     India &amp; Anr. ILR (2009) 6 Del 752, Mr.Rohatgi urged that even otherwise,\n                     the impugned order was wholly cryptic and does not deal with the primary\n                     defense of the petitioner that when the quantity of consumables and\n                     accessories ordered by the NCI and AIIMS, SB were very different, the\n                     contracts with each of them could not be called identical at all. Finally, it was\n                     contended that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision, which the respondent has invoked\n                     in the impugned order, is wholly inapplicable to the facts of the present case,\n                     as the said clause has a very limited purpose of vesting the respondent with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 13 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">13:34:29</span>\n                      the option of seeking a price reduction- which was not the case here as the\n                     petitioner did not receive any request from the respondent for reducing the\n                     price of the goods being supplied under the subject contract. Moreover, it was\n                     specifically reiterated that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; could be invoked to seek a price\n                     reduction only upon a comparison with identical contracts having the same\n                     terms and conditions which, it was urged, was not the position in the present\n                     case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">                     13.     It was then submitted that the impugned order was arbitrary,\n                     discriminatory and completely disproportionate to the violations alleged to\n                     have been committed by the petitioner. The respondent could not have\n                     arbitrarily resorted to the extreme and harsh step of debarring the petitioner as\n                     a punishment in the ordinary course of business, considering that the act of\n                     debarment was, in effect, an act of blacklisting - which has serious\n                     consequences. It was submitted that the cancellation of the contract awarded\n                     in the petitioner&#x27;s favour had caused it significant financial losses and\n                     damaged its reputation, which was only likely to increase in the aftermath of\n                     the blacklisting. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"115323280\" id=\"span_67\">In this regard, reliance was placed on the decision of the\n                     Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/115323280/\" id=\"a_7\">Kulja Industries Limited Vs. Chief Gen. Manager</a> (2014)\n                     14 SCC 731 to contend that the decision of the respondent to blacklist the\n                     petitioner had to withstand the test of fairness, natural justice, relevance, non-\n                     discrimination, quality and proportionality. Yet, the entire premise of the\n                     impugned order was an erroneous assumption that the petitioner, while\n                     submitting its bid to the respondent in November 2019, had malafidely\n                     chosen to not inform the respondent about the price quoted by it for the\n                     equipment ordered by the NCI, without considering the admitted position that\n                     the contract with the NCI was executed only in March 2020. It was ultimately\n                     urged that, given the petitioner&#x27;s reliable brand name in the field of supplying\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                  Page 14 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">13:34:29</span>\n                      medical devices for decades, its past record of having satisfactorily serviced\n                     the respondent under previous contracts with no complaint of any\n                     wrongdoing, and its inability to reveal details of a contract which did not\n                     exist in November 2019, the decision to blacklist the petitioner was clearly\n                     disproportionate and unwarranted. It was prayed that the impugned order be\n                     quashed and set aside for the aforesaid reasons.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">                     14.   Per contra, learned Solicitor General submitted that the decision to\n                     blacklist the petitioner arose after a careful deliberation upon the facts of this\n                     case. It was submitted that at the time of personal hearing before the\n                     respondent&#x27;s Committee, the petitioner did not plead that the terms and\n                     conditions of the contracts executed between the NCI and the petitioner on\n                     the one hand, and the petitioner and the respondent on the other hand, were\n                     incomparable. It was further submitted that the respondent, after executing\n                     the supply order in favour of the petitioner on 27.03.2021, later found out that\n                     the petitioner had participated in the tender process with unclean hands since\n                     it had failed to disclose material information regarding its previous business\n                     arrangement with other hospitals in respect of the very same equipment. The\n                     terms and conditions of the TED showed that the respondent wanted all\n                     bidders to ensure the highest standards of ethics at the stage of procurement\n                     of the order and its execution and to that end, required certain disclosures\n                     from them at the time of bid submission. For instance, the Qualification\n                     Criteria in Section VIII of the TED made it incumbent on all bidders to\n                     meticulously disclose the names of the firms and details of orders specified in\n                     Proforma &#x27;A&#x27;, titled Proforma for Performance Statement, wherein similar\n                     equipment meeting major parameters of technical specification had been\n                     supplied and installed in the last five years. Given that the TED sought\n                     supply of Combined Single Generators for Ultrasonic Cutting and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                  Page 15 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">13:34:29</span>\n                      Coagulation device with advance Radio-Frequency Energy, the petitioner\n                     was required to submit a disclosure as per the format in Proforma &#x27;A&#x27;, which\n                     contained details of other orders for supply of the same equipment, that had\n                     been executed in the five preceding years. Ideally, the petitioner ought to\n                     have provided details of more recent orders that had been placed for the same\n                     equipment, such as the ones executed with the NCI in 2020 and CRHP,\n                     Ballabgarh in 2018 while submitting its bid. Instead, the petitioner filled the\n                     disclosure form with details of an order that was placed as far back as in 2012\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                     - that quoted relatively higher prices for the equipment. It was contended that\n                     even if the petitioner&#x27;s plea that it could not disclose the prices quoted to the\n                     NCI in November 2019 at the time of bid submission since the contract with\n                     the NCI had not been executed by then were to be believed, there is still no\n                     explanation as to why the petitioner did not disclose the same at the time of\n                     appearing for price negotiations before the respondent&#x27;s Price Negotiation\n                     Committee in March 2021, even though the contract with the NCI had been\n                     admittedly executed in March 2020 itself. The fact that the possibility of such\n                     a disclosure had not been conceived by the petitioner cannot be believed\n                     since it was at the time of price negotiations that it had furnished to the\n                     respondent other contracts that it had executed with the CRHP, Ballabgarh\n                     and AIIMS Emergency in respect of the equipment. It was submitted that the\n                     intent behind seeking such mandatory disclosures of past price quotations\n                     was to ensure that the respondent could purchase the equipment at the best\n                     market price, which meant that the respondent did not have a free hand to\n                     pick and choose which of its recently concluded project ought to be disclosed\n                     to the respondent. Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the petitioner, while\n                     submitting its bid on 15.11.2019 and participating in price negotiations in\n                     March 2021 prior to finalizing the Supply Order, had willfully failed to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 16 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">13:34:29</span>\n                      disclose to the respondent details of its ongoing contracts with the NCI\n                     executed on 19.03.2020. It was urged that this omission was a calculated\n                     decision on the part of the petitioner to withhold from the respondent that it\n                     had quoted lesser prices for the equipment in previous, more recently\n                     executed contracts. It was further urged that, by committing such an\n                     omission, the petitioner was guilty of &#x27;fraudulent practices&#x27; under Clause\n                     48.1(a)(ii) contained in Section II of the TED to influence the procurement\n                     process or contract execution, to the detriment of the respondent by charging\n                     it much higher prices for the same equipment. It was submitted, by delving\n                     into the purpose of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision and emphasizing upon the use\n                     of the term &#x27;identical product&#x27; therein, that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; is a price safety\n                     mechanism which provides that, if the contract holder reduces its price or is\n                     selling identical goods at a lower price to any person or organization during\n                     currency of the contract with the respondent, the contract price would be\n                     automatically reduced with effect from that date for all the subsequent\n                     supplies under the contract and the contract in question shall stand amended\n                     accordingly. It was contended that there was absolutely no merit in the\n                     petitioner&#x27;s contention that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; would have come into play only\n                     after execution of the contracts dated 27.03.2021 as the said provision was\n                     fully applicable to any sale during the currency of the respondent&#x27;s supply\n                     order, which was valid for a period of one year and, thus, brought existing\n                     contractual arrangements with CRHP, Ballabgarh and the NCI, very much\n                     within the purview of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision. It was urged that by\n                     adopting such hyper-technical interpretation of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision,\n                     the petitioner was attempting to deflect any questions on the obvious\n                     omissions and misrepresentations it had indulged in, in order to mislead the\n                     respondent into executing the supply order.

It was then submitted that the impugned order, a speaking order, has\n                     been passed by the respondent by duly following the principles of fairness,\n                     non-discrimination, and natural justice since the petitioner had been served\n                     with a show cause notice, given time to file its reply thereto and provided\n                     with ample opportunities to present its case. Besides, the entire text of the\n                     undertaking under Proforma &#x27;A&#x27; clearly stated that in case any information\n                     furnished by the bidder was proved to be false or incorrect, the respondent\n                     would have the power to take any action, as deemed fit, against the erring\n                     bidder. Clause 48.1(c) of Section II of the TED also empowered the\n                     respondent to declare an erring bidder ineligible to be awarded a contract\n                     with it, either indefinitely or for a stated period of time, if the respondent\n                     determined that the erring bidder had engaged in corrupt or fraudulent\n                     practices in competing for, or in executing the contract. For these reasons, the\n                     debarment itself could not be deemed arbitrary or unforeseen. It was\n                     submitted that, at the time of negotiating with the respondent for the subject\n                     tender, since the petitioner already knew that it was offering the very same\n                     equipment to the NCI at much lesser prices, it was the petitioner&#x27;s duty to\n                     inform the respondent of this position. However, the petitioner had\n                     deliberately failed to do so with the selfish interest of bagging the contract,\n                     which concealment had been viewed seriously by the respondent. It was\n                     urged that the petitioner&#x27;s actions violated the respondent&#x27;s trust and rendered\n                     it guilty of &#x27;fraudulent practice&#x27; under Section 48 of the TED, leading to the\n                     passing of the impugned order. It was submitted that in any event, the order\n                     of debarment is not in respect of all private or public medical institutions or\n                     hospitals; all that it implied was that the respondent was not interested in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 18 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">13:34:29</span>\n                      doing any further business with the petitioner for a period of two years. It was\n                     finally urged that this Court could not sit as a Court of appeal over the\n                     decision of the respondent, especially since the decision was informed by the\n                     application of two clauses in the TED, which had been known and accepted\n                     by the petitioner at the time of submitting its bid. It was, however, always\n                     open for the petitioner, if it felt it had been wronged, to institute a suit against\n                     the respondent in order to seek damages for the alleged losses that had been\n                     caused to it on account of the impugned order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">                     16.

The existence of this arbitration clause is a matter of record and,\n                     undoubtedly, the respondent is not incorrect when it claims that it was open\n                     for the petitioner to seek arbitration in accordance therewith. At the same\n                     time, it is a settled position of law, as reiterated recently by the Supreme\n                     Court on 12.05.2021 in its decision in <a href=\"/doc/127571616/\" id=\"a_9\">Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission\n                     Corporation Ltd. &amp; Anr.

In these circumstances, given\n                     that the petitioner is essentially claiming that the impugned order debarring it\n                     for a period of two years is an infringement of its fundamental right under\n                     <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India to carry on trade and business,\n                     and the legal position that the presence of an arbitration clause does not\n                     prohibit this Court from examining this case to ascertain the veracity of this\n                     grievance, as also the significant fact that the respondent did not press this\n                     point any further while presenting its submissions, I am of the view that this\n                     issue need not detain the Court any further.

This list of requirements has to be read along with Section VII of the\n                     TED that set out the technical specifications for the twelve generators and the\n                     accessories ordered along with them. The petitioner was also provided with a\n                     format in Proforma &#x27;A&#x27; of Section VIII of the TED for a Performance\n                     Statement disclosing certain information about the previous orders it had\n                     executed in respect of supplying the equipment, including the value of the\n                     order, description of the equipment, date of delivery, and a certification that\n                     the equipment supplied had been satisfactorily functional for the entire period\n                     of its use. The Performance Statement concluded with a statement from the\n                     petitioner/bidder certifying the following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                            &quot;We hereby certify that the details of all orders received in last\n                            5 years of quoted equipment (including AIIMS, PGIMER,\n                            JIPMER, RML Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, Institute of\n                            National Importance) has been furnished.

As regards this statement, the petitioner has claimed that phrasing of\n                     the format in Proforma &#x27;A&#x27; of the TED did not make it necessary for the\n                     petitioner to reveal details pertaining to its contracts with the AIIMS\n                     Emergency and the CRHP, Ballabgarh, but that it chose to do so nevertheless\n                     when the petitioner met for price negotiation with the respondent&#x27;s\n                     Committee on 12.03.2021. The petitioner also claims that insofar as the\n                     contract with the NCI was concerned, the same was executed only on\n                     19.03.2020, much after the petitioner had submitted its bid to the respondent\n                     on 15.11.2019, which meant that at the time of bid submission, the contract\n                     with the respondent in question did not exist.

It is the petitioner&#x27;s case that the equipment sought under each of the\n                     four contracts, can be characterized under the head of capital, accessories and\n                     consumables. Relatively, while the respondent did requisition the most\n                     number of capital - being 12 generators, it only sought 48 accessories and\n                     consumables each, whereas the contract with the NCI sought 1320\n                     consumables. The petitioner claims that since in contracts of such nature,\n                     most of the revenue is generated from consumables, it is only when quoting\n                     prices for consumables that a bidder can secure a profit margin for itself.\n                     Thus, the number of consumables ordered plays a significant factor in\n                     determining the prices quoted, and if the quantity ordered thereof is large, the\n                     price quoted would see some reduction. It is, therefore, the petitioner&#x27;s case\n                     that since the number of consumables sought by the respondent were\n                     significantly less than that sought by the NCI, which made them completely\n                     different from each other and, therefore, prevented any comparison between\n                     them. On the other hand, the respondent has claimed that the concluding\n                     sentence of the Performance Statement made it very clear that the bidder was\n                     required to provide details of all the orders received in the last five years in\n                     respect of the quoted equipment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                     23.   Primarily, the petitioner&#x27;s contention is that the difference in the\n                     number of consumables meant that the contracts were completely different,\n                     which implies that it considers the quantity of the consumables ordered as a\n                     major parameter. In my view, this explanation offered by the petitioner has to\n                     be considered in the light of the admitted position that in all of the four\n                     contracts executed by the petitioner with the respondent, the NCI, AIIMS\n                     Emergency, and CRHP, Ballabgarh respectively, while the primary product\n                     being ordered was the Combined Single Generator with the Ultrasonic\n                     Cutting and Coagulation device, the remaining products are the accessories\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 24 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">13:34:29</span>\n                      and consumables required to operate the former. The product bearing Model\n                     Code CRT11 is a generator cart, FSW11 stands for the accompanying foot\n                     switch and cable, HGA11 is the adapter for ultrasonic and radiofrequency\n                     instruments like the generator, HP054 is a hand piece/transducer compatible\n                     with various hand instruments used in open and laproscopic surgeries of the\n                     kind to be carried out by the device, HARH36 refers to the ultrasonic probes\n                     whereas NSLG2C35A is an articulating tissue sealer. Since the quantities\n                     ordered of each of these accessories and consumables, in each case, did differ\n                     in significant quantities, the petitioner was not in the wrong to contend that\n                     there were major variations in these orders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                     24.   In the light of this position, it is necessary to consider whether the\n                     petitioner can be said to be guilty of having indulged in fraudulent practices,\n                     under Clause 48.1 of the TED which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                               &quot;H.

While the entire principle behind a provision like Clause 48 is to\n                     endorse the high standard of ethics that is expected to be shown by all\n                     bidders, the petitioner&#x27;s plea is that, being a penalty provision, the same\n                     needs to be strictly construed, keeping in view the plain language of the\n                     contract. It is, therefore, necessary to visit the facts of the present case,\n                     especially the terms and conditions of the TED, to ascertain whether the\n                     petitioner had violated any contractual obligations that invited the application\n                     of this penalty clause, at all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">                     26.    What emerges is that, firstly, at the time of bid submission on\n                     15.11.2019, the bidding process for the NCI was still at a nascent stage and\n                     was yet to culminate into a contract between that Hospital and the petitioner.\n                     Thus, the petitioner is right to contend that, when the contract with the NCI\n                     had not been executed when the bid was submitted on 15.11.2019, there was\n                     no question of furnishing details pertaining to it at that time. Secondly, it is\n                     undisputed that the petitioner had made a real and serious effort to bring the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                  Page 26 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">13:34:29</span>\n                      contracts executed with the AIIMS Emergency and CRHP, Ballabhgarh on\n                     record, by placing them for the consideration of the respondent at the time of\n                     price negotiations. Thirdly, the petitioner had already sent a price disclaimer\n                     letter to the respondent on 07.11.2019, stating that in the case of other\n                     Government Department/Institution or any other institution, it may have\n                     quoted lower prices for the equipment, than the prices it had quoted to the\n                     respondent, and that such decrease in prices was in accordance with the terms\n                     of sale and other conditions applicable during the pendency of such contract.\n                     Given these factors, it cannot be said that the conduct of the petitioner was\n                     not completely transparent or that it had failed to inform the respondent in\n                     advance about lower prices having been quoted in different contracts.\n                     Furthermore, the respondent has not seriously dispute the petitioner&#x27;s plea\n                     that, as per general practice, contractors supplying sophisticated medical\n                     technology, such as the petitioner, earn more money from the consumables\n                     that are sold. As a result, the price quotations made by the bidders are made\n                     by taking the quantity of consumables, forming part of the contract, to arrive\n                     at the optimum pricing arrangement for themselves and the customers. To put\n                     it plainly, in the case of orders seeking higher quantities of consumables,\n                     such as that of the NCI, the price of consumables would be decreased and, in\n                     cases such as the respondent&#x27;s where the number of consumables sought were\n                     less, the price of the consumables would see a relative increase. When this\n                     was already known to the respondent, I am of the view that it cannot be\n                     permitted to conduct a mere superficial comparison of the pricing of different\n                     tenders, without taking into consideration the different parameters contained\n                     therein, to force a contractually unspecified obligation upon the petitioner to\n                     reveal details of previous contracts at the time of conducting price\n                     negotiations. Finally, and most significantly, as already noted above, there is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                Page 27 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">13:34:29</span>\n                      absolutely no provision in the TED which makes it mandatory for the\n                     shortlisted bidder to disclose previous contracts at the stage of price\n                     negotiations. Therefore, I am of the view that in the absence of any such\n                     contractual obligation, it would be unreasonable to stretch the applicability of\n                     a penalty clause, being Clause 48 of the TED, to penalize the petitioner and\n                     hold it guilty thereunder of &#x27;corrupt and fraudulent practice&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                     27.   At the same time, I cannot lose sight of the fact that the spirit behind a\n                     provision such as Clause 48 of the TED is to secure the highest ethical\n                     standard from the contractor during the procurement and execution process.\n                     This was, after all, not a run-of-the-mill contract and, instead, dealt with the\n                     supply of highly complex and nuanced medical equipment that would be put\n                     to use by medical professionals for the benefit of the public. Considering that\n                     the respondent enjoys the trust and goodwill of millions of citizens, hailing\n                     from rural and urban settings alike, when it comes to receiving quality\n                     healthcare, the immense responsibility owed by the respondent Hospital to its\n                     patients cannot be downplayed. It is in this background that one can truly\n                     appreciate the effect and importance of a provision such as Clause 48 of the\n                     TED and the disclosures it sought from the contractors it intended to partner\n                     with. Being one such contractor and partner, the petitioner was subject to the\n                     same standards and expectations, and had a duty to discharge these roles\n                     earnestly, and with the utmost care.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">                     28.   Even if the petitioner was under the impression that the contract with\n                     the NCI, and the one executed with the respondent were unique, different,\n                     and incomparable, the petitioner had a chance to confer with the respondent\n                     on this aspect and seek a clarification thereupon from the Price Negotiation\n                     Committee. In fact, I may note that the reply sent by the petitioner to the\n                     show cause notice on 15.04.2021 shows that the petitioner also bore the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 28 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">13:34:29</span>\n                      impression in respect of the contracts executed with the AIIMS Emergency\n                     and CRHP, Ballabhgarh, and believed them to be incomparable with the\n                     contract executed with the respondent. Yet, this did not prevent the petitioner\n                     from furnishing these contracts for the perusal of the Price Negotiation\n                     Committee on 12.03.2021. Thus, even if there was no explicit contractual\n                     provision fastening an obligation upon the petitioner to make such a\n                     disclosure during price negotiations, the petitioner chose to exercise due\n                     caution in advance and reveal details of similar contracts to the respondent;\n                     this transparency, however, did not seem to be recreated in respect of the\n                     contract with the NCI. Ultimately, the equipment, being Combined Single\n                     Generator for Ultrasonic Cutting and Coagulation device with advance\n                     Radio-Frequency Energy, had been supplied to the NCI far more recently\n                     than the equipment supplied to the AIIMS Emergency, CRHP, Ballabhgarh\n                     or the Dr. B.R.A. Institute-Rotary Cancer Hospital, AIIMS, New Delhi on\n                     13.12.2012, and does lend some credence to the respondent&#x27;s grievance that\n                     the petitioner could not pick and choose which contracts to disclose at the\n                     time of negotiations. The petitioner&#x27;s decision to be selective with the\n                     information it furnished to respondent at the time of negotiations does betray\n                     the cavalier manner in which the petitioner discharged its solemn duties as a\n                     contractor for the respondent. I am, therefore, inclined to agree with the\n                     respondent that the petitioner&#x27;s conduct was not entirely fair to begin with. It\n                     also lends credence to the respondent&#x27;s apprehension to partner up with the\n                     petitioner, in view of the complete loss in trust between them once the\n                     respondent came to know that the petitioner had withheld important\n                     information from it in respect of the equipment. Moreover, this erosion of\n                     trust and the respondent&#x27;s anxieties as to whether the petitioner, being a\n                     company of worldwide repute, had honoured its responsibility to act in their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 29 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">13:34:29</span>\n                      mutual interest and for the general public good at the time of executing the\n                     contract between them, are material considerations and cannot simply be\n                     brushed aside. While the absence of any contractual violation is manifest, the\n                     apprehensions of the respondent have to be balanced in view of the fact that\n                     the actions of the petitioner were not completely above board and, given the\n                     numerous and deliberate omissions that it partook in, rather unfair. Thus,\n                     while holding that Clause 48.1(a) of the TED is not applicable to the facts of\n                     the present case, I am not inclined to set aside the decision of the respondent\n                     to cancel the contract executed under the supply order dated 27.03.2021.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">                     29.    This brings me to the second question raised in this petition, whether\n                     the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; contained in Clause 33 of the General Conditions of\n                     Contract contained in Section IV of the TED was applicable at all, in the light\n                     of the allegations existing against the petitioner. To truly understand this\n                     aspect, it may be apposite to extract hereinbelow the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; of the\n                     TED:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                               &quot;33. Fall Clause\n\n                               Fall clause is a price safety mechanism. The fall clause\n                               provides that if the contract holder reduces its price or sells\n                               or even offers to sell the contracted goods of identical\n                               specification and terms &amp; conditions to that of the contract,\n                               at a price lower than the contract price, to any person or\n                               organization during the currency of the Contract, the\n                               Contract price will be automatically reduced with effect\n                               from that date for all the subsequent supplies under the\n                               Contract and the contract amended accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">                     30.    The petitioner contended that the respondent has completely\n                     misinterpreted the terms of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; and, resultantly, erred in\n                     assessing whether the same could be invoked in the context of the petitioner&#x27;s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 30 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">13:34:29</span>\n                      case at all. The petitioner also contended that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; came into\n                     effect after the contract between the parties was executed under the Supply\n                     Order dated 27.03.2021, and was only a price safety mechanism that vested\n                     the respondent with a right to seek reduction in price quotation in case it\n                     found that the petitioner was supplying the same equipment to another party\n                     for lower prices. A careful examination of the provision in question shows\n                     that the petitioner was right to contend that the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision neither\n                     gave the respondent a right to terminate the contract, nor to debar the\n                     petitioner from participating in future contracts. Rather, I find that all that the\n                     &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision enabled the respondent to do was to seek reduction of\n                     prices, which the respondent admittedly never sought. Thus, for the\n                     respondent to take shelter under Clause 33 of Section IV of the TED to\n                     defend its decision to terminate the contract and debar the petitioner, would\n                     tantamount to permitting the respondent to forcibly stretch the limited\n                     contours of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision to change its character from a\n                     remedial provision to a penalty clause. This simply cannot be permitted in\n                     view of the narrow purpose of the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; and, for the aforesaid\n                     reasons, the impugned order insofar as it invokes the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27; provision\n                     of the TED to cancel the respondent&#x27;s contract with the petitioner, and then\n                     blacklist it, is set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                     31.    This brings me to the next question, whether the impugned order had\n                     been passed after duly considering the defense put forth by the petitioner.\n                     Administrative orders, such as the impugned order, require the Authority\n                     passing it to clearly set out the reasons as to why it arrived upon a decision to\n                     penalize an entity. This makes such administrative orders, and the manner in\n                     which they are written, of special interest to the affected party and the Courts\n                     that deal with their grievances. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438325\" id=\"span_154\">In <a href=\"/doc/438325/\" id=\"a_11\">Mekaster</a> (supra), a Coordinate Bench of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                   Page 31 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">13:34:29</span>\n                      this Court made the following observations:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                            &quot;DUTY TO GIVE REASONS:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438325\" id=\"span_160\">22.

In S.N. Mukherjee&#x27;s case (supra) the Supreme Court\n                            pointed out that if reasons are recorded it would enable the\n                            Supreme Court or the High Courts to effectively exercise the\n                            appellate or the supervisory power. Such orders passed are\n                            subject to judicial review; albeit on the limited grounds on\n                            which such judicial review is available. These grounds include\n                            observance of principle of natural justice, namely, proper\n                            hearing and decision by an unbiased person, taking into\n                            consideration the relevant factors and conversely excluding all\n                            irrelevant factors in the decision making process etc.\n                            Therefore, in order to appreciate as to whether there was\n                            proper application of mind to the contention raised by the\n                            noticee and those who are duly considered, it is not necessary\n                            to give reason. It is for this reason that in S.N. Mukherjee&#x27;s\n                            case(supra) the Court laid down some other considerations. In\n                            the background of the dicta laid down in the aforesaid\n                            judgment as well as other judgments and commentaries of\n                            celebrated authors on administrative law, following\n                            justifications can be enlisted in support of the proposition that\n                            there is a need to give reasons for administrative decisions:--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">                            A) It would guarantee consideration by the authority;\n                            B) It would introduce clarity in the decisions;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                Page 32 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">13:34:29</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                             C) It would minimise chances of arbitrariness in decision\n                            making in dicating that the authority has given due\n                            consideration to the points in controversy;\n                            D) A duty to give reasons entails a duty to rationalise the\n                            decision. Reasons, therefore, help to structure the exercise of\n                            discretion, and the necessity of explaining why a decision is\n                            reached;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                            E) Furnishing reasons satisfies an important desire on the part\n                            of the individual to know why a decision was reached\n                            (Lawrence Baxter, Administrative Law (1991 p. 228);\n                            F) Basic fairness requires that those in authority over others\n                            should tell them why they are subject to some liability or have\n                            been refused some benefit (De Smith, Woolf and Jowell,\n                            Judicial Review of Administrative Actions (1995 p. 459);\n                            G) Rationale criticism of a decision may only be made when\n                            the reasons for it are known. This subjects the administration\n                            to public scrutiny and it also provides an important basis for\n                            appeal or review;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                            H) If reasons are assigned, they can provide guidance to\n                            others on the administrator&#x27;s likely future decisions, and so\n                            deter applications which would be unsuccessful.\n                            I) It may also protect the body from unjustified challenges,\n                            because those adversely affected are more likely to accept a\n                            decision if they know why it has been taken.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1964183\" id=\"span_166\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1934515\" id=\"span_167\">24. Thus, the most impelling consideration for insistence\n                            upon disclosure of reasons in support of an order or decision\n                            is that it ensures proper application of mind, reduces the\n                            possibility of casualness and minimises whim and caprice, and\n                            thereby serves to provide legal protection to persons against\n                            arbitrary official conduct (See <a href=\"/doc/1934515/\" id=\"a_15\">Bhagat Raja v.

Another judicial rationale for requirement of reasons\n                            is that a person affected by an adverse order is entitled to\n                            know why the decision has gone against him or her. &#x27;The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                               Page 33 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">13:34:29</span>\n                             decision might be perfectly right, but the person against\n                            whom it was made was left with the real grievance that he\n                            was not told why the decision had been made&#x27; (See Poyser\n                            and Mills&#x27; Arbitration, [1964] 2 QB 467 at p. 467). The\n                            obligation to give reasons according to the decision of the\n                            Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1508507/\" id=\"a_17\">Siemens Engg. &amp; Mfg. Co. of India\n                            Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, AIR 1976 SC 1785 stems from the\n                            mandate of natural justice. The Court held that absence of\n                            reasons leads to denial of justice because &quot;the rule requiring\n                            reasons to be given in support of an order is, like the\n                            principle of audi alteram partem, a basic principle of natural\n                            justice which must inform every quasi-judicial process and\n                            this rule must be observed in its proper spirit and mere\n                            pretence of compliance with it would not satisfy the\n                            requirement of law&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1672252\" id=\"span_174\">These threads were picked up and given\n                            a further boost in <a href=\"/doc/1672252/\" id=\"a_18\">Organo Chemical Industries v.

There, the Court emphasised that\n                            one of the requirements of natural justice was &quot;spelling out\n                            reasons for the order made, in other words, a speaking order.\n                            The inscrutable face of the sphinx is ordinarily incongruous\n                            with a judicial or quasijudicial performance&quot;..</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1436113\" id=\"span_175\">26. The recording of such reasons is imperative not only\n                            when the administrative authority discharges quasi-judicial\n                            function but also it is a pure administrative function and the\n                            decision is visited by civil or evil consequences as far as\n                            affected party is concerned (See <a href=\"/doc/1436113/\" id=\"a_19\">Ramesh B.

Having said that it has now become an obligation to\n                            give reasons in support of an administrative order, we may\n                            hasten to add that what is needed is not a detailed or elaborate\n                            judgment, but a brief and pithy statement of reasons for the\n                            decision. The administrative authorities, after all, are not\n                            discharging the judicial function like that of a Court and,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                               Page 34 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">13:34:29</span>\n                             therefore, not required to write an order in the manner in\n                            which normally a judgment is written by a court of law. The\n                            reasons given by an authority need be no more than a concise\n                            statement of the way in which it arrives at the decision. Way\n                            back in the year 1996 the Supreme Court pointed out in <a href=\"/doc/115323280/\" id=\"a_20\">M.P.\n                            Industries</a>&#x27; case(supra) that &quot;when we insisted upon reasons,\n                            we do not prescribe any particular form or scale of the\n                            reasons. The extent and the nature of the reasons depend upon\n                            each case.&quot; What is essential is that the order must be a\n                            speaking order and must state the elements which had led to\n                            the decision and tell its own story and one is able to infer as\n                            to why the order was made. De Smith, Woolf and Jowell\n                            point out that the reasons must &quot;meet the substance of the\n                            principle arguments that the tribunal was required to\n                            consider.

Suffice it to say that the above extracted portion of the impugned order\n                     contains the only semblance of reasoning that was given by the respondent\n                     for imposing a penalty on the petitioner and it certainly leaves a lot to be\n                     desired. The first paragraph of the reasoning curtly disallows the detailed\n                     defense of the petitioner by making a brief reference to it and then stating that\n                     the same was rejected because the petitioner had accepted all terms and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 36 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">13:34:29</span>\n                      conditions under Section IX of the TED, including the &#x27;Fall Clause&#x27;\n                     provision. I do not see any rational nexus between the petitioner accepting the\n                     terms and conditions of the TED and, on that ground, being forced out of its\n                     contract with respondent without being properly informed of the provision\n                     which it was allegedly guilty of violating. Insofar as the application of\n                     &#x27;Corrupt and Fraudulent Practice&#x27; and the &#x27;Fall&#x27; Clauses are concerned, this\n                     Court has already found hereinabove that the respondent did not have a\n                     concrete basis for invoking either of them in the facts of the present case.\n                     Apart from the alleged breach of Clauses 33 and 48, which has already been\n                     set aside, I am of the view that the impugned order fails to set out any valid\n                     ground for the respondent to proceed against the petitioner. Given that the\n                     petitioner had provided the respondent with a 13-page long reply to the show\n                     cause notice setting out its case, at the very least, the respondent, being an\n                     instrumentality of the State under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, ought to\n                     have provided the petitioner with sufficient reason as to why its detailed\n                     defense was being rejected. However, I find that the impugned order neither\n                     discusses any of the petitioner&#x27;s explanations, nor provides a cogent basis for\n                     rejecting them. For instance, if it were the case of the respondent that the\n                     number of consumables ordered could not be construed as a major parameter\n                     insofar as orders in respect of Combined Single Generators for Ultrasonic\n                     Cutting and Coagulation device with advance RF Energy technology were\n                     concerned, it was incumbent on the respondent to state as much in its\n                     impugned order and give reasons for taking such a stance. In Rama Pandey\n                     (supra), the Court had briefly dealt with the difficulties of cryptic\n                     administrative orders imposing harsh punishments, by making the following\n                     observations:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                             &quot;10. The impugned order dated 15th April, 2009 is cryptic and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                Page 37 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">13:34:29</span>\n                               does not deal with the contentions and the pleas raised by the\n                              petitioner. It is the case of the petitioner that repeat episodes\n                              might have been submitted because of human error or mistake.\n                              The said contention has not been specifically taken into\n                              consideration and discussed. The impugned order quoted above\n                              only records the final conclusion without any discussion or\n                              reasons and assumedly rejects the pleas of the petitioner. The\n                              respondents were entitled to reject the contentions and the pleas\n                              of the petitioner but only after recording reasons for rejecting\n                              the same. The final decision or operative portion giving the\n                              final verdict is not a substitute for reasoning. A penal order\n                              should contain reason, albeit brief reasons may suffice. To this\n                              extent, therefore, the impugned order cannot be sustained and is\n                              arbitrary and contrary to law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">                     34.   The impugned order fails on all of these counts. It not only miserably\n                     fails to deal with the contentions and plea raised by the petitioner, it goes on\n                     to abruptly record the final conclusion of the respondent without providing\n                     any cogent reasoning therefore, in my view, the impugned order, lacking on\n                     this count, fails to qualify as a speaking order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">                     35.   This brings me to the final grievance of the petitioner as regards the\n                     impugned order; could the respondent, in the facts of the present case, debar\n                     the petitioner from participating in any of the tenders issued by the\n                     respondent for a period of two years w.e.f. 29.04.2021 and was this\n                     punishment proportionate to the wrongs alleged to have been committed by\n                     the petitioner. Although, learned Solicitor General urged that the impugned\n                     order was not a &#x27;blacklisting order&#x27; that sought to impact the petitioner&#x27;s\n                     commercial interests with other private or public medical institutions or\n                     hospitals, the fact remains that mere difference in nomenclature does not\n                     determine the effect or purpose of the impugned order.

A quick glance at the bottom of the impugned order also\n                     shows that a copy thereof had been distributed to the Chiefs of various\n                     centres within the respondent Hospital such as the CN Centre; Dr. RPC;\n                     JPNATC; CDER; NDDTC; Dr. BRA IRCH; NCI, Jhajjar and CRHP,\n                     Ballabhgarh, as also the Senior Stores Officer/Stores Officer/Assistant Stores\n                     Officer of all Centres/Hospitals of the respondent.

At the same time, the respondent, being a Government\n                     hospital, is an instrumentality of the State under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 39 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">13:34:29</span>\n                      of India and, keeping in view the settled legal position set out by the Supreme\n                     Court in Kulja Industries limited Vs.

Therefore, even if the relationship between the parties had been\n                     crystallised in the form of a contract, the decision of the respondent, a\n                     government hospital, to blacklist the petitioner for alleged violations of the\n                     contract ought to withstand the touchstone of fairness, relevance, natural\n                     justice, non-discrimination, equality and proportionality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"161840108\" id=\"span_207\">37.

Indisputably, the impugned orders blacklisting the petitioner\n                            have severe adverse consequences for the petitioner. It is not\n                            disputed that the petitioner is essentially involved in executing\n                            contracts for various PSUs and Government agencies. It is usual\n                            for all Government undertakings and PSUs to specify eligibility\n                            criteria that excludes any person who has been blacklisted by\n                            any other Government agency, from participating in contracts or\n                            for tendering for contracts with Government agencies.\n                            Undisputedly, the import of the impugned orders blacklisting the\n                            petitioner is that the petitioner would also be disabled from\n                            participating in bidding processes or entering into contracts with\n                            other PSUs and Government agencies. The magnitude of the\n                            punitive measure is further enhanced as the petitioner has three\n                            independent business verticals and the business of rendering\n                            marine support is a small fraction of the overall business of the\n                            petitioner. The impugned orders would not only affect the\n                            petitioner in conducting the business with regard to marine\n                            support but also disable the petitioner from executing contracts\n                            relating to its other business verticals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                            xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"743328\" id=\"span_215\">41.

Given the nature of\n                            such an order and the import thereof, it would be unreasonable\n                            and arbitrary to visit every contractor who is in breach of his\n                            contractual obligations with such consequences.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508507\" id=\"span_216\">In <a href=\"/doc/1508507/\" id=\"a_27\">Sarku Engineering Services</a> (supra), a Division Bench of the\n                            Bombay High Court considered the case of a contractor (the\n                            petitioner therein) who had been blacklisted on the allegation\n                            that it was responsible for major delay in execution of a contract\n                            entered into with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited\n                            (respondent no. 2 therein).

In the aforesaid context, the Bombay High\n                            Court had observed as under:--</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                                 &quot;58. We hasten to add that there could be a situation\n                                 wherein the inherent power of blacklisting or placing the\n                                 contractor on Holiday-list can be exercised and the\n                                 stipulations or the terms of the contract may not restrict or\n                                 fetter exercise of such power. Equally, the mere pendency\n                                 of legal proceedings cannot be a absolute bar for invoking\n                                 this inherent power or exercising it. However, there have\n                                 to be strong, independent and overwhelming materials to\n                                 resort to this power given the drastic consequences that an\n                                 order of blacklisting has on a contractor. The power to\n                                 blacklist cannot be resorted to when the grounds for the\n                                 same are only breach or violation of a term or condition of\n                                 a particular contract and when legal redress is available to\n                                 both parties. Else, for every breach or violation, though\n                                 there are legal modes of redress and which compensate\n                                 the party like respondent No. 2, it would resort to\n                                 blacklisting and by sometimes abandoning or scuttling the\n                                 pending legal proceedings.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">                            42. Plainly, if a contractor is to be visited with the punitive\n                            measure of blacklisting on account of an allegation that he has\n                            committed a breach of a contract, the nature of his conduct must\n                            be so deviant or aberrant so as to warrant such a punitive\n                            measure. A mere allegation of breach of contractual obligations\n                            that is disputed, per se, does not invite any such punitive action.\n                            In the present case, IOCL had relied upon the Blacklisting\n                            Guidelines in support of the impugned orders. In terms of\n                            paragraph 2.1(i) of the Blacklisting Guidelines, a party could be\n                            put on a holiday list if he had committed a breach of a contract.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">                                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"743328\" id=\"span_222\">38.   Essentially, what makes a decision to blacklist serious are the\n                     consequences that are borne from it, for the person in respect of whom it is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_223\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                Page 42 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_227\">13:34:29</span>\n                      passed. Not only does such a blacklisting order significantly dent the\n                     reputation and goodwill that the company enjoys in the market and may have\n                     spent years cultivating, it also deprives them from a level playing field in\n                     respect of future business opportunities. As was aptly put by the Supreme\n                     Court in <a href=\"/doc/743328/\" id=\"a_28\">Erusian Equipment &amp; Chemicals Ltd. Vs. State of W.B.</a> (1975) 1\n                     SCC 70, blacklisting is an &#x27;instrument of coercion&#x27; which has the effect of\n                     creating a disability. Usually, when participating in a tender, the bidder is\n                     required to furnish a statement undertaking that it has not been blacklisted by\n                     any institution so far and, if that is not the case, provide information of such\n                     blacklisting. This serves as a record of the bidder&#x27;s previous experience\n                     which gives the purchaser a fair picture of the bidder and the conduct\n                     expected from it. Therefore, while the debarment itself may not be permanent\n                     and may only remain effective for a limited, pre-determined period, its\n                     negative effect continues to plague the business of the debarred entity for a\n                     long period of time. As a result, it is viewed as a punishment so grave, that it\n                     must follow in the wake of an action that is equally grave.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">                     39.   This begs the question, does non-disclosure of the contract with the\n                     NCI warrant debarment of the petitioner from all hospitals and centres of the\n                     respondent for a period of two years, as directed under the impugned order?\n                     In the light of the discussion thus far, it is clear that while the conduct of the\n                     petitioner was to some extent marred with omissions and may not have been\n                     completely fair, the same was not in clear violation of the contract between\n                     the parties, seeing that there were no contractual provisions addressing the\n                     peculiar circumstances that arose in this case, nor can the petitioner&#x27;s\n                     omissions be characterized as being grave enough to have caused serious\n                     harm or financial losses to the respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">                     40.   On the other hand, the petitioner has already suffered enormous\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_228\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                  Page 43 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">13:34:29</span>\n                      financial losses as a result of having its tender with the respondent scrapped,\n                     which has only mushroomed in the aftermath of the impugned order. It needs\n                     to be noted that solely on the ground of the existence of the impugned\n                     debarment order, the petitioner&#x27;s bid submitted on 29.07.2021 was quickly\n                     declared non-responsive by Sawai Man Singh Hospital, Jaipur on 30.07.2021,\n                     in respect of the tender bearing NIB No. 1350 dated 28.04.2021. The\n                     petitioner has also placed on record a letter dated 29.07.2021 received from\n                     King George&#x27;s Medical University, Lucknow where the petitioner has\n                     participated in a tender as well, requesting for more details of the impugned\n                     order. Keeping in view that blacklisting orders involve consequences for the\n                     contractor leading to its civil death, the impugned order appears to be\n                     operating the same way for the petitioner and is exhibiting a domino effect,\n                     inasmuch as other government medical institutions/hospitals are now relying\n                     on the impugned blacklisting decision to bar the petitioner from participating\n                     in their tenders. In this manner, there is an imminent and grave threat to the\n                     remaining 67 tenders that the petitioner is presently engaged under, with\n                     other medical institutions, and, as per its own calculation, the petitioner\n                     apprehends a further potential loss of business of INR 200 crore on account\n                     of the impugned order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">                     41.   Now, the respondent is right to contend that the equipment was not\n                     routine, but was a specialized item that required high quality manufacturing\n                     and maintenance services. In goods of such nature which are used by medical\n                     professionals in the course of treatment and have a real time impact on the\n                     lives of persons, the petitioner was required to consistently maintain a high\n                     ethical standard and, to that end, had the solemn responsibility to ensure\n                     absolute transparency in respect of the equipment and to disclose all relevant\n                     information relating to it. Be that as it may, the respondent was free to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                Page 44 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">13:34:29</span>\n                      proceed under the contract and institute appropriate proceedings against the\n                     petitioner for breach thereof, instead of travelling beyond the contours thereof\n                     to fasten it with the rather harsh punishment of being blacklisted. The\n                     petitioner has already suffered the blacklisting and has had its bids rejected\n                     on that count, for about four months at this point.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                     42.   An equally important factor to be considered at this point is that when\n                     it comes to sophisticated, specialized equipment to be used by medical\n                     professionals, such as the one sought by the respondent in the tender in\n                     question, the number of manufacturers in the country are quite limited. It is\n                     also an admitted fact that amidst such limited competition, the petitioner\n                     happens to be a notable and well-regarded player in this business, and has\n                     executed numerous supply contracts for such medical equipment in the past,\n                     without any complaint.     In fact, the petitioner has been engaged by the\n                     respondent many times, with no allegations of fraudulent conduct, and has\n                     successfully rendered its services under all such contracts to the full\n                     satisfaction of the respondent. I cannot also lose sight of the fact that the\n                     impugned order is likely to adversely impact public healthcare facilities as\n                     well, considering that there are over 600 units of GENII/Harmonic, supplied\n                     by the petitioner, that are presently installed in several government\n                     institutions in the country and are being used to carry out approximately\n                     1,10,000 procedures annually. The impugned order blacklisting the petitioner\n                     is likely to have a negative effect on the fresh orders for consumables being\n                     placed with the petitioner, by its existing customers against these earlier\n                     orders. This, in the long run, may compromise the integrity of medical\n                     procedures conducted with the equipment supplied by the petitioner. Above\n                     all, if the debarment order were allowed to operate, it would be an albatross\n                     around the petitioner&#x27;s neck, singling it out and prejudicing its business from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">Signed By:GARIMA MADAN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">Location:            W.P.(C) 5989/2021                                 Page 45 of 46</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">Signing Date:26.08.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">13:34:29</span>\n                      crossing the minimum threshold in all tender processes of having an\n                     unblemished past experience of providing the services in question.
