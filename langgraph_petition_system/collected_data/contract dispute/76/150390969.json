In   such\n                          circumstance, as per Clause 12, the appellant was supposed to write to\n                          the Engineer Incharge for resolving the dispute. Pertinently,\n                          communication dated 29-8-2013 is addressed to the Staff Officer\n                          (Mining). Therefore, by no stretch of imagination, can it be said that the\n                          appellant availed the departmental remedy provided under Clause 12,\n                          before filing the writ petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">                                  14.
