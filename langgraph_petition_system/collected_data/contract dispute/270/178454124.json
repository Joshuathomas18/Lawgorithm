On      26.09.2005,           the\n\ndefendant/applicant had issued a notice inviting tender for\n\nProject Management Consultancy Services, for design and\n\n\n\nCS(OS)No.2340/2008                               Page 1 of 16\n engineering,         carrying       out   investigation    work,          basic\n\nengineering          with   cost     estimate,    statutory     approvals,\n\nprocurement assistance etc. and preparation of project\n\ncompletion            documents           for     implementation             of\n\nLPG/Propane/Butane                  Import/Export         Terminal           at\n\nEnnore(Tamil Nadu), on a lump sum turnkey basis. The bid\n\ndocuments consisted of two volumes.                   The first volume\n\ncontained instructions to bidders; forms of bid, bank\n\nguarantee and conditions of contract, etc. whereas the\n\nsecond volume consisted of scope of work and other project\n\nrequirements. On 1.9.2006, the defendant/applicant issued\n\na Letter of Intent to the plaintiff with respect to the aforesaid\n\ntender.     Pursuant thereto, a work order dated 3.10.2006\n\nwas issued to M/s.Triune Projects Pvt. Ltd., which was\n\nsubstituted by amended work order dated 25.1.2007 in the\n\nname of the plaintiff which had acquired the business of\n\nM/s.Triune Project Pvt. Ltd. Other terms and conditions of\n\nthe    work     order       dated    3.10.2006,    however,       remained\n\nunchanged.\n\n2.          The work order, inter alia, provided as under:-\n\n            &quot;All the tender documents including\n            N.I.T., your quotation, payment terms,\n            special terms and conditions of the\n\nCS(OS)No.2340/2008                                         Page 2 of 16\n             tender, general description of the works,\n            subsequent negotiations and all other\n            correspondences connected with the\n            tender, shall form a part of this contract\n            agreement.&quot;\n\n3.          The case of the applicant/defendant is that the\n\ndocuments referred in the work order as forming part of the\n\ncontract included the Format for Agreement of Project\n\nManagement Service, <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 31</a> of which provided as\n\nunder:-\n\n            &quot;<a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_4\">ARTICLE 31 :</a> ARBITRATION\n            The arbitration proceedings shall be in\n            accordance with OM No.3/5/93-PMA\n            dated    30/6/93,    Govt.   of   India,\n            Department of Public Enterprises, which\n            reads as follows:-\n\n            &quot;In the event of any dispute or difference\n            relating to the interpretation and\n            applications of the provisions of the\n            CONTRACTS, such dispute or difference\n            shall be referred by either pasty to the\n            arbitration of one of the Arbitrators in the\n            Department of Public Enterprises to be\n            nominated      by    the    Secretary     to\n            Government of India, incharge of Bureau\n            of Public Enterprises. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_5\">The Arbitration Act,\n            1940</a> shall not be applicable to the\n            arbitration under this clause, provided,\n            however, any party aggrieved by such\n            award may make a further reference for\n            setting aside or revision of the award to\n            the Law Secretary, Department of Legal\n            Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice,\n            Government of India. Upon such\n            reference, the dispute shall be decided\n            by the Law Secretary or the Special\n\nCS(OS)No.2340/2008                                  Page 3 of 16\n             Secretary/Additional Secretary when so\n            authorized by the Law Secretary, whose\n            decision shall bind the parties finally\n            and conclusively. The parties in the\n            dispute will share equally the cost of\n            Arbitration  as    intimated   by  the\n            Arbitrator.&quot;\n\n4.          The       contract       was       terminated       by      the\n\ndefendant/applicant vide its letter dated 12.8.2008 on the\n\nallegations of various breaches on the part of the plaintiff\n\nand claims are stated to have been raised by it against the\n\nplaintiff in this regard.\n\n5.          The case of the plaintiff is that the work was\n\ncompleted by it by December, 2006 except for soil testing\n\nwhich took another five months as clear site was not made\n\navailable by the defendant.            It is also claimed that the\n\ninvestigation works could start only in April, 2007 and\n\nreport was submitted to the defendant on 25.2.2007. It is\n\nfurther     alleged    that   vide    letter    dated   8.9.2007,       the\n\ndefendant issued instructions to the plaintiff to resume the\n\nwork on part-II of the project and extended the project\n\ncompletion schedule to April, 2009. Pursuant to that letter,\n\nthe plaintiff commenced work on part-II.                    However, on\n\n9.6.2008, the defendant asked the plaintiff to cancel the\n\ntender giving high cost estimate and non-incorporation of\n\nCS(OS)No.2340/2008                                       Page 4 of 16\n some of its comments as the reason for cancellation. The\n\nplaintiff, however, continued with the work till August, 2008\n\nwhen the PMC contract was terminated by the defendant on\n\n12.8.2008.           According to the plaintiff, it had submitted\n\ninvoice     amounting       to   Rs.2,15,17,485/-   for   the       work\n\nperformed till May, 2008 but the defendant released only a\n\nsum of Rs.37,60,119/- leaving a balance of Rs.77,57,366.\n\nIt is also alleged that a bank guarantee of Rs.52,35,000/-\n\nwhich the plaintiff had submitted to the defendant was also\n\nencashed.            The plaintiff has now claimed a sum of\n\nRs.1,79,92,366/- which comprises the balance amount\n\npayable to it, the amount of bank guarantee and an amount\n\nof Rs.50 lakhs as nominal damages.\n\n6.          The case of          the defendant/applicant in this\n\napplication is that since the suit pertains to subject matter\n\nof an arbitration agreement between the parties, the matter\n\nis required to be referred to arbitration.\n\n7.          It is stated in the reply that there are three\n\ndifferent clauses pertaining to arbitration, i.e. (a) 9.0.0.0 of\n\nC 154 - C - G -102 (sheet no.76 of 89 at page 105).                  (b)\n\n<a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 31</a> of C 154-C-G 109 (sheet no.23 of 24 at page\n\nno.188 to 189). (c) <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 34</a> of the draft contract agreement\n\nCS(OS)No.2340/2008                                   Page 5 of 16\n and all the clauses are at variance. It is alleged that since\n\nall the clauses are at variance and had not attained finality,\n\nin the absence of a valid arbitration clause, the dispute\n\ncannot be referred to arbitration.\n\n8.          In       Eastern   Coalfields   Limited    vs.      Sanjay\n\nTransport Agency and Another, (2009) 7 SCC 345, the\n\nagreement between the parties contained the following\n\nclause:-\n\n\n            &quot;ARBITRATION WITH REGARD TO THE\n            COMMERCIAL DISPUTES BETWEEN\n            THE PUBLIC SECTOR ENTERPRISES\n            INTER SE AND BETWEEN THE PUBLIC\n            SECTOR      ENTERPRISES     AND\n            GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.\n\n            In the event of any dispute of difference\n            relating to the interpretation and\n            application of the provisions of the\n            commercial terms of the contract such\n            dispute or difference shall be referred by\n            either party to the arbitration, to one of\n            the arbitrators in the Department of\n            Public Enterprises, to be nominated by\n            the Secretary to the Government of India\n            incharge of the BUREAU OF PUBLIC\n            ENTERPRISES. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_8\">The Arbitration Act, 1940</a>\n            shall not be applicable to the arbitration\n            under this clause. The award of the\n            arbitrator shall be binding upon the\n            parties to the dispute, provided however,\n            any party aggrieved by such award,\n            may make further reference for setting\n            aside or revision of the award to the Law\n            Secretary, Department of Legal Affairs,\n\nCS(OS)No.2340/2008                                    Page 6 of 16\n             Ministry of Law &amp; Justice, Government of\n            India. Upon such reference, the dispute\n            shall be decided by the Law Secretary or\n            the     Special      Secretary/Additional\n            Secretary when so authorised by the\n            Law Secretary, whose decision shall\n            bind the parties finally and conclusively.\n            The parties to the dispute will share\n            equally the cost of arbitration, as\n            intimated by the arbitrator.&quot;\n\n            Relying upon the above-referred clause, the High\n\nCourt referred the dispute which had arisen between the\n\nparties to the sole arbitration of a retired judge of the High\n\nCourt. Setting aside the order of the High Court, Supreme\n\nCourt, inter alia, held as under:-\n\n            &quot;The aforesaid clause No. 14 relates to\n            disputes of commercial nature arising\n            between the Public Sector Enterprises\n            inter se and between the Public Sector\n            Enterprises         and       Government\n            Departments. The text that follows also\n            makes the said position clear which\n            provides that after the award is given by\n            the arbitrator in the department of public\n            sector enterprises, reference for setting\n            aside or revision of the award is to be\n            made to the Law Secretary, Department\n            of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Law &amp;\n            Justice, Government of India. The said\n            clause,     therefore,    concerns     the\n            commercial disputes arising between the\n            Public Sector Enterprises inter se and\n            between       such     enterprises    and\n            Government Departments. The said\n            clause will have no application to an\n            agreement which is entered into between\n            the appellant and the respondents, one</pre>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">CS(OS)No.2340/2008                                 Page 7 of 16</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">             of whom is a private party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">9.          Since <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 31</a> of the Format for Agreement of\n\nProject Management Service is absolutely identical to clause\n\n14 of the agreement between the parties in the case of\n\nEastern Coalfields (supra), it must necessarily be held that\n\nsince one of the parties to the agreement is a private\n\ncompany, it can have no application to the agreement\n\nbetween them and, therefore, no reliance can be placed on\n\nthe aforesaid clause for referring the disputes between the\n\nparties to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">            It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the\n\ndefendant/applicant that in the case of Eastern Coal fields\n\n(supra), the heading of the arbitration clause indicated that\n\nit applied to disputes between the Public Sector Enterprises\n\ninter se and the Public Sector Enterprises and the\n\nGovernment Departments, but, no such heading has been\n\ngiven to clause 31 of the Format for Agreement of Project\n\nManagement Service.          In my view, the contention is\n\nmisconceived for two reasons. Firstly, the heading to <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_10\">Article\n\n31</a> of the Format for Agreement of Project Management\n\nService indicates that the arbitration shall be in accordance\n\nwith OM No.3/5/93-PMA dated 30.6.1993, Government of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CS(OS)No.2340/2008                             Page 8 of 16</span>\n India, Department of Public Enterprises and that OM,\n\nundisputedly, refers only to arbitration between Public\n\nSector     Enterprises     inter   se    and      the    Public         Sector\n\nEnterprises and Government of India. Secondly and more\n\nimportantly, the arbitration clause in that case being\n\nabsolutely identical to the arbitration clause contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 31</a>, the heading of the arbitration clause would not\n\nbe a material factor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">10.             However,    clause      9.0.1.0     of    the      general\n\nconditions of contract for Project Management Consultancy\n\nServices, which form part of the tender document, also\n\nprovides for arbitration and reads as under:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            9.0.1.0 Subject to the provisions of\n            Clauses 6.7.1.0, 6.7.2.0 and 9.0.2.0\n            hereof, any dispute arising out of a\n            Notified Claim of the CONSULTANT\n            included in the Final Bill of lie\n            CONSULTANT in accordance with the\n            provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0 hereof, if the\n            CONSULTANT has not opted for the\n            Alternative       Dispute       Resolution\n            Machinery referred to in Clause 9.1.1.0\n            hereof, and any dispute arising out of\n            any Claim(s) of the OWNER against the\n            CONSULTANT shall be referred to the\n            arbitration of a Sole Arbitrator selected\n            in accordance with the provisions of\n            Clause 9.0.1.1 hereof. It is specifically\n            agreed that the OWNER may prefer its\n            Claim(s) against the CONSULTANT as\n            counterclaim(s) if a Notified Claim of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CS(OS)No.2340/2008                                       Page 9 of 16</span>\n             CONSULTANT has been referred to\n            arbitration. The CONSULTANT shall not,\n            however, be entitled to raise as a set off\n            defence or counterclaim any claim which\n            is not a Notified Claim included in the\n            CONSULTANT&#x27;s Final Bill in accordance\n            with the provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0\n            hereof.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            9.0.1.1 The Sole Arbitrator referred to in\n            Clause 9.0.1.0 hereof shall be selected\n            by the CONSULTANT out of a panel of 3\n            (three) persons nominated by the\n            OWNER for the purpose of such\n            selection, and should the CONSULTANT\n            fail to select an arbitrator within 30\n            (thirty) days of the panel of names of\n            such nominees being furnished by the\n            OWNER for the purpose, the Sole\n            Arbitrator shall be selected by the\n            OWNER out of the said panel.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">11.         Since the work order issued by the defendant\n\ncompany        specifically   stipulated   that   all     the      tender\n\ndocuments including general terms and conditions of the\n\ntender shall form part of the contract agreement, it cannot\n\nbe disputed that the above-referred general terms and\n\nconditions of contract, including the arbitration clause\n\nreferred-above, form part of the contract between the\n\nparties.     Thus, there is an agreement clause between the\n\nparties and in terms of that clause, any dispute arising out\n\nof a notified claim of the plaintiff included in the final bill of\n\nthe plaintiff as also any dispute arising out of any claim of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(OS)No.2340/2008                                      Page 10 of 16</span>\n the defendants against the plaintiff as required to be\n\nreferred to the arbitration of a sole Arbitrator to be selected\n\nin accordance with the provisions of clause 9.0.1.1 since\n\nadmittedly the plaintiff has not opted for the alternative\n\ndispute resolution machinery referred to in clause 9.0.1.0\n\nand the provisions of clause 6.7.1.0, 6.7.2.0 and 9.0.2.0\n\nalso do not apply to the claim of the plaintiff.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">12.         An       analysis   of   <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_12\">Section   8</a>   of   Arbitration     &amp;\n\nConciliation Act would show that the following conditions\n\nare required to be satisfied before the Court can exercise its\n\npowers under this provision: (1) there should be an\n\narbitration agreement; (2) a party to the agreement should\n\nbring an action in the court against the other party; (3)\n\nsubject-matter of the action should be the same as the\n\nsubject-matter of the arbitration agreement; (4) the other\n\nparty should move the court for referring the parties to\n\narbitration before it submits his first statement on the\n\nsubstance of the dispute.              In my view, clause 9.0.1.0\n\nconstitutes an arbitration agreement between the parties.\n\nThe plaintiff before this Court is a party to the arbitration\n\nagreement; the defendant which is the other party to the\n\narbitration agreement has moved the Court for referring the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CS(OS)No.2340/2008                                      Page 11 of 16</span>\n disputes       between   the   parties   to   arbitration,      before\n\nsubmitting its first statement on the substance of the\n\ndispute and prima facie subject matter of the suit is the\n\nsame as the subject matter of the arbitration agreement.\n\nTherefore, all the conditions required for exercise of powers\n\nby the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8</a> of the Act stand fulfilled in\n\nthis case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">13.         It was contended by the learned counsel for the\n\nplaintiff that since the disputes subject matter of this suit,\n\ndo not arise out of a notified claim of the plaintiff included\n\nin the final bill submitted by it, the arbitration clause\n\nreferred-above does not apply to the suit claim.           As noted\n\nearlier, the case of the plaintiff is that it had submitted\n\ninvoices amounting to Rs.2,15,17,485/- for the work\n\nperformed till May, 2008 and a sum of Rs.77,57,366/- out\n\nof that amount is still due to it from the defendant.               It is\n\ndifficult to accept that the claim with respect to this amount\n\nis not covered under the above-referred arbitration clause.\n\nAdmittedly, the defendant has also raised claims against the\n\nplaintiff and presumably the amount of the bank guarantee\n\nof Rs.52,35,000/- has been encashed towards satisfaction\n\nof those claims of the defendant. In any case, it will be very\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CS(OS)No.2340/2008                                  Page 12 of 16</span>\n much open to the arbitrator to take a view on this aspect of\n\nthe matter and decide whether any or all the claims forming\n\nsubject matter of this suit are covered under the arbitration\n\nclause or not. <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 specifically confers power upon the arbitral\n\ntribunal to rule on its jurisdiction including ruling on any\n\nobjections with respect to the existence or validity of the\n\narbitration agreement.
