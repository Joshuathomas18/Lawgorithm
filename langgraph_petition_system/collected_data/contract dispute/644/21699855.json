The main contention on behalf of the company before us is\n                that even assuming that the Government had power under\n                Section 5 read with clause 12 of GO No. U-464 (LL)XXXVI-B-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">                257(LL)/1954, dated July 14, 1954, to implead the company as\n                a party, the main issue decided by the Tribunal was not referred\n                to it and the Tribunal could only decide the three matters of\n                dispute included in the order of reference of July 31, 1956.\n                Therefore, insofar as the Tribunal went beyond the three matters\n                of dispute specified in the reference and decided the question\n                whether the workmen concerned were in the employ of the\n                company or of the Contractors it was acting without jurisdiction\n                as this matter was never referred to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">                5. We are of opinion that this contention must prevail. As we\n                have already pointed out, there were four matters before the\n                Conciliation Board including the question of non-abolition of the\n                contract system. Further before the Conciliation Board not only\n                the Contractors but the company was also a party, for obviously\n                the question of non-abolition of the contract system would\n                necessitate the presence of the company as a a party to the\n                proceedings. When however the Government referred the\n                dispute to the Tribunal on July 31, it did not include the fourth\n                item which was before the Conciliation Board relating to the\n                non-abolition of the contract system among the matters in\n                dispute. It also did not include the company as one of the parties\n                to the dispute, for the reference order refers only to two parties\n                to the dispute, namely, the Contractors and their workmen. On\n                such a reference there could be no jurisdiction in the Tribunal to\n                decide the question whether these workmen were the workmen\n                of the company or of the Contractors, for such a question was\n                not referred to the Tribunal. It is true that on August 13, 1956,\n                the company was impleaded as a party to the dispute referred by\n                the notification of July 31; but the matters in dispute remained\n                unamended, and the question of non-abolition of the contract\n                system or the question whether these workmen were the\n                employees of the company in fact and in reality was not included\n                in the matters of dispute by amendment under the proviso to\n                <a href=\"/doc/185363/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 4</a> of the Act. In these circumstances it is immaterial to\n                consider whether the impleading of the company as a party on\n                August 13, 1956, was legal and valid or not. Assuming that it\n                was legal and valid, the fact remains that Issue 1 set out above\n                by us which is undoubtedly the crux of the question in this case\n                was not referred to the Tribunal at all and did not arise out of\n                the three matters of dispute specified in the reference order of\n                July 31, 1956. In these circumstances the order of the Tribunal\n                by which it held that these workmen were the workmen of the\n                company was beyond its jurisdiction. The entire order of the\n                Tribunal is directed against the company and must therefore be\n                set aside in whole as without jurisdiction and we need not\n                express any opinion on the merits. We therefore allow the appeal\n                and set aside the order of the Tribunal against the appellant. In\n                the circumstances we pass no order as to costs.&quot;</p><pre id=\"pre_8\">\n\nGauri Gaekwad\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">         ::: Uploaded on - 06/06/2023                           ::: Downloaded on - 07/06/2023 10:44:34 :::</span>\n                                                 44/87                                  LPA-337-2011.doc\n\n\n\n\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">                   Paragraphs 3, 5, 8 and 11 of Pottery Mazdoor Panchayat\n\n(Supra) read as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">                &quot;3.

Having heard a closely thought out argument made by Mr.\n                Gupta on behalf of the appellant, we are of the opinion that the\n                High Court is right in its view on the first question. The very\n                terms of the references show that the point of dispute between\n                the parties was not the fact of the closure of its business by the\n                respondent but the propriety and justification of the respondent&#x27;s\n                decision to close down the business. That is why the references\n                were expressed to say whether the proposed closure of the\n                business was proper and justified. In other words, by the\n                references, the Tribunals were not called upon by the\n                Government to adjudicate upon the question as to whether there\n                was in fact a closure of business or whether under the pretence\n                of closing the business the workers were locked out by the\n                management. The references being limited to the narrow\n                question as to whether the closure was proper and justified the\n                Tribunals by the very terms of the references, had no jurisdiction\n                to go behind the fact of closure and inquire into the question\n                whether the business was in fact closed down by the\n                management.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n23                Mr. Singhvi&#x27;s reliance on C.P.

In our opinion,\n                the Tribunal must, in any event, look to the pleadings of the\n                parties to find out the exact nature of the dispute, because in\n                most cases the order of reference is so cryptic that it is\n                impossible to cull out therefrom the various points about which\n                the parties were at variance leading to the trouble. In this case,\n                the order of reference was based on the report of the\n                Conciliation Officer and it was certainly open to the\n                Management to show that the dispute which had been referred\n\nGauri Gaekwad\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">         ::: Uploaded on - 06/06/2023                             ::: Downloaded on - 07/06/2023 10:44:34 :::</span>\n                                                 47/87                                LPA-337-2011.doc\n\n\n\n\n                was not an industrial dispute at all so as to attract jurisdiction\n                under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_34\">Industrial Disputes Act</a>.

In effect, that is why the Reference itself says - if\n\nthe contracts were sham and bogus, whether the demand of the workmen\n\nfor absorption in ONGC was legal and justified.

This, apart from being unfair to the workman, is\n                against the principles of rules governing the procedure to be\n                adopted by quasi-judicial Tribunal, against the grain of\n                adversary system and against the principles governing the\n                decision of a lis between the parties arrayed before a quasi-\n                Judicial Tribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n                   In the present case, there is no reference to any of these\n\ndocuments in the workers&#x27; Statement of Claim and hence, they cannot be\n\nplaced in evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">29                 Further, the evidence before the Court has to be considered in\n\nits entirety.

But the fact is that the original\n\nappointment by Contractors was continued by reason of interim orders of\n\nthis Court. The Tribunal totally ignores the fact that under <a href=\"/doc/1574478/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 30(2)</a> of\n\n\nGauri Gaekwad\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">         ::: Uploaded on - 06/06/2023                ::: Downloaded on - 07/06/2023 10:44:34 :::</span>\n                                         56/87                             LPA-337-2011.doc\n\n\n\n\nthe CLR Act, the principal employer is entitled to enter into a settlement\n\ndirectly with the contract labour. Therefore, there is no evidence to indicate\n\nfrom the workman&#x27;s side that the contract was sham and bogus. In fact, no\n\nevidence has been attempted to be led to prove that the contract between\n\nONCG and the Contractors prior to 1st April 1997 (prior to 1st April 1997\n\nbecause the Contractors were removed by then) was sham and bogus. None\n\nof the witnesses of Appellant have anywhere admitted that these workmen\n\nwere absorbed as regular employees. The consistent stand of Appellant&#x27;s\n\nwitnesses has been that these workmen were only treated as direct\n\nemployees and that is the correct approach as that is what the order dated\n\n20th January 1997 provide for, &quot;Till further orders, Respondent No.1 shall\n\ntreat the workmen..... as their direct employee.........&quot;.\n\n32               According to the Tribunal the abolition of the contract labour\n\nsystem demonstrates that the contract labours were in fact the workers of\n\nAppellant. This conclusion is legally unsustainable because, abolition of\n\ncontract labour system does not ipso facto make the erstwhile contract\n\nlabour direct workers of Appellant. The Tribunal concludes that the\n\nProvident Fund Inspector Gonsalves (M.W.3), who was produced as\n\nManagement&#x27;s witness, had admitted that the Provident Fund of the\n\nconcerned workers were deposited in the same Contributor Fund of ONGC.\n\nThis is factually inaccurate when compared to actual evidence of this\n\nwitness.

This Court, while\n                answering the issue canvassed was of the opinion that the\n                proper approach would be to ascertain whether there was\n                complete control and supervision by the appellant therein.

(Supra),\n\nwhether the contract labourers have become the employees of the principal\n\nemployer in course of time and whether the engagement and employment\n\nof labourers through a contractor is a mere camouflage and a smokescreen,\n\nas has been urged in this case, is a question of fact and has to be established\n\nby the contract labourers on the basis of the requisite material. Therefore,\n\nthe onus was on respondents to prove that the contract was a mere\n\ncamouflage or ruse and the workmen have become the employees of\n\nAppellant in course of time. Paragraph 7 of R.K. Panda and Ors. (Supra)\n\nreads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">                &quot;7. It is true that with the passage of time and purely with a view to\n                safeguard the interests of workers, many principal employers while\n                renewing the contracts have been insisting that the contractor or\n                the new contractor retains the old employees. In fact such a\n                condition is incorporated in the contract itself. However, such a\n                clause in the contract which is benevolently inserted in the contract\n                to protect the continuance of the source of livelihood of the\n                contract labour cannot by itself give rise to a right to regularisation\n                in the employment of the principal employer. Whether the contract\n                labourers have become the employees of the principal employer in\n                course of time and whether the engagement and employment of\n                labourers through a contractor is a mere camouflage and a\n                smokescreen, as has been urged in this case, is a question of fact\n                and has to be established by the contract labourers on the basis of\n                the requisite material. It is not possible for the High Court or this\n                Court, while exercising writ jurisdiction or jurisdiction under\n                <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 136</a> to decide such questions, only on the basis of the\n                affidavits. It need not be pointed out that in all such cases, the\n                labourers are initially employed and engaged by the Contractors.\n                As such at what point of time a direct link is established between\n                the contract labourers and the principal employer, eliminating the\n                contractor from the scene, is a matter which has to be established\n                on material produced before the court. Normally, the Labour Court\n                and the Industrial Tribunal, under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_64\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> are\n                the competent fora to adjudicate such disputes on the basis of the\n                oral and documentary evidence produced before them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_131\">Gauri Gaekwad\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">         ::: Uploaded on - 06/06/2023                               ::: Downloaded on - 07/06/2023 10:44:34 :::</span>\n                                          64/87                             LPA-337-2011.doc\n\n\n\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n38               As regards Mr. Singhvi&#x27;s submissions that there is evidence that\n\nthough the Contractors were changed every 1-3 years the workers remained\n\nthe same and gratuity was paid by ONGC and there is no evidence to\n\nsupport the fact that the gratuity was paid by ONGC only after 1997 are all\n\nnon-starters. In fact, Appellant&#x27;s witness S.R. Kurup (M.W.1), in his cross\n\nexamination actually states that he does not know how many contracts were\n\nentered into or the details of the contracts. In fact, he does not say\n\nanywhere, as submitted by Mr. Singhvi, that though the Contractors were\n\nchanged every 1-3 years the workers remained the same.\n\n39               On the issue of gratuity, Mr. Cama submitted that respondents\n\nhave for the first time in this Court sought to claim that since Appellant was\n\npaying the workers gratuity, it must be presumed that they had accepted\n\nthem as their direct employees. We agree with Mr. Cama that this has not\n\nbeen part of the pleadings or any evidence. Mr. Cama also submitted that\n\nAppellant has never paid the gratuity of any workmen who retired prior to\n\ninterim order dated 1st April 1997. The onus would be on Respondents to\n\nprove otherwise. As regards employees who retired after 1 st April 1997,\n\nMr. Cama stated Appellant had initially refused to make the payments and\n\nthe workers complained to the Controlling Authority under the <a href=\"/doc/553799/\" id=\"a_65\">Payment of\n\nGratuity Act</a> and the application was allowed.

These petitions,\n\nMr. Cama submitted, are still pending. At the same time, Mr. Cama\n\nsubmitted that as the Contractors have been removed pursuant to the orders\n\npassed by this Court after 1st April 1997 just because Appellant paid them on\n\nhumanitarian consideration so that the workmen are not left without\n\ngratuity in their old age cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be concluded\n\nthat Appellant has accepted these workmen as their employees. We would\n\nagree with Mr. Cama. In fact, in R.K. Panda and Ors. (Supra), the Court has\n\nheld that mere fact of continuity of service would not be decisive.\n\n40               Mr. Singhvi&#x27;s submission that complete control and supervision\n\nwas with Appellant as the contractor only visited once a month or the MOUs\n\nwere signed with contract workers without the Contractors shows the extent\n\nof control of Appellant over the terms and conditions of service of their\n\nservice do not appeal to us. Certainly, if someone is working in an\n\norganization like Appellant, the organization will have some control and\n\nsupervision over the workmen at the least to the extent that the workmen\n\ndo not create any disastrous situation in the place of work.

It is, thus, evident that by taking recourse to an amendment\n                made in the pleading, the party cannot be permitted to go\n                beyond his admission. The principle would be applied in an\n                industrial adjudication having regard to the nature of the\n                reference made by the Appropriate Government as also in view\n                of the fact that an industrial adjudicator derives his jurisdiction\n                from the reference only. There is another aspect of the matter\n                which should also not be lost sight of. For the purpose of\n                exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 10</a> of the 1970 Act, the\n                appropriate Government is required to apply its mind. Its order\n                may be an administrative one but the same would not be\n                beyond the pale of judicial review. It must, therefore, apply its\n                mind before making a reference on the basis of the materials\n                placed before it by the workmen and/or management, as the\n                case may be, While doing so, it may be inappropriate for the\n                same authority on the basis of the materials that a notification\n                under <a href=\"/doc/1869167/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 10(1)(d)</a> of the 1947 Act be issued, although it\n                stands judicially determined that the workmen were employed\n                by the contractor. The State exercises administrative power both\n                in relation to abolition of contract labour in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 10</a>\n                of the 1970 Act as also in relation to making a reference for\n                industrial adjudication to a Labour Court or a Tribunal under\n                <a href=\"/doc/1869167/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 10(1)(d)</a> of the 1947 Act. While issuing a notification\n                under the 1970 Act, the State would have to proceed on the\n                basis that the principal employer had appointed Contractors and\n                such appointments are valid in law, but while referring a dispute\n                for industrial adjudication, validity of appointment of the\n                contractor would itself be an issue as the State must prima facie\n                satisfy itself that there exists a dispute as to whether the\n                workmen are in fact not employed by the contractor but by the\n                management.

The\n                equality clause contained in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_90\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_91\">16</a> should be\n                scrupulously followed and courts should not issue a direction for\n                regularization of services of an employee which would be\n                violative of constitutional scheme. While something that is\n                irregular for want of compliance with one of the elements in the\n                process of selection which does not go to the root of the process,\n                can be regularized, back door entries, appointments contrary to\n                the constitutional scheme and/or appointment of ineligible\n                candidates cannot be regularized.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">                (ii) Mere continuation of service by an temporary or ad hoc or\n                daily-wage employee, under cover of some interim orders of the\n                court, would not confer upon him any right to be absorbed into\n                service, as such service would be `litigious employment&#x27;. Even\n                temporary, ad hoc or daily- wage service for a long number of\n                years, let alone service for one or two years, will not entitle such\n                employee to claim regularization, if he is not working against a\n                sanctioned post. Sympathy and sentiment cannot be grounds for\n                passing any order of regularization in the absence of a legal\n                right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">                (iii) Even where a scheme is formulated for regularization with\n                a cut off date (that is a scheme providing that persons who had\n                put in a specified number of years of service and continuing in\n                employment as on the cut off date), it is not possible to others\n                who were appointed subsequent to the cut off date, to claim or\n                contend that the scheme should be applied to them by\n                extending the cut off date or seek a direction for framing of\n                fresh schemes providing for successive cut off dates.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">                (iv) Part-time employees are not entitled to seek regularization\n                as they are not working against any sanctioned posts.

This\n\nstatement is of no assistance to respondents because during the pendency of\n\nthis appeal, an application was taken out for early hearing of this appeal at\n\nwhich time the workmen - Union, expressed apprehension that Appellant\n\nhas advertised for 185 posts and if that was allowed to be filled in, they\n\nwould be rendered remediless. In that background, the statement was made\n\nGauri Gaekwad\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">         ::: Uploaded on - 06/06/2023                           ::: Downloaded on - 07/06/2023 10:44:34 :::</span>\n                                                75/87                                 LPA-337-2011.doc\n\n\n\n\nthat the vacancies will not be filled up.

This has been reiterated in Mahatma\n\nPhule Agricultural University &amp; Ors V/s. Nashik Zilla Sheth Kamgar Union &amp;\n\nOrs.29 where the Court held that when there were no sanctioned posts\n\navailable to absorb all the workmen, the status of permanency cannot be\n\ngranted when there are no posts. So also in Daya Lal &amp; Ors. (Supra).\n\n49                We also find support for this view in Vibhuti Shankar Pandey\n\n(Supra) where paragraph 3 of the said judgment reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">                &quot;3. The case of the appellant is that he was engaged in 1980 as\n                a Supervisor, on daily rated basis, under a project of the State\n                Water Resources Department of Madhya Pradesh. The appellant\n                sought regularization on the post of Supervisor/Time Keeper.\n                Admittedly, the minimum qualification for the said post was\n                matriculation with mathematics; a qualification which the\n                appellant did not possess. These qualifications were relaxed by a\n                Government Circular dated 31.12.2010 and the appellant\n                sought his regularization on the post of Supervisor/Time Keeper,\n                as he was qualified for the post and had been working on daily\n                wage basis for a long period of time. In fact, in another writ\n                petition (W.P. 13997/2010) filed by the appellant earlier, the\n                High Court of Madhya Pradesh vide order dated 02.11.2017,\n                had given directions to the State Government to decide the\n                claim of the writ petitioner in accordance with law. Vide order\n                dated 18.06.2018 issued by the Office of Chief Engineer, Rani\n                Avanti Bai Lodhi Sagar Project, the claim of the appellant for\n                regularization was rejected for the reasons that though the\n                minimum qualifications of matriculation with mathematics will\n                not come in the way for his regularization, but the fact remains\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">29.

The appellant on the other hand, had set his\n                claim for regularization as persons who were junior to him as\n                daily wagers were regularized in the year 1990 or even before.\n                The learned Single Judge while allowing the writ petition gave\n                directions for regularization of the appellant from the date on\n                which his juniors were regularized. This order was challenged\n                by the State Government before a Division Bench which allowed\n                the appeal of the State Government. The Division Bench rightly\n                held that the learned Single Judge has not followed the\n                principle of law as given by this Court in Secretary, State of\n                Karnataka and Ors.

While directing that appointments, temporary or casual, be\n                regularized or made permanent, courts are swayed by the fact\n                that the concerned person has worked for some time and in\n                some cases for a considerable length of time. It is not as if the\n                person who accepts an engagement either temporary or casual\n                in nature, is not aware of the nature of his employment. He\n                accepts the employment with eyes open. It may be true that he\n                is not in a position to bargain -- not at arms length -- since he\n                might have been searching for some employment so as to eke\n                out his livelihood and accepts whatever he gets. But on that\n                ground alone, it would not be appropriate to jettison the\n                constitutional scheme of appointment and to take the view that\n                a person who has temporarily or casually got employed should\n                be directed to be continued permanently. By doing so, it will be\n                creating another mode of public appointment which is not\n                permissible. If the court were to void a contractual employment\n                of this nature on the ground that the parties were not having\n                equal bargaining power, that too would not enable the court to\n                grant any relief to that employee. A total embargo on such\n                casual or temporary employment is not possible, given the\n                exigencies of administration and if imposed, would only mean\n                that some people who at least get employment temporarily,\n                contractually or casually, would not be getting even that\n                employment when securing of such employment brings at least\n                some succor to them. After all, innumerable citizens of our vast\n                country are in search of employment and one is not compelled\n                to accept a casual or temporary employment if one is not\n                inclined to go in for such an employment. It is in that context\n                that one has to proceed on the basis that the employment was\n                accepted fully knowing the nature of it and the consequences\n                flowing from it. In other words, even while accepting the\n                employment, the person concerned knows the nature of his\n                employment. It is not an appointment to a post in the real sense\n                of the term. The claim acquired by him in the post in which he is\n                temporarily employed or the interest in that post cannot be\n                considered to be of such a magnitude as to enable the giving up\n                of the procedure established, for making regular appointments\n                to available posts in the services of the State. The argument that\n                since one has been working for some time in the post, it will not\n                be just to discontinue him, even though he was aware of the\n                nature of the employment when he first took it up, is not one\n                that would enable the jettisoning of the procedure established\n                by law for public employment and would have to fail when\n                tested on the touchstone of constitutionality and equality of\n                opportunity enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_11\">\n\nGauri Gaekwad\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">         ::: Uploaded on - 06/06/2023                           ::: Downloaded on - 07/06/2023 10:44:34 :::</span>\n                                                 79/87                                LPA-337-2011.doc\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">                46.

The\n                very engagement was against the constitutional scheme.\n                Though, the Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes\n                Department sought to get the appointments made permanent,\n                there is no case that at the time of appointment any promise\n                was held out. No such promise could also have been held out in\n                view of the circulars and directives issued by the Government\n                after the Dharwad decision. Though, there is a case that the\n                State had made regularizations in the past of similarly situated\n                employees, the fact remains that such regularizations were done\n                only pursuant to judicial directions, either of the Administrative\n                Tribunal or of the High Court and in some case by this Court.\n                Moreover, the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate\n                expectation cannot enable the employees to claim that they\n                must be made permanent or they must be regularized in the\n                service though they had not been selected in terms of the rules\n                for appointment. The fact that in certain cases the court had\n                directed regularization of the employees involved in those cases\n                cannot be made use of to found a claim based on legitimate\n                expectation. The argument if accepted would also run counter\n                to the constitutional mandate. The argument in that behalf has\n                therefore to be rejected.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">                47.

One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where\n                irregular appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained\n                in S.V. Narayanappa, R.N. Nanjundappa and B.N. Nagarajan and\n                referred to in paragraph 15 above, of duly qualified persons in\n                duly sanctioned vacant posts might have been made and the\n                employees have continued to work for ten years or more but\n                without the intervention of orders of courts or of tribunals. The\n                question of regularization of the services of such employees may\n                have to be considered on merits in the light of the principles\n                settled by this Court in the cases above referred to and in the\n                light of this judgment. In that context, the Union of India, the\n                State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps\n                to regularize as a one time measure, the services of such\n                irregularly appointed, who have worked for ten years or more in\n                duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of orders of courts or\n                of tribunals and should further ensure that regular recruitments\n                are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require\n                to be filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily\n                wagers are being now employed. The process must be set in\n                motion within six months from this date. We also clarify that\n                regularization, if any already made, but not subjudice, need not\n                be reopened based on this judgment, but there should be no\n                further by-passing of the constitutional requirement and\n                regularizing or making permanent, those not duly appointed as\n                per the constitutional scheme.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">                                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n51                The fact that mere long service confers no right on illegally\n\nappointed workmen has been further clarified as late as in the judgment of\n\nthe Apex Court in Chief Executive Officer, Zila Parishad, Thane &amp; Ors.
