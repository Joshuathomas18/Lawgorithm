After finalization of registration the respondent Lucknow Development Authority informed the petitioner vide letter dated 25.6.2007 that she has been allotted L.I.G. &quot;D&quot; type house measuring 38.30 Sq. meter duplex deluxe house, bearing No.- E-4/563/Sector &quot;O&quot; Mansarovar Yojana, Kanpur Road, Lucknow.    Being self finance scheme and on demand by the Lucknow Development Authority, the petitioner has further deposited amounting to rupees 67,500/- ,42,188,  3,00,000/- and 1,657/-, at certain intervals and after depositing the above mentioned amount, a request was made to the respondents to execute the sale deed in her favour.  Vide a communication dated 6.7.2011, the petitioner was informed that the Yojana in question and specifically house allotted to the petitioner is under dispute with the Defence Department and as such either the petitioner may wait for resolving the dispute or may get back money deposited with interest, in accordance with existing Rules.  In reply thereof the petitioner requested to the opposite parties to accommodate in any other scheme.  In response thereof she was communicated to get a flat in Sun Rise Apartment on the new terms and conditions with enhanced rate of property.  Though the petitioner was informed verbally to wait for resolving of the dispute with the Defence Department but vide letter dated 31.7.2012 she was informed to get back her money by 31.8.2012 failing which it will be presumed that the petitioner want to wait for resolving of the dispute with the Defence Department.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.\t\tBy submitting counter affidavit, respondent no.-2 has submitted that previously the petitioner was allotted residential accommodation No.-  E-4/563/Sector &quot;O&quot; Mansarovar Yojana, Kanpur Road, Lucknow, but due to dispute with the defence department and on request of the petitioner, the petitioner was allotted House No.-4/510 in Sector O,  Mansarovar Yojana, Kanpur Road, Lucknow by adjusting the previous amount deposited for allotment of House No.- E-4/563/Sector &quot;O&quot; Mansarovar Yojana, Kanpur Road, Lucknow.  By filing separate counter affidavit respondent nos.- 2 to 4 has submitted that the petitioner was informed through the costing letter dispatched to her on 22.11.2014 in order to deposit the required amount to be deposited against the allotment of new house admeasuring  52.66 Sq. Meter.  The rest of the amount which was required to be paid against the allotment of new residence has not been deposited by the petitioner on the ground that she has already deposited the amount of previous accommodation.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.\t\tIt has been submitted by learned Counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has deposited the total amount which was required at the time of, allotment of first residential accommodation in  Mansarovar Yojana, but due to dispute with the Defence Department, she was given choice for the second scheme for which she contended, but Lucknow Development Authority had demanded higher amount for which she cannot be compelled to deposit it.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">6.\t\tLearned Counsel for the respondent has submitted that the petitioner was previously allotted Duplex Delux House, admeasuring and estimated area 38.30 Sq. Meter and later on on the request of the petitioner she was accommodated in the new scheme and after organizing the lottery in which 36 allottees including the petitioner have been allotted the house admeasuring 52.66 Sq. Meter.   Through costing letter dated 22.11.2014, the petitioner was informed that the area of the house is 52.66 Sq. Meter and her earlier deposit amount of rupees 4,56,345/- was adjusted and balance of amount of rupees 1,96,840/- was to be deposited by 31.12.2014 failing which an additional penal interest @ 16% yearly compounded was to be charged by the petitioner.  The petitioner was further informed to deposit free hold charge, water, sewerage and other miscellaneous charges which are mandatory for every allottee.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.\t\t The petitioner has raised certain objections to the costing letter sent by the Lucknow Development Authority.  Since the area which has been allotted to the petitioner is excess than the previous allotted accommodation i.e. 14.36 Sq. Meter more than the previous allotment, she will have to pay the excess amount which have been calculated as per guidelines and rules made by the Government from time to time.  Again in reply to the communication of the petitioner she was informed vide letter dated 9.1.2015 to deposit rupees 2,02,295/- which she had to deposit by 28.2.2015 failing which she have to pay penal interest as per Rules.  The calculation of the amount was done in accordance with the guide lines issued by the State Government vide Government Order No.-4049/9-A-1-9A/16 Samiti/198 dated 20.3.1999.  In Clause 15 of the guidelines provides that the additional cost of 10% of the allotted area and the calculation of the additional area at the current rate will be the criteria for calculation of the amount.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">8.\t\tThe respondent has also submitted the calculation chart maintained by the Lucknow Development Authority through which an amount of 2,02,295/- was payable by the petitioner on or before 28.2.2015 failing which the prevailing rate of interest shall be charged on the balance amount.  The petitioner has not paid the aforesaid amount till date.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">9.\t\tLearned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the respondent cannot charge the current rate upon the excess land allotted alongwith allotted house which is more than the area of the previous allotment.  It has further been submitted that they have to charge the price of land at the old rate as it was on June 2007 when the original allotment was made to the petitioner.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">10.\t\tLearned Counsel for the respondent has submitted that the purpose of the agreement with the petitioner became impossible or the agreement frustrated due to the reason that the previously vide gazette notification dated 17.12.1984 the area in question was acquired for planned development of Kanpur Road City Expansion Scheme Part-3, Lucknow and the award was declared by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Nagar Mahapalika.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">11.\t\tAfter completion of certain construction of houses in the said scheme the Defence Estate Department raised certain claims over 3.99 Acres of land and around 90 houses&#x27; construction work could not be taken place, due to which the petitioner was not allotted the said residence.  Even after intervention of State when the matter was not settled the petitioner has filed the petition before this Hon&#x27;ble Court and after intervention of the Court, Vice Chairman Lucknow Development Authority had constituted a six Members Committee headed by Additional Secretary, Lucknow Development Authority and after its meeting held in 26.6.2014, it was resolved that a lottery draw shall be organized to make an adjustment on disputed houses and it was published in two daily news papers.    36 allottees were adjusted in this scheme and the petitioner was successful and was communicated about the allotment/adjustment in the new scheme with further direction to pay the additional amount by stipulated date but the same has not been deposited till date. The reason of enhancement of the rate has been communicated to the petitioner with the calculation chart, which was based on 10% higher rate of old area and current rate of the additional land which has been allotted to the petitioner.  It is to be noted that previously the petitioner was allotted an area of 38.30 Sq. Meter,  whereas in the new allotment she was accommodated in the area of 52.66 Sq. Meter ( i.e. 14.36 excess area).  The new accommodation was alloted to the petitioner on the petitioner&#x27;s request and option.  Lucknow Development Authority vide letter dated 9.1.2015 has communicated to the petitioner about the allotment of new residence with communication about the payment of excess amount up to 28.2.2015 failing which the petitioner had to pay the penal interest.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">12.\t\tLearned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the Lucknow Development Authority is bound to allot or execute a sale deed of the new accommodation on the previous rate while the respondent had submitted that they have to calculate the cost of the area with construction in accordance with the Rules, Government Orders, applicable from time to time and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement.  The Brochure  under Clause 14.3 provides that in case the possession of the land was not possible or the sale deed is not executed in favour of the petitioner due to certain reasons the allottee will be entitled for the return of his/her deposited money but non execution of sale deed or non handing over the possession will not be the ground for filing any suit or petition in any Court.  Further Clause 14.7 provides that mere registration of the applicant does not entitle for allotment of the accommodation.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">13.\t\tLearned Counsel for the respondents has submitted that due to reason of dispute with the Defence Department the construction of house at that area became impossible and when the agreement or the contract becomes impossible or frustrated due to certain new circumstances one of the party is not bound to fulfill the condition.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"264553\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1944274\" id=\"span_2\">14.\t\tThe Court has to consider the scope and application of doctrine of &quot;lex non cogit at impossibilia&quot; (the law does not compel a man to do what he cannot possibly perform) and &quot;impossibilium nulla obligatio est&quot; (the law does not expect the party to do the impossible). The scope of the said doctrines have elaborately been considered and applied by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1944274/\" id=\"a_2\">Chandra Kishore Jha Vs. Mahaveer Prasad &amp; Ors.</a>, (1999) 8 SCC 266; and <a href=\"/doc/264553/\" id=\"a_3\">Mohammed Gazi Vs. State of M.P. &amp; Ors.</a>, (2000) 4 SCC 342. These maxims which have also been expressed as impotentia excusate lege must be  understood in the qualified sense that impotentia excuses when there is a necessary or invincible disability to perform the mandatory part of the law or to forbear the prohibitory. These maxims are akin to the maxim of Roman Law Nemo Tenetur ad Impossibilia (no one is bound to an impossibility) which is derived from common sense and natural equity and has been adopted and applied in law from time immemorial.</span></span> (Vide Eagar Vs. Furnivall, 17 Ch. D. 115).\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\tIn Gujarat Assembly Election Matter, (2002) 8 SCC 237, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court observed as under:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t&quot;The maxim of law impotentia excusat legem is intimately connected with another maxim of law lex non cogit ad impossibilia.  Impotentia excusat legem is that when there is a necessary or invincible disability to perform the mandatory part of the law that impotentia excuses. The law does not compel one to do that which one cannot possibly perform. Therefore, when it appears that the performance of the formalities prescribed by a statute has been rendered impossible by circumstances over which the persons interested had no control, like an act of God, the circumstances will be taken as a valid excuse.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\tThe law is understood to disclaim all intention of compelling to impossibilities and the administration of laws must adopt that general exception in the consideration of all particular cases. Therefore, there are implied obligations not to force a person to do something which is rendered impossible by causes beyond his control. (Vide Hick Vs.

The parameters of the Court&#x27;s power have been analyzed by the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay &amp; Ors,. Vs. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. &amp; Ors., AIR 1984 SC 1182. We reproduce paragraph-11 of the said judgment-:\n</p> \n\n \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"884550\" id=\"span_6\">&quot;By now, the parameters of the Court&#x27;s power of judicial review of administrative or executive action or decision and the grounds on which the Court can interfere with the same are well settled and it would be redundant to recapitulate the whole catena of decisions of this Court commencing from Barium Chemicals, 1966 Supp SCR 311: (AIR 1967 SC 295) case on the point. Indisputably, it is a settled position that if the action or decision is perverse or is such that no reasonable body of persons, properly informed, could come to, or has been arrived at by the authority misdirecting itself by adopting a wrong approach, or has been influenced by irrelevant or extraneous matters the Court would be justified in interfering with the same. This Court in one of its later decisions in <a href=\"/doc/884550/\" id=\"a_8\">Smt. Shalini Soni Vs. Union of India</a>, (1981) 1 SCR 962; (AIR 1981 SC 431), has observed thus: &quot;It is an unwritten rule of the law, constitutional and administrative, that whenever a decision-making function is entrusted to the subjective satisfaction of a statutory functionary, there is an implicit obligation to apply his mind to pertinent and proximate matters only, eschewing the irrelevant and the remote&quot;. Suffice it to say that the following passage appearing at pages 285-86 in Prof. de Smith&#x27;s treatise &#x27;&#x27;Judicial Review of Administrative Action&#x27; (4th Edn.) succinctly summarises the several principles formulated by the Courts in that behalf thus: &quot;The authority in which a discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In general, a discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed. That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it: it must not act under the dictation of another body or disable itself from exercising a discretion in each individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorised to do. It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations, must not be swayed by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. Nor where a judgment must be made that certain facts exist can a discretion be validly exercised on the basis of an erroneous assumption about those facts. These several principles can conveniently be grouped in two main categories; failure to exercise a discretion, and excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive. Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account; and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires. Nor, is it possible to differentiate with precision the grounds of invalidly contained within each category&quot;.</span>      \n</blockquote> \n\t       \t\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1901448\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/1901448/\" id=\"a_9\">State of U.P. &amp; Ors., Vs.

AIR 1988 SC 1737 it was held that exercise of administrative power will be set aside if there is a manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary.</span> \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">The famous &quot;Wednesbury Case&quot; Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. Us. Wednesbury Corp. (1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA) is considered to be the landmark in so far as the basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory direction are concerned. We quote a passage from the judgment of Lord Greene which is as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word &#x27;&#x27;unreasonable&#x27; in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters, which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters, which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting &#x27;&#x27;unreasonably&#x27;. Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers of the authority...... . In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith; and in fact, all these things run into one another.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\t\tThe principles of judicial review of administrative action were further summarized in 1985 by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions Vs. Minister for the Civil Service 1984 (3) Al. ER. 935, (commonly known as CCSU case) as illegality, procedural impropriety and irrationality. He said more grounds could in future become available, including the doctrine of proportionality which was a principle followed by certain other members of the European Economic Community. Lord Diplock observed in this case as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;....... Judicial review has I think, developed to a stage today when, without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call &#x27;&#x27;illegality&#x27;, the second &#x27;&#x27;irrationality&#x27; and the third &#x27;&#x27;procedural impropriety&#x27;. That is not to say that further development on a case-by-case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of &#x27;&#x27;proportionality&#x27; which is recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European Economic Community.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">Lord Diplock explained &#x27;&#x27;irrationality&#x27; as follows:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;By &#x27;&#x27;irrationality&#x27; I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as &#x27;&#x27;Wednesbury unreasonableness&#x27;.

Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the contract is reached by process of negotiations through several tiers.

The basic requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 14</a> is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heartbeat of fair play. Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review only to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason, not whimsically for any ulterior purpose. The meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely defined. A question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case.

What is necessary in order to pass the test of permissible classification under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 14</a> is that the classification must not be &quot;arbitrary, artificial or evasive&quot; but must be based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the legislature...........Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc. It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straight jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where, having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature. The Court should feel more inclined to give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved. ........The Court must always remember that &quot;legislation is directed to practical problems, that the economic mechanism is highly sensitive and complex, that many problems are singular and contingent, that laws are not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be measured by abstract symmetry&quot; that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are not always possible and that &quot;judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and uninterpreted experience&quot;. Every legislation particularly in economic matters is essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate all possible abuse. There may be crudities and inequities in complicated experimental economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot be struck down as invalid.............There may even be possibilities of abuse, but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the legislation, because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some divine prescience, distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses. Indeed, howsoever great may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is difficult to conceive of a legislation which is not capable of being abused by perverted human ingenuity. The Court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions. If any crudities, inequities or possibilities of abuse come to light, the legislature can always step in and enact suitable amendatory legislation. That is the essence of pragmatic approach which must guide and inspire the legislature in dealing with complex economic issues.

Vs. Wednesbury Corporation, (1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA) is considered to be a landmark in so far as the basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory actions are concerned. We quote a passage from the judgment of Lord Greene which is as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word &#x27;&#x27;unreasonable&#x27; in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters, which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters, which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting &#x27;&#x27;unreasonably&#x27;. Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers of the authority....... In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith; and in fact, all these things run into one another.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\tThe principles of judicial review of administrative action were further summarised in Council of Civil Service Unions Vs. Minister for the Civil Services 1984 (3) All. ER. 935, (commonly known as CCSU case) as &quot;illegality&quot;, &quot;procedural impropriety&quot; and &quot;irrationality&quot;. It was also observed that some more grounds could in future become available, including the &quot;doctrine of proportionality&quot; which was a principle followed by certain other members of the European Economic Community. Irrationality was explained as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107483\" id=\"span_39\">In <a href=\"/doc/107483/\" id=\"a_59\">Union of India &amp; Anr.

The reason is that whereas in cases where the decision is based on subjective satisfaction if some of the reasons turn out to be irrelevant or invalid, it would be impossible for a superior Court to find out which of the reasons, relevant or irrelevant, valid or invalid, had brought about such satisfaction. But in a case where the conclusion is based on objective facts and evidence, such a difficulty would not arise. If it is found that there was legal evidence before the Tribunal, even if some of it was irrelevant, a superior Court would not interfere if the finding can be sustained on the rest of the evidence.

Once a factual stand is taken, it cannot be changed on any legal proposition whatsoever nor it is permissible for the Court to examine the correctness of the findings of fact unless it is found to be perverse being based on no evidence or contrary to evidence, as the writ Court exercises its supervisory jurisdiction and not of appellate forum.

Learned counsel has rightly questioned the maintainability of the writ petition. The interpretation and implementation of a clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ petition. Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is a question of construction of contract. If a term of contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 226.</a> We are also unable to agree with the observations of the High Court that the contractor was seeking enforcement of a statutory contract. A contract would not become statutory simply because it is for construction of a public utility and it has been awarded by a statutory body. We are also unable to agree with the observation of the High Court that since the obligations imposed by the contract on the contracting parties come within the purview of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_116\">Contract Act</a>, that would not make the contract statutory. Clearly, the High Court fell into an error in coming to the conclusion that the contract in question was statutory in nature. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">\tA statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a statutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to discharge its functions. Dispute arising out of the terms of such contracts or alleged breaches have to be settled by the ordinary principles of law of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a statutory or public body will not by itself affect the principles to be applied. The disputes about the meaning of a covenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be determined according to the usual principles of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_117\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of a statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private parties, have power to contract or deal with property. Such activities may not raise any issue of public law. In the present case, it has not been shown how the contract is statutory. The contract between the parties is in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory contract. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9701717\" id=\"span_81\">The disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract. Whether any amount is due and if so, how much and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or not, are not the matters which could have been agitated and decided in a writ petition.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n \n\tIn <a href=\"/doc/9701717/\" id=\"a_119\">State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir Vs.

Failure to observe requirements by statutory bodies is enforced by courts by declaring (action) in violation of rules and regulations  to be void.

The protection of such legitimate expectation does not require the fulfilment of the expectation where an overriding public interest requires otherwise.

In the latter case the court would obviously be able to go into the proportionality of the change in the policy......The choice of the policy is for the decision-maker and not for the Court........The protection for substantive legitimate expectation was based on Wednesbury unreasonableness.

Doctrine of legitimate expectation has been developed in the context of principles of natural justice.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\t\n \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_114\">28.\t\tLearned Counsel for the petitioner has relied on 2011(1) SCC 508 Noida Intrepreneurs Association versus Noida Development Authority and Others,  which pertains to allotment and conversion of land or extension of contractual  work and change in land use however, the case of the petitioner is not covered with the above condition because she could not get his residence allotted due to unwarranted dispute raised by the Defence Estate Department.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">29.\t\tSimilarly the case of Ganesh Prasad Versus Lucknow Development Authority Lucknow and Others 2011 (29) LCD page 2541, is also not applicable due to the reason that in that case the government released the land in violation of <a href=\"/doc/983800/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 48(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act due to which layout plan could not be sanctioned.   In the case of Rashid Umar Versus The Chairman Lucknow Development Authority and two Others (Writ Petition No.-11737 (MB) of 2011), is also not applicable for the reason that the place earmarked for park has been allotted to the allottee.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_116\">30.\t\tLearned Counsel for the respondents has submitted that all similarly situated persons, more than 36 allottees who were facing the same problem, were allotted the new accommodation in the new scheme and were directed to pay additional amount which was calculated in accordance with Government order, had been paid and necessary formalities have been executed by the respondents.  Any decision in alteration of the previous decision which has been taken in favour of the other allottees, will be violative of Article 14 of Constitution of India because Lucknow Development Authority has already decided the cost of the land and other allottees had paid it.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">31.\t\tWe have considered the rival contentions of learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as learned Counsel for the respondents and we are of the view that it would not be proper to intervene in the financial/contractual matter which is based on certain policies and calculation of amount in proportion to the land and construction but we are also of the view that since the petitioner had paid some of the amount and it would not be proper to promote either unlawfull enrichment or unjust gain to any of the parties.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">32.\t\tIn K.S. Satyanarayan Vs. V.R. Narayana Rao, AIR 1998 SC 2544, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that juristic basis for such an order of recovery, even if not based on contract or tort, may fall on another category of quasi-contract or restitution. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, while deciding the said case, approved and followed two decisions of English Courts, namely, Filbrosa Vs. Fairbairn, (1942) 2 All.E.R.122; and Nelson Vs. Larholt, (1947) 2 All.E.R. 751, which are quite eliminating and the relevant parts thereof, respectively, are reproduced as under:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">\t&quot;.....any civilised system of law is bound to provide remedies for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit, that is, to prevent a man from retaining the money of, or some benefit derived from, another which it is against conscience that he should keep. Such remedies in English law are generically different from remedies in contract or in tort, and are now recognised to fall within a third category of the common law which has been  called quasi-contract or restitution.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">\t&quot;It is no longer appropriate to draw distinction between law and equity. Principles have now to be stated in the light of their combined effect. Nor is it necessary to canvass the niceties of the old forms of action. Remedies now depend on the substance of the right, not on whether they can be fitted into a particular framework. The right here is not particular to equity or contract or tort, but falls naturally within the important category of cases where the court orders restitution if the justice of the case so requires.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\t\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1854752\" id=\"span_94\">For the same, reliance can also safely be placed on the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1854752/\" id=\"a_138\">State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.

Vs. Union of India</a> &amp; ors., 2003 AIR SCW 186, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court explained the scope of principle of unjust enrichment and held that before a claim is accepted, the claimant has to establish and satisfy the authority concerned that he has not passed on burden to any other person, i.e., consumer. In absence thereof, the money paid by somebody-else cannot be claimed by him.

Real loss or prejudice is suffered in such a case by the person who has ultimately borne the burden, and it is only that person who can legitimately claim its refund. But where such person does not come forward or where it is not possible to refund the amount to him, for one reason or the other, it is just and appropriate that amount is retained by the State, i.e., by the people. The doctrine of unjust enrichment is a just  and solitary doctrine. The power of the Court is not meant to be exercised for unjustly enriching a person. The doctrine of unjust enrichment is, however, inapplicable to the State, for the State represent the people of the country. No one can speak of the people being unjustly enriched.........Beside the principle of unjust enrichment, on equitable principles which squarely apply here, the applicants are not entitled to claim refund of amount paid.......&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"960471\" id=\"span_105\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1692733\" id=\"span_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1848245\" id=\"span_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"714436\" id=\"span_108\">Similar view has been reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/714436/\" id=\"a_150\">Flash Laboratories Ltd.
