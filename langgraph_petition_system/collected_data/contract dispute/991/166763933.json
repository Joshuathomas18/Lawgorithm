In <a href=\"/doc/133653680/\" id=\"a_12\">the said\n\njudgment</a>, the Apex Court has dealt with composite reference and it has held\n\nthat, if they are separate/multiple contracts exist independently with their\n\nown separate arbitration clauses, it is not possible to establish a single\n\narbitral tribunal and, however, the concept of dealing with this situation has\n\nbeen addressed in the arena of international commercial arbitration. It has\n\nbeen observed that when the arbitration agreement is sufficiently broad to\n\nencompass ancillary agreements related to the main agreement, the entirety\n                                                                                JSR, J\n                                                                Arb.App.186 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                     20</span>\n\n\n\nof disputes arising from both the main agreement and the ancillary\n\nagreements can be resolved through a comprehensive reference process.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">13.   In the current situation at hand, the primary dispute between the\n\nparties revolves around the question is whether a single application for the\n\nappointment of an arbitrator is permissible when there is no overarching\n\nagreement and the contracts in question are separate and distinct. In the\n\npresent case applicant has been entrusted with nine subcontract works by the\n\nrespondent, as outlined in paragraphs 7 (a) to (j) of the application. The\n\nconcept of a composite reference process is not applicable in this scenario as\n\nthe documentary evidence available on record indicates that the execution of\n\nthese ten individual sub-contracts has taken place across various\n\nindependent irrigation projects. Throughout the contract execution period,\n\nthe parties have consistently treated these contracts as separate and distinct\n\nentities.

The learned Senior Counsel for GPL relied upon <a href=\"/doc/1500505/\" id=\"a_14\">Chloro Controls India\n     Private Ltd.</a> (supra), to contend that where various agreements constitute a\n     composite transaction, court can refer disputes to arbitration if all ancillary\n     agreements are relatable to principal agreement and performance of one\n     agreement is so intrinsically interlinked with other agreements. Even though\n     Chloro Controls has considered the doctrine of &quot;composite reference&quot;,\n     &quot;composite performance&quot; etc., ratio of Chloro Controls may not be applicable\n     to the case in hand. In Chloro Controls, the arbitration clause in the principal\n     agreement i.e. clause (30) required that any dispute or difference arising\n     under or in connection with the principal (mother) agreement, which could\n     not be settled by friendly negotiation and agreement between the parties,\n     would be finally settled by arbitration conducted in accordance with Rules of\n     ICC.

In that\n     background, the performance of all other agreements by respective parties\n     including third. parties/non-signatories had to fall in line with the principal\n     agreement.

The issue of maintainability of the proceedings as has been raised by\nthe respondent requires consideration. According to the respondent, the\nparties had entered into two separate and distinct contracts containing\nindividual arbitration agreements and therefore, the two contracts cannot\nbe clubbed together in one reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133653680\" id=\"span_35\">17. <a href=\"/doc/133653680/\" id=\"a_22\">DuroFelguera, S.A.</a> (supra) has dealt with the concept of composite\nreference. It has held that, when there are separate contracts each\nhaving independent existence with separate arbitration clauses then\nthere cannot be a single arbitral tribunal. It has however dealt with\nsuch concept in the context of international commercial arbitration. It\nhas noticed that, in the event, the arbitration agreement is such that, it\nis wide enough to make it comprehensive and bring within its ambit,\nagreements ancillary to the mother agreement then, the entire disputes\narising out of the mother and the ancillary agreements can be settled\nby a composite reference.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">21. Under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 7</a> of the Act of 1996 an arbitration agreement has to\nbe in writing between identifiable parties referring specified disputes in\nrespect of a defined legal relationship whether contractual or not. A\ncomposite reference is permissible under the Act of 1996. In order to\nmake a composite reference, various factors have to amalgamate so as\nto make a composite reference possible. There has to be a mother\nagreement and ancillary agreements governing the parties. The\nconcerned arbitration agreement or the mother agreement should be\ncomprehensive enough to bring within its fold agreements ancillary to\nthe mother agreement so that, the disputes arising out of or in\nconnection with the mother agreement or the ancillary agreement\ncan be settled by a composite reference. If the parties have entered into\nseveral agreements in respect of a single commercial project, then also,\nthe disputes and differences arising out of the various agreements\ncould be resolved by referring the parties to a composite arbitration.\nEssentially, there has to be a single commercial project under which,\n                                                                                        JSR, J\n                                                                        Arb.App.186 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                          25</span>\n\n\n\n      there may or may not be several contracts or agreements involving\n      various parties.The arbitration agreement of the single commercial\n      project should be wide enough to encompass the parties to the\n      subsequent agreements. Again if there are two or more contracts and\n      they are so intertwined with each other so as to prejudice the parties\n      should separate arbitrations are held, then a composite reference can\n      be made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500505\" id=\"span_37\">22. Although the Act of 1996 has stipulated that, there must be a written\n      agreement between the parties to refer the disputes and differences to\n      arbitration, <a href=\"/doc/1500505/\" id=\"a_24\">Chloro Controls India Private Limited</a> (supra) has recognised\n      an exception thereto, that is to say, any non- party to an arbitration\n      agreement can also be subjected to arbitration. However the same has to\n      be in exceptional circumstances and upon a finding that, the transaction\n      in question is of a composite nature where performance of the mother\n      agreement may not be feasible without the aid, execution and\n      performance of supplementary or ancillary agreements for achieving the\n      common object and collectively having bearing on the dispute. The\n      Court must also arrive at a finding that, a composite reference would\n      serve the ends of justice. Only then, the Court can direct a non-party to\n      the arbitration agreement to arbitration.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"133653680\" id=\"span_38\">16.   This court is in agreement with the above view taken by the High\n\nCourt of Calcutta. The principle which can be carved out from the Apex\n\nCourt&#x27;sJudgement in <a href=\"/doc/133653680/\" id=\"a_25\">DuroFelguera, S.A</a> (supra), is that in orderto invoke\n\nthe doctrine of composite reference, it is necessary that the agreements in\n\nquestion have to be governed by a principle (mother) agreement. It is only\n\nwhen agreements are entered subsequent to the mother agreement, they\n\nbecome ancillary agreements which can then be referred to a composite\n                                                                               JSR, J\n                                                               Arb.App.186 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                     26</span>\n\n\n\nreference. In the present case, there is no principle (mother) agreement\n\ngoverning the sub-contracts, as these contracts do not arise from a single\n\ncommercial project. The contracts have been entered between the parties\n\nbasing separate terms and conditions, arising out of different nature and\n\nscope of the work. In essence, the parties have distinct contracts, each with\n\na separate name and arbitration clause. During the execution of the sub-\n\ncontract agreements, namely a) the Gajuladinne Project, 2) the Kanchi\n\nProject, 3) the Kokro Project, and d) four different projects in Jamshedpur\n\ndistrict (as mentioned above), the parties involved have treated these\n\ncontracts as separate and independent entities. The sub-contract agreements\n\nhave not been entered under or in connection with a principle agreement.\n\nThey are independent in nature and do not arise from a single commercial\n\nproject, on the contrary each sub-contract agreement is executed for the\n\npurposes of a different projects located at different regions in the country.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be said that sub-contract agreements in dispute can be\n\nsubjected to &#x27;composite reference&#x27;as they are in essence distinct and\n\nindependent sub-contract agreements, not arising from a single commercial\n\nproject, therefore, a single application for seeking appointment of sole\n                                                                                  JSR, J\n                                                                  Arb.App.186 of 2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                        27</span>\n\n\n\narbitrator is not maintainable.
