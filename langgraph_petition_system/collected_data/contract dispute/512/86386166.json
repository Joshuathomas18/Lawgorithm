The dispute as regards the payments had arisen in view of \n\n    the fact that the MCGM had discontinued the payments as per the contractual \n\n    lgc                                                                                      3 of 55\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">           ::: Uploaded on - 08/02/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/02/2017 01:15:12 :::</span>\n                                                                                           APP-914.03\n\n    terms on   the  ground  that  it  had   over   paid  the  contractor   in   respect  of   the \n\n    earlier   running   bills.     The   said   dispute   did   not   get   resolved   before   the \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          \n    Municipal   Commissioner   resulting   in   the   said   Atlanta   Infrastructure   Ltd \n\n\n\n\n                                                                  \n    invoking Clause 97 and proceeding to arbitration.   It seems that before the \n\n    learned   Arbitrator   the   claim   was   made   under   5   heads   by   the   said   Atlanta \n\n\n\n\n                                                                 \n    Infrastructure Ltd.  The MCGM had filed its reply to the said claim made by the \n\n    said   Atlanta   Infrastructure   Ltd.   and   had   also   filed   a   Counter   Claim.     The \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    learned   Arbitrator   had   allowed   the   claims   of   the   Atlanta   Infrastructure   Ltd \n                                     \n    whereas had rejected the Counter Claim of the MCGM.   This resulted in the \n\n    MCGM   filing   an   Arbitration   Petition   in   this   Court   being   No.184   of   1992 \n                                    \n    challenging the Award.  A learned Single Judge of this Court did not find any \n\n    reason to interfere with the Award dated 30/09/1992 passed by the learned \n             \n\n\n    Arbitrator and accordingly dismissed the said Arbitration Petition. The MCGM \n          \n\n\n\n    carried the matter in Appeal by way of Appeal No.662 of 1995 and companion \n\n    Appeals.   The  said Appeals came up before  a  Division  Bench of  this Court. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">    Before the Division Bench a contention was raised on behalf of the MCGM that \n\n    having not raised the dispute before the Municipal Commissioner by invoking \n\n\n\n\n\n    Clause   96   the   contractor   could   not   have   raised   the   claims   by   invoking   the \n\n    Arbitration   Clause.     It   was   the   contention   of   the   MCGM   that   since   no \n\n    communication   was   received   from   the   Municipal   Commissioner,   the   same \n\n    would mean that the claims have been rejected and therefore the disputes are \n\n    not arbitrable.   It was alternatively contended on behalf of the  MCGM that \n\n\n    lgc                                                                                          4 of 55\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">            ::: Uploaded on - 08/02/2017                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/02/2017 01:15:12 :::</span>\n                                                                                            APP-914.03\n\n    since certain claims were not raised before the Municipal Commissioner, the \n\n    same could not have been raised for the first time before the Arbitrator under \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                           \n    Clause 97.   The said contentions were rejected by the Division Bench of this \n\n\n\n\n                                                                   \n    Court by holding that there is nothing in the said Clauses by which one could \n\n    conclude that the reference to the arbitration is in any way dependent upon \n\n\n\n\n                                                                  \n    the   outcome   of   the   proceedings   before   the   Municipal   Commissioner.     The \n\n    Division Bench further held that the Municipal Commissioner is also not a final \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    authority and in terms of Clause 96 itself his decision can be the subject matter \n                                     \n    of arbitration if the party is not satisfied by it.   The Division Bench therefore \n\n    concluded   that   it   is   not   as   if   the   contractor   must   first   approach   the \n                                    \n    Commissioner   or   that   he   can   seek   reference   of   only   such   disputes   and \n\n    differences to arbitration, which have earlier been subject matter of decision by \n             \n\n\n    the Municipal Commissioner.

It should touch or \n                   concern the said work or any of them or relating to the \n\n\n\n\n\n                   quantities,   qualities,   description   or   manner   of   work \n                   done and executed by the contractor or to the quantity \n                   or quality of the materials to be employed therein or in \n                   respect   of   any   additions,   deductions,   alterations   or \n                   deviations made into or from the said works etc.. The \n                   clause contemplates, therefore, reference of disputes or \n                   differences during the course of execution of contract, \n                   to   the   Municipal   Commissioner,   who   is   to   give   his \n                   decision thereon.

The \n\n    contractor by letter dated 11/09/1990 had called upon the Chief Engineer of \n\n\n\n\n                                                                  \n    the   MCGM   to   pay   an   amount   of   Rs.50,84,877.57.     It   seems   that   the   Chief \n\n    Engineer did not reply to the said letter   of the Plaintiff and in spite of the \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    reminders to the Chief Engineer, no cognizance was taken which resulted in \n                                     \n    neither   the   amount   being   paid   nor   any   extension   being   granted   to   the \n\n    contractor for completion of the work.  The contractor therefore by letter dated \n                                    \n    14/11/1991   requested   the   Municipal   Commissioner   to   adjudicate   upon   the \n\n    claim as per Clause 96 of the General Conditions of Contract.  By letter dated \n             \n\n\n    27/01/1992, the MCGM informed the contractor that the Plaintiffs&#x27; demand for \n          \n\n\n\n    compensation   has   already   been   rejected   earlier   as   it   did   not   fit   in   the \n\n    conditions.  It is in the said circumstances that the Plaintiffs had filed the said \n\n\n\n\n\n    Arbitration Suit.  Before the learned Single Judge of this Court the said Clauses \n\n    96 and 97 of the General Conditions of Contract were in contention.  It seems \n\n\n\n\n\n    that an objection was raised on behalf of the MCGM that a notice to proceed to \n\n    arbitration   under   Clause   97   has   not   been   addressed   to   the   MCGM   by   the \n\n    contractor.  It was contended on behalf of the contractor that having regard to \n\n    Clauses   96   and   97,   notice   was   not   required   to   be   issued   for   invocation   of \n\n    Clause 97.

The same would result in the removal of \n                                     \n    the   difficulties   faced   by   a   contractor   on   the   site   so   that   the   work   can   be \n\n    proceeded   with.     Merely   because   certain   expressions   like   &quot;touching   or \n             \n\n\n    concerning any certificate, order or reward&quot; &quot;every such doubt, dispute and \n          \n\n\n\n    difference&quot;  are   used  in   the   said  Clause   96,  the   same   would  not  expand  its \n\n    expanse so as to cover every conceivable dispute either before or after the work \n\n\n\n\n\n    is completed.  The said Clause cannot be construed differently than the clauses \n\n    which   are   worded   similarly   and   in   which   cases   it   has   been   held   that \n\n\n\n\n\n    determination is not by any adjudicatory process i.e. by giving an opportunity \n\n    to the parties to lead evidence etc., but is summary in nature.  Hence Clause 96 \n\n    cannot be construed any more than a clause which provides for an in house \n\n    mechanism for redressal of the disputes or differences relating to the work on \n\n    site.
