One of the  items\nin dispute was a &#x27;claim by the respondent that there was  an\nexcess\tsupply\tof timber to cover  up\tpossible  rejection,\nwhich should be returned by the appellant with\tcompensation\nfor deterioration, or that payment should be made for it  at\nthe market value.  The appellant contended that the terms of\nthe  contract did not require the respondent to\t tender\t for\ninspection  an,of  quantity  in\t excess\t of  the  contracted\nquantity,  that\t the  claim was in detinue  relating  to  an\ninvoluntary bailment and not in relation to anything done in\nthe   performance,  implementation  or\texecution   of\t the\ncontract;  and therefore., it was not a dispute arising\t out\nof the contract or in connection with the contract.\n    On the question whether the arbitrators had jurisdiction\nto adjudicate upon the claim,\n    HELD:  The\ttest for determing the question\t is  whether\nrecourse  to  the contract, by which both the  parties\t are\nhound,\t was   necessary  for  the  purpose  of\t determining\nwhether\t the claim of  the respondent was    justified\t  or\notherwise.

The  respondent\tfirm claimed a\tsum  of\t Rs.\n73,50,000 while the appellant contended that the  respondent\ncommitted  breach  of  the contract  by\t not  supplying\t the\nstipulated  quantity  of timber under the contract  and\t  as\nsuch  claimed  damages to the extent of Rs.  3,00,000.\t The\ncase  of the respondent firm was that in order to  cover  up\npossible  rejection, a quantity of timber much in excess  of\nthe contracted quantity was despatched to the consignees and\nthe excess quantity measuring 3,400 tons i.e. 1,70,000 cubic\nfeet was still lying with the Lillooah consignnee and  1,500\ntons  i.e. 75,000 cubic feet with the  Halisahaar  consignee\nand  had not been returned despite repeated  requests.\t The\nrespondent  firm claimed return of this quantity  of  timber\nand   compensation   for   its\t deterioration.\t   It\t was\nalternatively  contended that in case the Government  failed\nto  return  the\t whole or part of the  excess  timber,\tthen\npayment for that quantity at the market rate should be made.\nThe appellant in its reply denied the allegation relating to\nthe  delivery  and  retention  of excess quantity.

It was stated\nthat  the terms of contract did not require  the  respondent\nfirm to tender for inspection any quantity in excess of\t the\ncontracted  quantity  of timber and the alleged\t placing  of\nunlimited   stocks  of\ttimber\tat  the\t  disposal  of\t the\nGovernment  officials far in excess of the quantity  ordered\nwas  beyond the scope of the contract.\tIt was argued\tthat\nthe  claim  should  be\ttreated as a  claim  relating  to  a\ntransaction of involuntary bailment and not to anything done\nin  the\t performance.  implementation or  execution  of\t the\ncontract.   It was said that the claim for return  of  these\ngoods  and damages for deterioration or in  the\t alternative\nfor   their  market  value was a claim in  detinue  and\t the\ndispute\t was  not  hence  a  dispute  &quot;arising\tout  of\t the\ncontract&quot;  or  &#x27;in connection with the contract&#x27; but  was  a\ndispute\t relating, to a tort of wrongful detention.   We  do\nnot  think that there is any justification for the  argument\nput forward on behalf of the appellant.\t In our opinion. the\nclaim made by the respondent firm was a claim arising out of\nthe  contract.\tThe  test for determining  the\tquestion  is\nwhether\t recourse to the contract by which both the  parties\nare  bound  is\tnecessary for  the  purpose  of\t determining\nwhether\t the  claim of the respondent firm iS  justified  or\notherwise.  If it is necessary to take recourse to the terms\nof  the contract for the purpose of deciding the  matter  in\ndispute. it must be held that the matter is within the scope\nof   the  arbitration  clause  and  the\t  arbitrators\thave\njurisdiction  to  decide this case.  In Herman\t&amp;  lint.  v.\nDarwins Ltd.(1) the law on the point is very clearly  stated\nin the following passage:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(1) [1942] A.C. 356 at 365.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">229</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t\t    &quot;An\t arbitration  clause  is  a  written\n\t      submission  agreed  to by the parties  to\t the\n\t      contract, and, like other written\t submissions\n\t      to arbitration, must be construed according to\n\t      its   language  and  in  the  light   of\t the\n\t      circumstances  in\t which it is made.   if\t the\n\t      dispute is whether the contract which contains\n\t      the clause has ever been entered into at\tall,\n\t      that issue cannot go to arbitration under\t the\n\t      clause,  for the party who denies that he\t has\n\t      ever  entered  into the  contract\t is  thereby\n\t      denying  that  he\t has  ever  joined  in\t the\n\t      submission.

The insured did\nnot  take  any\taction in regard to the\t appointment  of  an\narbitrator  until  more than twelve months  after  the\tlast\ndisclaimer  by the company.The case of the company was\tthat\nthe  insured must be deemed to have abandoned his  claim  by\nvirtue\tof  the\t contract  of  insurance  policy  while\t the\nrespondent averted that there was never any valid disclaimer\nby the company of its liability as the Branch Manager had no\nauthority  to disclaim the liability and it could have\tbeen\ndisclaimed  only  by  the resolution of\t the  company.\t The\ncompany\t made  an  application under s.\t 33  of\t the  Indian\nArbitration Act praying for a declaration that the reference\nto  arbitration\t was illegal and the award if  made  by\t the\narbitrator would not bind the company.\tIt was contended  on\nits  behalf  that the arbitration clause had  ceased  to  be\noperative and the question as to the existence and  validity\nof the arbitration agreement was triable by the court  under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_8\">\ns. 33</a> of the Arbitration Act and not by the arbitrator.\t The\nargument  was rejected by this Court.  It was held that\t the\npoint on which the parties were in dispute was a difference\n(1) [1952] 3.C.R. 501.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">231</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">arising out of the policy, because recourse to the  contract\nby  which both the parties were bound was necessary for\t the\npurpose\t of determining the matter in dispute between  them.\nAs  there was no contention raised by either of the  parties\nthat  there was no contract entered into at all or  that  it\nwas void ab initio the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide\nthe  matter referred to him.  In our opinion, the  principle\napplies to the present case and it follows that the  dispute\nbetween\t  the  parties\tfalls  within  the  scope   of\t the\narbitration clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">    On behalf of the appellant reliance was &#x27;placed upon the\ndecision of Court of Appeal in Percy v. Young(1) in which it\nwas  held that the clause &quot;that any differences or  disputes\nthat  may arise between the partners shah be settled  by  an\narbitrator&quot;   does  not\t include  a  dispute   whether\t the\npartnership  has been terminated, or whether certain  shares\nhave  been  paid  on account to the partnership\t or  to\t one\npartner alone.\tIn our opinion, the principle does not apply\nin  the\t present  case\twhere  the  question  presented\t for\ndetermination is quite different.  Counsel for the appellant\nalso  referred to Turnock v. Sartoris(2). In that  case\t the\nlessor\twas  under a covenant to supply his  lessee  with  a\nspecific   quantity  of\t water.\t  The  lease   contained   a\ncomprehensive  arbitration clause. Dispute having arisen  as\nto  the\t supply\t of water,  an\tagreement  was\tsubsequently\nentered\t into, binding the lessor to take certain  steps  to\nsecure\tthe supply and varying the rights of the parties  in\nrespect\t of  the  supply.   The\t lessee\t brought  an  action\nalleging  that the steps agreed upon had not been taken\t and\nthat  he had not been fully supplied with water\t and  asking\nfor an action of the .damages to be taken.  The lessor moved\nto  have the action stayed. lit was held that  the  disputed\nmatters\t arose partly under the agreement and  were  outside\nthe arbitration clause in the lease and that even if all the\nmatters for which damages  were\t claimed  could\t be  brought\nwithin\tthe  arbitration clause it would not  be  proper  to\nrefer  them  to\t an  arbitration  who  would  not  have\t the\nauthority to construe the agreement to determine its  effect\nupon  the  lease.  It is manifest that the decision  has  no\nbearing\t upon the question p.resented for  determination  in\nthe present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">    For\t the  reasons. already expressed, we hold  that\t the\nclaim  of  the respondent firm was within the scope  of\t the\narbitration clause and the application made by the appellant\nin  Suit  No.  128 of 1963 was.\t rightly  dismissed  by\t the\nSubordinate  Judge.  Accordingly, the appeal  fails  and  is\ndismissed with costs.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">V.P.S.\t\t\t\t\t   Appeal dismissed.\n(1) 14 oh. D. 200.\n(2) 43 Cn.
