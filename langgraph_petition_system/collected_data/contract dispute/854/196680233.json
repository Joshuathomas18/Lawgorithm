It is already noted that the only ground for\n            filing of the suit is that the petitioner/\n            defendants have not paid the outstanding dues\n            payable to the plaintiff / respondents. Such a\n            condition is not incorporated in the bank\n            guarantee, the bank guarantee in question is an\n            unconditional one. The said bank guarantee\n            cannot be said to be outside the scope of the\n            agreement arrived at between the parties which\n            also contained the arbitration clause. In such a\n            matter, the agreement is to be considered in its\n            widest amplitude and contents and also would\n            include the question of existence and effect of\n            arbitration agreement and, thus, going to the\n            root of the dispute raised in the suit. The said\n            agreement between the parties cannot be\n            ignored including the suit, rather the whole\n            basis of the claim of the plaintiff is their right\n            that flows from the said agreement.

The centripetal question is whether the bank guarantee\nand requirement of extension period thereof is having linkage\nwith the stipulations in the contract and whether the dispute on\nthat count could be considered as an arbitrable dispute.

It is\nalso not the question to be addressed as in what circumstances\nin law the encashment of the bank guarantee can be permitted\nor restrained. It is to be noticed that the case of the respondent\nis also that the bank guarantee is conditional bank guarantee.\nThe moot question to be addressed is the interlinkage and\ninseparability of supply agreement covenants and the bank\nguarantee contents interacting with each other.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">5.1       By letter dated 18.1.2020, the appellant requested for\nextension of bank guarantee for a period of two years and in the\nevent the extension is not provided for, then the bank guarantee\nmay be allowed to be claimed and proceeds may be paid.\nAppellant&#x27;s case is specific that dispute regarding extension or\nnon extension of bank guarantee has arisen in light of the\ncompliance or otherwise of Clause 6.1 of the supply agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">6.

Now referring to the conditions in the supply\nagreement with contents of the bank guarantees in question,\njuxtaposed            with   one    another,       and     the     other        attendant\nstipulations in the contract, what emerges is that the bank\nguarantee was issued pursuant to the contract dated 28.3.2015\nas amended from time to time and the same was issued by the\nguarantors            to   ensure   the    compliance         of    the      contractual\nobligation by the supplier- the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">7.1       In order to appreciate the nexus, it may be recollected that\nthe amended clause No. 6.1 in the contract reproduced in para\nNo.3.2.2 above, inter alia contemplates that the plaintiff shall\nprovide unconditional irrevocable bank guarantee equal to 10%\nof the contract price. Further contemplation therein is that the\nperformance guarantee shall be valid till the guarantee period is\ncompleted &quot;for all the equipments&quot;.                     The providence in that is\nthat the plaintiff shall extend the validity of the performance\nguarantee for the balance guarantee period at least two months\nprior to the expiry of the existing performance guarantees.\nClause 6.1 further says about the manner of invocation of the\nbank guarantees in question. Clause 26 and 27 of the contract\nmentions about the right to invoke the bank guarantees.

Necessarily, a\ndispute pertaining to validity, extension and invocation of the\nbank guarantee is necessarily one involving the application,\nconsideration and appreciation together with the clauses of the\ncontract. Therefore, the dispute relating to the extension of the\nvalidity and invocation of the guarantee would be a dispute\ncovered under &#x27;relating to&#x27; and/or &quot;arising out of the contract&quot; in\nclause No. 28.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">7.3    Even when the averments in the plaint and the frame of\nthe suit are considered, it could be seen that the plaintiff himself\npleaded the interwovenness of the supply agreement and the\nbank guarantees in the operation of their respective relevant\nterms. The attention of the court was invited to para Nos.7, 8, 9,\n11 and 12 of the plaint. Reproduced is para 12, which reads as\nunder,\n\n\n            &quot;12.

Upon a conjoint reading of the clauses 6.1, 8, 26\nand 27 in the supply contract read with the contents and the\nconditions of the bank guarantee with contractual terms, the\ndispute could well be said to have arisen which is &#x27;in relation to&#x27;\nthe contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">8.        The contention of the respondent so as to place reliance on\n<a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Arbitration Act is not well conceived in the\ncontext of fact situation of the case. The case of the defendant is\nnot that the arbitration agreement to be exported to the bank\nguarantee contents to read into it, rather, the case is that the\ndispute relating to extension or invocation of the bank guarantee\nfalls within the ambit of arbitration clause.
