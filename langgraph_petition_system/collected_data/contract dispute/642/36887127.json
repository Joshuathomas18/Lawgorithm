The reasoning adopted by the learned Arbitral\n                      Tribunal is unreasonable.

This Court has in several other judgments\n                                   interpreted Section 34 of the 1996 Act to stress on\n                                   the restraint to be shown by Courts while\n                                   examining the validity of the arbitral awards. The\n                                   limited grounds available to Courts for annulment\n                                   of arbitral awards are well known to legally\n                                   trained minds. However, the difficulty arises in\n                                   applying the well-established principles for\n                                   interference to the facts of each case that come up\n                                   before the Courts. There is a disturbing tendency\n                                   of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after\n                                   dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the\n                                   cases to come to a conclusion that the award needs\n                                   intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to\n                                   be vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality,\n                                   apart from the other grounds available for\n                                   annulment of the award. This approach would lead\n                                   to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the\n                                   endeavours made to preserve this object, which is\n                                   minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards.\n                                   That apart, several judicial pronouncements of this\n                                   Court would become a dead letter if arbitral\n                                   awards are set aside by categorising them as\n                                   perverse or patently illegal without appreciating\n                                   the contours of the said expressions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                                                                            Page 26 of 71</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                      O.M.P.

When a court applies the „public policy‟ test to\n                      an arbitration award, the court does not function as a court of appeal, and\n                      as a result, any mistakes of fact that may have been made cannot be\n                      rectified. This is something that must be recognized very well. Since, the\n                      arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to\n                      be relied upon when delivering his arbitral award, each possible view that\n                      the arbitrator may have on the facts needs to pass his approval in order for\n                      it to be considered. Therefore, an award that is based on scant evidence or\n                      on evidence that a trained legal mind deems to be of insufficient quality\n                      would not be deemed to be invalid on the basis of this criterion. After it\n                      has been established that the arbitrator&#x27;s method is neither arbitrary nor\n                      capricious, then it can be said that he has the final word on the facts.\n                      There is also no dispute on the position of law that an Arbitrator being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                                            Page 28 of 71</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">Digitally Signed</span>\n                      O.M.P.

What\n                      constitutes work within or outside the scope of the work clause in a\n                      construction contract is a source of contention among contract parties,\n                      culminating in substantial commercial arbitrations. This disagreement\n                      raises the question of whether work performed outside the scope of the\n                      construction contract entitles a party to additional remuneration for the\n                      services performed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"999284\" id=\"span_122\">85.

Considering the view adopted by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, it is\n                      a settled position of law that the Arbitrator cannot exceed the contract&#x27;s\n                      provisions. An arbitrator must decide in accordance with the terms of the\n                      Contract. However, if an arbitrator interprets term of the contract in a\n                      reasonable manner, this will not be a ground for setting aside the Award.\n                      The Arbitrator is primarily responsible for determining the interpretation\n                      of a contract&#x27;s provisions, unless the arbitrator interprets the contract in a\n                      way that no fair-minded or reasonable person could do.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                                                                          Page 42 of 71</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">                      O.M.P.

The learned Arbitral Tribunal has taken the ground that, the clauses\n                      and terms relied upon by the respondent determine that, in case of change\n                      in scope of work, the price has to be adjusted accordingly. Further, as also\n                      observed by the learned Tribunal, the respondent had submitted its price\n                      bid with reference to the scope of work indicated in the bid documents\n                      and the learned Tribunal has critically held that the increase in scope of\n                      work is a dramatic modification and the petitioner cannot possibly\n                      circumvent the competitive procurement process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">                      92.   The learned Tribunal has given sufficient reasoning keeping in\n                      view the scope of work in the tender documents. It has held that, in an\n                      EPC contract, prospective bidders must be informed of the owner&#x27;s\n                      desired scope of work, and when so indicated, as in the present case, with\n                      the stipulation that the work described in the tender documents is merely\n                      indicative, modifications may be made within the outer parameters of the\n                      defined scope of work, and the contractor cannot claim that the scope of\n                      work was expanded. These outer parameters are immutable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">                      93.   The learned Arbitral Tribunal was of the view that, by shifting the\n                      chainage points and increasing the scope of work, the petitioner cannot\n                      take refuge on the words ‗indicative of&#x27; used in the bid documents. The\n                      learned Tribunal highlighted that vis-a-vis the bid documents and the\n                      final approved FSR, the track length got increased from 21.5 Kms to\n                      25.136 Kms. The learned Tribunal has further held the change in scope of\n                      work by the petitioner is done consciously, under the garb that, what was\n                      indicated earlier was merely ‗indicative of&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">                      94.

The petitioner is\n                      incorrect in asserting that the claim was founded solely on the increase in\n                      track length, as the respondent also performed numerous ancillary works\n                      in order to increase the track length. The aggregate claim for the railway\n                      siding work comprised all such works that were necessitated by the\n                      lengthening of the railway track.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">                      95.   Further, by applying the ratio of the abovementioned judgments,\n                      the principle of quantum meruit is being considered here. Compensation\n                      under quantum meruit is awarded for the services rendered by the\n                      contractor when the payment thereof is not fixed by the contract. A\n                      quantum meruit claim arises, where work is done or services rendered by\n                      the contractor for the employer or owner, in circumstances which entitle\n                      the constructor doing the work or rendering the services to receive a\n                      reasonable additional remuneration, the situation being one where either\n                      there is no construction contract or there is a contract but the particular\n                      situation is not covered under that construction contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_119\">                      96.   This Court further finds that, after accepting the respondent&#x27;s\n                      proposal, the petitioner increased the scope of the railway siding works\n                      without good faith. Therefore, claiming subsequently that the respondent\n                      had no right to claim additional amounts because the scope of work in the\n                      earlier FSR was indicative and the Contract was an EPC Contract, is\n                      merely an attempt to conceal its violations. This aspect of the petitioner&#x27;s\n                      conduct has been meticulously addressed in the Award by the learned\n                      Tribunal, which has, to its credit, noted the petitioner&#x27;s conduct.

The bore hole\n                                  data provides the morphological features of the\n                                  soil and the same generates the load bearing\n                                  capacity of the soil. For example, boring 6 feet\n                                  below the ground level the morphological features\n                                  of the soil continue to show the same to be loamy,\n                                  sans presence of rocks, the load bearing capacity\n                                  of the soil would be less requiring either the length\n                                  and breadth of the pillars to be increased so that\n                                  the section area is more and as a result, per square\n                                  meter pressure is less, or to bore deeper to reach a\n                                  soil strata which has rock and can withstand a\n                                  higher load bearing capacity, and as a result the\n                                  length and the breadth of the pillars to be less i.e.\n                                  section area less.

The respondent did not dispute that\n                                  after the coal boulders were removed and the\n                                  claimant generated the bore hole data in the IDCT\n                                  area, the foundation level changed from 151.07m\n                                  to 148.67m. The difference is 151.07 - 148.67 =\n                                  2.4.

This got\n                                  revised to 4.92m. Thus, it is apparent that with\n                                  reference to the NGL and the other data and\n                                  parameters given in the bid documents the\n                                  foundation level would work out to 151.07 and the\n                                  RL to+ 153.25. After the bore hole data was\n                                  generated, these figures got changed to 148.67 and\n                                  149.948.

There is another interesting aspect to this\n                                  issue. Two cooling towers called Unit-I and Unit-II\n                                  were to be erected by the claimant in the IDCT\n                                  Area.

During execution,\n                                  claimant detected change in soil strata and found\n                                  NGL for Unit-I at 149.948m and for Unit-2 at\n                                  150.872m.

We need to be\n                                         cognizant of the fact that arbitral\n                                         awards should not be interfered with in\n                                         a casual and cavalier manner, unless\n                                         the Court comes to a conclusion that\n                                         the perversity of the award goes to the\n                                         root of the matter without there being a\n                                         possibility of alternative interpretation\n                                         which may sustain the arbitral\n                                         award.

In light of the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court mentioned\n                      hereinabove, it is particularly evident that the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 34</a> of\n                      the Act, 1996 grants limited scope of scrutiny and interference by the\n                      Courts. The same has to be followed in its true letter and spirit, as also\n                      observed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in various cases. The Arbitral\n                      Tribunal&#x27;s decision regarding the interpretation of a contract is final, and\n                      the court cannot substitute its own interpretation for that of the arbitral\n                      tribunal.

In addition, per Clause\n                      10.1, the petitioner must have ensured the accuracy of all information and\n                      data provided by the petitioner. Due to the same, the learned Tribunal\n                      held that there was a substantial increase in the amount of work to be\n                      performed compared to what was anticipated before the contract was\n                      awarded to the respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                      110.

Further, it is only in the interest of justice that the learned Tribunal\n                      has considered the scenario to allow the Claim No. 2 in favour of the\n                      respondent. It is only because the respondent had incurred extra costs due\n                      to the unforeseen conditions.

This Court is of the view that, the issue before the learned Tribunal\n                      was not related to the supply of the two different types of\n                      module/chamber, but was regarding the reimbursement of cost towards\n                      the additional cost incurred by the respondent in conducting the\n                      additional test on the insistence of the petitioner. Hence, the respondent\n                      became entitled to be paid, at the rate quoted for the type tests it\n                      conducted. Although the respondent carried out the identical test on both\n                      the single-chamber and the double-chamber Bay Module, this would not\n                      entail that they only performed a single test overall. When one test is\n                      carried out on two different pieces of equipment, this does not constitute\n                      a single test having been carried out. The test that was carried out was in\n                      plural, as also observed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">                      116.

This Court is unable to accept that the\n                                  Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s view with regard to\n                                  interpretation of Clause 26 of SCC is patently\n                                  illegal and no reasonable person could have\n                                  accepted the same. The said view is clearly a\n                                  plausible one.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">                      122. The aforementioned judgment is similar to the instant matter. The\n                      Court held that the clauses relating to the change in basic wages is clear\n                      and unambiguous. It was held that the Court must only interfere when the\n                      illegality goes to the root of the matter. The Court further affirmed the\n                      view of the Arbitral Tribunal that the notification of the minimum wages\n                      for labour is in two parts. The first being the basic minimum wage\n                      rate and the second being a VDA. The second component of VDA was\n                      already factored as per Appendix - 2 of the Contract Agreement, which is\n                      again, similar to the instant matter. Thus, it was accepted that the\n                      Appendix-2 only factored in the VDA and did not factor in any rise in the\n                      basic minimum rate of wages.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">                      123. The learned Arbitral Tribunal in the present matter, has taken into\n                      account the VDA and has confirmed the stand of the respondent that the\n                      Appendix - 2 is applicable only to the periodic increase in the VDA, and\n                      has no concern with the increase in minimum wages. It further held that\n                      the increase in minimum wages is due to issuance of notification by the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                                                                                        Page 66 of 71</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">Digitally Signed</span>\n                      O.M.P.

In view of the judgment referred to in the foregoing paragraphs, it\n                      is apparent that the learned Tribunal has rightly allowed the claim qua\n                      increase in minimum basic wage due to change in law. In this instance,\n                      the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s interpretation of Clauses 25, 31.4.1 and 31.4.03 of\n                      Special Conditions‟ construction is plausible. The learned Arbitral\n                      Tribunal has applied its judicial mind in a proper manner by not enforcing\n                      a principle which can be termed to be against the public policy of India.\n                      Since, no relevant grounds in terms of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 34</a> of the Act, 1996 is\n                      made out by the petitioner, this Court cannot disturb the impugned Award\n                      as the same has been passed after assessing and appreciating all the\n                      factual aspects and contractual provisions. Therefore, this Court finds no\n                      perversity in the reasoning of the learned Arbitral Tribunal by allowing\n                      Claim No. 4.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">                      125. In view of the above, I do not find any reason to interfere with the\n                      impugned Award qua Claim No. 4.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">                      126. In view of the abovementioned judgments and discussion, this\n                      Court is of the view that the patent illegality should be an illegality which\n                      goes to the foundation of the matter. To put it in another way, not every\n                      violation of the law that is committed by the Arbitral Tribunal would be\n                      considered, an instance of patent illegality. Furthermore, an incorrect\n                      application of law cannot be classified as blatantly breaking the law. In\n                      addition, the term patent illegality does not apply to violations of law that\n                      is not connected to public policy or the interest of the general public.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">                                                                                          Page 67 of 71</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">                      O.M.P.

Since it has been a settled principle that it is against the law for the\n                      courts to re-evaluate the evidence, in order to reach the conclusion that\n                      the award suffers from patent illegality. This is because courts do not sit\n                      in appeal against arbitral awards. When an arbitrator takes a view that is\n                      not even a possible one, or interprets a clause in the contract in such a\n                      manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would, or if an arbitrator\n                      commits an error of jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and\n                      dealing with matters that are not allotted to them, these are examples of\n                      situations in which it is permissible to interfere with a domestic award\n                      under Section 34(2-A) on the ground of patent illegality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">                      128. In addition to the above, the above mentioned principles state that\n                      the arbitral award is to contain reasons which are intelligible and\n                      adequate. Such reasons need not be elaborated, but must have three\n                      characteristics of being proper, intelligible, and adequate. If the challenge\n                      to an award is based on the ground that the same is unintelligible, the\n                      same would be equivalent to providing no reasons at all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">                      129. Moreover, an arbitral award that does not provide any explanations\n                      for its conclusions leaves itself open to legal scrutiny for the reasons\n                      given above. The arbitrator has reached certain perverse conclusions, and\n                      those conclusions, to the extent that they are based on no evidence or\n                      have been arrived at by ignoring essential evidence, can be set aside on\n                      the basis that they are obviously illegal. The practice of taking into\n                      account the evidence, that has not been made available to the opposite\n                      party is another example of the perversity that is encompassed by the\n                      term &#x27;patent illegality&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">                                                                                         Page 68 of 71</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">                      O.M.P.

This Court finds that the Arbitrator being the ultimate master of the\n                      Arbitration, can adjudicate the claims in a manner that is on the lines of\n                      basic tenets of law and the principles of natural justice and jurisprudence.\n                      As long as, the Award does not shock the conscience of the Court, it\n                      warrants no interference by the Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">                      131. The law which has been settled by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court is\n                      that the scope of interference with an Arbitral Award under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 34</a> of\n                      the Act, 1996 is fairly limited and narrow. The Courts shall not sit in an\n                      appeal while adjudicating a challenge to an Award which is passed by an\n                      Arbitrator, the master of evidence, after due consideration of facts,\n                      circumstances, evidence, and material before him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">                      132. It has been held in a catena of judgments of the Hon‟ble Supreme\n                      Court that, there is a legal presumption in favour of the Award being\n                      valid and the person challenging the Award has to make out one\n                      of the grounds enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 34(2)</a> of the Act, 1996. In\n                      pursuance of this, this Court is of the view that the learned Arbitral\n                      Tribunal in the instant case has considered the relevant contractual\n                      provisions and has passed the impugned Award as per the law.\n                      CONCLUSION\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">                      133. The petitioner has failed to corroborate the evidence as to how the\n                      learned Tribunal&#x27;s findings‟ regarding the Claims is patently illegal. The\n                      learned Tribunal has dealt with the Clauses in detail and has construed,\n                      and applied the same correctly while dealing with Claim Nos. 1, 2, 3 and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">                      4. Thus, the Award cannot be found faulted with, as no ground has been\n                      made out to set aside the impugned Award inasmuch as the threshold to\n                      interfere with in an arbitral award has not been made out.

It is a cardinal duty of the Constitutional Courts to adhere to this\n                      check on the powers of the court and always keep in mind that the\n                      Arbitral Award which has been passed by respecting the mandate of the\n                      disputing parties, should not be set aside unless and until it suffers from a\n                      grave error that shocks the entire conscience of the court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\">                      135. A perusal of the impugned Award makes it evident that there is no\n                      patent illegality or error apparent on the face of the record. The learned\n                      Arbitral Tribunal has passed the Award after considering all the relevant\n                      material placed before it during the arbitral proceedings. The impugned\n                      Award is well-reasoned and is not in contravention of the fundamental\n                      policy of Indian law, and thus there is no reason for interference by this\n                      Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_175\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167995364\" id=\"span_245\">136. Considering the factual matrix of the case, authorities cited,\n                      pleadings presented and arguments advanced, this court comes to the\n                      conclusion that the Arbitral Award dated 14th September 2022 passed by\n                      the learned Arbitral Tribunal in the matter titled as <a href=\"/doc/167995364/\" id=\"a_75\">„Tata Projects Ltd. v.\n                      NTPC Ltd.‟</a>, does not suffer from any infirmities and any kind of patent\n                      illegality that per se violates any law, that is fundamental in nature,\n                      enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 34</a> of the Act, 1996. The impugned Award is thus\n                      not patently illegal and neither in conflict with the public policy of India\n                      nor contrary to the terms of the Contract entered into between the\n                      petitioner and the respondent.
