I have already\n       interpreted the contract to see what is provided under the\n       Agreement. What is provided under the agreement has to be\n       adhered to by EBTL. The agreement specifically provides\n       that minimum draft should be 10 meter at the terminal and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                               Page 15 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n     maximum shall be permissible draft (i.e. 10 meter + tide). To\n     provide such draft as available is the reciprocal obligation of\n     EBTL against it charging MGT and Dollarization to AMNS.\n     EBTL cannot contend that though it will charge MGT and\n     Dollarization to AMNS but it will not honor its obligation\n     under the Agreement and will not provide requisite available\n     permissible draft.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">     18.2 I have already held for AMNS that one cannot ignore\n     the express terms of the contract under garb of dispute. The\n     same principle will apply for EBTL. What is good for the\n     goose is also good for the gander. Hence EBTL is obliged to\n     provide the draft as available at the terminal and it cannot\n     restrain the terminal draft at ceiling of 10 meter in\n     aberration to the terms of the Contract till the final dispute\n     and liability is adjudicated by Arbitral Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">     18.3 CHA specifically provides declaration of terminal draft.\n     Such declaration of terminal draft has to be based on tidal\n     forecast and other weather conditions.

We shall first take up the two First Appeals filed by the\nEBTL. The EBTL has raised two issues before this Court :                     (i)\nwhether the Commercial Court, in exercise of its power under\n<a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act, could have directed the EBTL to\nmaintain a depth in the channel of 10 meters below the chart\ndatum by way of an interim measure in favour of the AMNS ? In\nother words, whether the EBTL is obliged to : (a) maintain a\nminimum draft of 10 meters at the terminal and (b) also\nmaintain a minimum depth of 10 meters below the chart datum\nin the channel, and (ii) whether the Commercial Court was\njustified in directing the EBTL to continue to provide services\nwithout the AMNS required to pay the agreed &quot;Dollar Tariff&quot; ? In\nother words, whether the AMNS should have been directed to\nperform its continuing obligation to pay in accordance with the\nterms of the contract, more particularly, when it continues to\navail the services under the contract pending the arbitration. To\nput it more succinctly, the case put up on behalf of the EBTL is\nthat although the court below accepted that the AMNS is obliged\nto pay the dollarized tariff, yet it should not have granted the\nrelief to the AMNS by way of an interim measure saying that the\ndollarized tariff shall be paid using the USD exchange rate\nprevailing on 30th December 2020, as the base rate. The EBTL\nsays that the USD exchange rate as on 31 st April 2013 should\nhave been taken as the base rate.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                            Page 19 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                    Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">   C/FA/3040/2021                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n       AMNS&#x27;s APPEALS :\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">51.    So far as the two First Appeals filed by the AMNS is\nconcerned, it focuses only on the issue of USD denominated\ntariff. According to the AMNS, the court below should have\nallowed its application filed under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration\nAct, seeking an injunction against the EBTL from implementing\nthe Dollar Tariff. In other words, it is the case of the AMNS that\nin the application filed by the EBTL under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 9</a> of the\nArbitration Act, the court below ought not to have passed an\norder by way of an interim measure directing the AMNS to\ncontinue to pay the Dollar Tariff as it amounts to granting of\nspecific performance of an agreement. One appeal by the AMNS\nis against that part of the order by which the court declined to\ngrant the injunction by way of an interim measure against the\nEBTL from implementing the Dollar Tariff and the another is\nagainst the relief granted to the EBTL as regards the USD\nexchange rate as on 30th December 2020.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">       GIST OF THE AFORESAID :\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">52.    The AMNS has a huge steel manufacturing plant at Hazira\n(Surat). It requires huge quantity of iron ore for its steel\nmanufacturing plant. The iron ore in huge quantity is being\nimported from other countries. Everyday, hundreds of vessels\nreach at the Magdalla Port. The EBTL has constructed two Deep-\nWater jetties at the Magdalla Port. The EBTL manages the two\nDeep-Water jetties. The cargo imported by the AMNS is being\nunloaded at these jetties. The EBTL says that the only obligation\non their part is to maintain a minimum draft of 10 meters at the\nterminal and a minimum depth of 10 meters below the chart\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                            Page 20 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                    Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\ndatum in the channel. The AMNS says that it is the obligation of\nthe EBTL to maintain a channel depth of 10 meters at all times.\nIf the EBTL fails to maintain a channel depth of 10 meters at all\ntimes, then hundreds of vessels carrying the cargo may have to\nwait outside till the high tide as it is only during the high tide\nthat the vessels may be in a position to reach the jetties. If the\nEBTL maintains a channel depth of 10 meters at all times, then\nirrespective of the tide, the vessels can safely and freely get into\nthe jetties and the cargo can be unloaded. It is the case of the\nAMNS that the delay that may be caused for any vessel to reach\nthe jetty on account of the lapse on the part of the EBTL to\nmaintain a channel depth of 10 meters at all times would prove\nvery costly to the AMNS. On the other hand, the EBTL says that\nthe only obligation on their part is to maintain a minimum draft\nof 10 meters at the terminal.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_60\">53.    On the issue of dollarization of tariff, it appears that in\n2011 the parties had agreed that the cargo handling charges\nwould be in accordance with the INR tariff. By way of the\nprincipal agreement, the parties had initially agreed with respect\nto the rates at which the EBTL would handle the cargo of the\nAMNS, i.e. &#x27;the cargo handling charges&#x27; would be in accordance\nwith the agreed INR denominated tariff. In 2013, the parties\nagreed to move to a USD denominated tariff. This was pursuant\nto the request by the AMNS to the EBTL to amend the principal\nagreement and benchmarked the cargo handling charges in the\nUSD at a specifically agreed exchange rate. The Dollar Tariff was\neffective from 1st May 2013. The parties had agreed to suspend\nthe Dollar Tariff till the EBTL would draw loans in dollars. In\nDecember 2020, the EBTL drew the first tranche of dollar loans.\nThe AMNS took the stance that it would not pay the Dollar Tariff\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                             Page 21 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                     CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\nas the Third Amendment Agreement was quite &#x27;onerous&#x27;.

Mr.Mihir Joshi, the learned senior counsel for Nanavati\nAssociates         appearing   for     the     appellant-EBTL,         vehemently\nsubmitted that the Commercial Court could be said to have\ntravelled far beyond the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act\nwhile directing the EBTL to maintain a channel depth of 10\nmeters at all times. Mr.Joshi would submit that the only\nobligation on the part of his client is to maintain a minimum\ndepth of 10 meters at the terminal and a minimum depth of 10\nmeters below the chart datum in the channel. The former is an\nexpress obligation, which is indisputably being continuously\nperformed by the EBTL and not in controversy. Mr.Joshi would\nsubmit that the latter is purportedly an implied covenant, which\nis sought to be enforced by way of a mandatory direction in the\nform of an interim measure at the stage of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 9</a> of the\nArbitration Act. Mr.Joshi would submit that his client has no\nobligation, express or implied, to maintain any specific depth in\nthe channel.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_63\">55.    Mr.Joshi would submit that his client, after putting in lot\nof efforts and incurring lot of expenses, was able to reach a\ndepth of 12 meters below the chart datum in the channel. The\nAMNS was informed about the same and was also requested to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                     Page 22 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                             Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\npay the additional cargo handling charges of Rs.21=00 per MT\nescalated annually. According to Mr.Joshi, the AMNS doubted\nsuch claim put forward by his client as regards reaching the\ndepth of 12 meters below chart datum in the channel. The AMNS\ndeclined to pay the additional cargo handling charges of\nRs.21=00 per MT escalated annually.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">56.    Mr.Joshi would submit that his client ensures the AMNS\nthe depth in the channel as would allow the safe navigation of\nthe vessels with a 10 meters draft in furtherance of its clear and\nundisputed obligation to provide a minimum draft of 10 meters\nat the terminal. Mr.Joshi would submit that even the court\nbelow in its impugned order in para 9.2 has observed that,\n&quot;...when we peruse the CHA and SLA, then prima facie, I do not\nfind any such express clause imposing liability upon the EBTL to\nmaintain channel depth at 10 meter and also provide 24 x 7\naccess.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">57.    Mr.Joshi would submit that the impugned order also\nrecords in para 21.3 that, &quot;...there are no quantifiable data\navailable on record to show that vessels of even 10 meter draft of\nAMNS has not been serviced or that any of the vessels have\ngrounded or any other incident has happened.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_66\">58.    According to Mr.Joshi, in view of the aforesaid, the\nmandatory direction issued by the court below to his client to dig\nthe channel to a depth of 10 meters is erroneous in law and\nmore particularly without recording any finding on the issue of\nbalance of convenience.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                            Page 23 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                    Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_67\">   C/FA/3040/2021                                      CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">59.     Mr.Joshi would submit that the Deep-Water Jetties are in\nthe Tapi river estuary where the natural depth of the channel is\n0 (zero) meter. The channel as it stands today has been dredged\ncontinuously by the EBTL to facilitate the safe navigation of the\nvessels. Dredging the channel requires huge costs on a\ncontinuing basis given the continuous siltation patterns. In such\ncircumstances, the parties had agreed that the EBTL shall\nprovide a minimum draft of 10 meters to the vessels of the\nAMNS. If the AMNS submission that minimum draft of 10 meters\nis required to be read as an obligation on the EBTL to provide a\ndraft of more than 10 meters, then the obligation on the AMNS\nto provide &#x27;minimum&#x27; monthly cargo handling charges of 2.08\nmillion metric tonne set out in the Annexure I of the CHA 2011\nought to be read as an obligation on the AMNS to provide more\nthan just 25 million metric tonne of cargo per annum. This is\nclearly not what the parties intended under the contract. It is\nneither necessary nor reasonable under the CHA 2011 to imply a\ncovenant on the EBTL to provide depth of 10 meters below chart\ndatum in the channel.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">60.     Mr.Joshi would further submit that in the absence of any\nbenefits or identified prejudice to the AMNS (since all the vessels\nof 10 meters draft have anyway been continuously handled by\nthe EBTL), such an order to dredge to 10 meters below the chart\ndatum      in      the    channel   is    wasteful,     causes        unnecessary\nenvironment degradation, and requires irrecoverable cost to be\nincurred by the EBTL. He would submit that the mandatory\ndirection to maintain the channel depth at 10 meters below the\nchart    datum       is    prohibited    by     <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections     14(1)(b)</a>        and      <a href=\"/doc/685723/\" id=\"a_28\">39</a>\nrespectively of the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_29\">Specific Relief Act, 1963</a> (since the depth of\nthe channel reduces constantly, any such order imposes a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                    Page 24 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                              Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\ncontinuous obligation on the EBTL and would require constant\nmonitoring by the court) Thus, the EBTL ought not to have been\ndirected to maintain a depth of 10 meters below the chart datum\nin the channel.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">61.    On the issue of the agreed &#x27;Dollar Tariff&#x27;, we heard\nMr.S.N.Soparkar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the\nEBTL.      Mr.Soparkar   would   submit      that   the     court       below\ncommitted a serious error in modifying the express terms of the\ncontract by directing the payment of the Dollar Tariff at different\nrates. Mr.Soparkar would submit that the court below arbitrarily\ndirected that the rate of USD 3.6792 per tonne (in F.Y. 2020-21)\nmust be paid by the AMNS, which is altogether a different rate\nfrom the expressly agreed rate of USD 4.9575 per tonne (in F.Y.\n2020-21) recorded in the contract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">62.    Mr.Soparkar would submit that the case on hand is one\nwherein the EBTL and the AMNS have an express and\nunambiguous agreement on the tariff of USD 4.9575 per tonne\npayable as the cargo handling charges by the AMNS upon the\nfirst tranche of the dollar loans being drawn by the EBTL (Dollar\nTariff). The first tranche of the dollar loans was drawn in\nDecember 2020 and the EBTL intimated the AMNS that the\nagreed revised rate is now payable. The learned senior counsel\nwould submit that the AMNS defaulted in making the payment\nand instead went to the extent of filing an application under\n<a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act claiming that the agreed revised\ntariff is &#x27;onerous&#x27; and sought protection from the court below in\nthat regard.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                             Page 25 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">   C/FA/3040/2021                                    CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">63.    Mr.Soparkar would submit that the Commercial Court\nrightly rejected the claim of the AMNS by holding that the\nagreement was binding and the AMNS cannot be permitted to\nresile from its liability to honour the terms thereof. However,\nsaying so, the court re-wrote the fundamental and most material\nterm of the contract by changing the rate.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">64.    Mr.Soparkar would submit that the court below, under the\ngarb of &#x27;interpreting the contract&#x27;, directed the tariff conversion\ndate to be December 30, 2020 (which was USD 1 = INR 73),\nwhich       interpretation   is      different       from       the        common\nunderstanding and interpretation of both the AMNS and the\nEBTL. It is submitted that neither the pleadings nor the\ncontemporaneous        correspondence             between    the      contracting\nparties contemplates the interpretation of the agreed contractual\nterms as directed by the court below.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_50\">65.

Mr.Soparkar would submit that the supposed intention of\nthe parties declared by the court below is contrary to the\ndocuments and admissions on record. The same has not been\nasserted by either of the parties in the pleadings or arguments.\nThe same is irrational and contrary to the commercial prudence\nand reasonableness, and completely unsupported by the factual\nconspectus in the present case. Such an interpretation would\nmean that the AMNS had relinquished all control on the tariff to\nthe whims of the EBTL, since the EBTL could have drawn down\na small dollar loan on an opportunistic date (say when the\nexchange rate was at USD 1 = INR 45) and change the tariff\npayable by its unilateral action\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">69.    Mr.Soparkar would further submit that if the parties had\nintended to have the Dollar Tariff payable at an exchange rate\ndifferent from the one set out in the Third Amendment\nAgreement, the same would be material and would have been\nreflected in the Fourth Amendment Agreement.

Mr.Soparkar submitted that the court below, without any\nbasis or supported by any pleadings whatsoever, held that the\n&quot;intention of the parties was very specific to take the rate that\nwas prevailing on the date of coming into force the agreement.&quot;\nAccordingly, the court below directed payment of the Dollar\nTariff at the base exchange rate of December 30, 2020, resulting\nin the payment of approximately Rs.3 crore to the EBTL (as\nopposed to Rs.300 crore which the AMNS would have paid under\nthe contract). It is settled law that the Courts cannot grant reliefs\nwhich have neither been pleaded nor prayed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">71.    Mr.Soparkar would submit that the court below committed\na serious error while holding that even if the Third Amendment\nAgreement would not have been suspended and was still in\noperation, even in such a scenario there would be a revision of\nsuch RBI reference rate at regular intervals.

The most usual\n               inference in such a case is that nothing is to happen. If\n               the parties had intended something to happen, the\n               instrument would have said so. Otherwise, the\n               express provisions of the instrument are to continue to\n               operate undisturbed.

The Annexure III of the CHA (including the note provided\ntherein) provides for the discharge rate in MT of various cargo at\nHazira      Port   per    weather      working     day.     This       annexure\ncontemplates the coming in of cape sized and mini cape sized\nvessels. The draft of a cape size vessel is around 17 meters and\nthat of a mini cape size vessel is below 17 meters but above 13\nmeters.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">86.    Thus, according to Mr.Thakore, as per the CHA, there is an\nobligation on the EBTL to maintain a minimum terminal draft of\n10 meters at all times. However, this does not mean that the\nEBTL cannot provide a draft higher than 10 meters. The\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                  Page 35 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                          Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\nmaximum permissible draft at the Deep Water Berth shall be\nsubject to the approved depth by the NSPC. This is evident from\nthe Recital 2 of the Service Level Agreement which is as follows :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">       &quot;EBTL has guaranteed a minimum draft of 10 M. at its Deep\n       Draft Berth. The maximum permissible draft at Deep Water\n       Berth is subject to approved depth by Navigational Safety at\n       Ports Committee (NSPC) of the Govt. of India from time to\n       time.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">87.    The NSPC Certificate dated 28th February 2020 states that\nthe permissible draft is &quot;10 m. + tide&quot;.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">88.    Mr.Thakore submitted that if the provisions of the CHA,\nSLA and the NSPC Certificate are read together, it is evident that\nthe EBTL has undertaken that the minimum 10 meters terminal\ndraft will be available at all times (including at low tide) and a\nhigher draft will be made available as per tidal variations. This is\nsupported by Annexure III to the CHA, which contemplates the\ndischarge of cape sized and mini cape sized vessels with a\nminimum cargo load of 80,000 MT discharge rate per weather\nworking day on board. These vessels have a draft of much more\nthan 10 meters. The benefit of tide must necessarily be given,\nwhich is also supported by the stipulation in the SLA requiring\nthe EBTL to declare the projected draft for every month - these\nprojections take tidal variations into account.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">89.    The berthing capacity is at 10 m + tide. Therefore, a vessel\nhaving a terminal draft of minimum 10 m + tide can come in. In\norder for a vessel to reach the berth, it will have to pass through\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                             Page 36 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\nthe channel. So even a vessel with a higher draft than 10 meters\nshould be able to navigate through the channel and reach the\nberth. If the depth is kept at 7 meters, the navigation through\nthe channel will not be possible. Only a vessel of 10 meters draft\ncan pass through the navigation channel and that too only\nduring the high tide. It will not be possible for a vessel above 10\nmeters draft to navigate through the channel. Hence, given that\nthe term &#x27;port&#x27; includes jetty, channel and berth, the obligation\nto maintain minimum draft of 10 meters should be throughout\nthe port and not just at the berth.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_107\">90.    Mr.Thakore submitted that the contract must be read as a\nwhole. To say that the EBTL shall provide minimum draft of 10\nmeters would mean that a draft of 10 meters shall be available at\nthe terminal at all times. The obligation is to provide 10 m. + tide\ndraft. But a draft of 10 meters should be the minimum that is\nprovided to the AMNS.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">91.    In the impugned order, the Commercial Court passed the\nfollowing directions :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">       &quot;(18.1) AMNS has prayed that EBTl shall keep the terminal\n       draft and channel depth at 10 Meter. I have already\n       interpreted the contract to see what is provided under the\n       Agreement. What is provided under the agreement has to be\n       adhered to by EBTL. The agreement specifically provides\n       that minimum draft should be 10 meter at the terminal and\n       maximum shall be permissible draft (I.e. 10 meter + tide). To\n       provide such draft as available is the reciprocal obligation of\n       EBTL against it charging MGT and Dollarization to AMNS.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                               Page 37 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\"> C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n     EBTL cannot contend that though it will charge MGT and\n     Dollarization to AMNS but it will not honor its obligation\n     under the Agreement and will not provide requisite available\n     permissible draft.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">     (18.2) I have already held for AMNS that one cannot ignore\n     the express terms of the contract under garb of dispute. The\n     same principle will apply for EBTL. What is good for the\n     goose is also good for the gander. Hence EBTL is obliged to\n     provide the draft as available at the terminal and it cannot\n     restrain the terminal draft at ceiling of 10 meter in\n     aberration to the terms of the Contract till the final dispute\n     and liability is adjudicated by Arbitral Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">     (18.3) CHA specifically provides declaration of terminal\n     draft. Such declaration of terminal draft has to be based on\n     tidal forecast and other weather conditions. Hence it is\n     required that EBTL shall, based upon the tidal forecast as\n     published by GMB, determine and declare the available\n     terminal draft for every month and accordingly shall service\n     the vessels of the AMNS as per the CHA.

Mr.Thakore would submit that the court below cannot be\nsaid to have issued any mandatory order or injunction, but\nrather, could be said to have only directed the parties to comply\nwith the terms of the contract.

Mr.Khambhata      thereafter      proceeded      to      make          his\nsubmissions on merits on the issue of dollarization.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">102. Mr.Khambhata submitted that the Third Amendment\nAgreement and the Fourth Amendment Agreement are not\nenforceable, and in such circumstances, the AMNS is not obliged\nto pay the cargo handling charges in accordance with the USD\ndenominated tariff. Mr.Khambhata, with his usual fairness,\nsubmitted that this issue however may be decided by the arbitral\ntribunal. He would submit, without prejudice to his main\ncontention as regards the enforceability of the Third and the\nFourth Amendment Agreement, that if at all a dollarized tariff is\nto be paid, it should be calculated using the USD exchange rate\nprevailing on 30th December 2020 as the base rate. The claim of\nthe EBTL that the USD exchange rate as on 30 th April 2013\nshould be taken as the base rate is untenable in law. This,\naccording to Mr.Khambhata, is a matter of interpretation of\ncontract to subserve the explicit purpose and intent, i.e. to have\na natural hedge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">103. Mr.Khambhata would submit that pursuant to the 4 th\nAmendment Agreement, the amendment effective date came to\nbe shifted to the date on which the EBTL drew its first tranche of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                            Page 43 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                    Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                       CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\nborrowings in the USD. In such circumstances, the date 30 th\nApril 2013 could be said to have lost its significance. Since the\nEBTL drew its first tranche of the borrowings in the USD only on\n31st December 2020, the amendment effective date, if any,\nshould      be     30th    December      2020.       Therefore,      according          to\nMr.Khambhata, even if the AMNS is obliged to pay the dollarized\ntariff, which it denies, but in any case it should be calculated\nusing the USD exchange rate as on 30 th December 2020.\nAccording to Mr.Khambhata, if it is not calculated using the USD\nexchange rate as on 30th December 2020, then the Third\nAmendment Agreement would cease to operate as a natural\nhedge and would result in a windfall profit for one of the parties\nbased on the changing exchange rate.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">104. The         learned    senior    counsel        would    submit        that      the\nCommercial Court adopted a balanced approach by directing the\nAMNS to pay the dollarized tariff in accordance with the RBI\nexchange rate prevailing on 30th April 2013. The Commercial\nCourt rightly took such a view considering that the object of the\nThird Amendment Agreement was to provide a natural hedge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_124\">105. The learned senior counsel submitted that the Commercial\nCourt is also right in observing that if the rate of 30 th April 2013\nis to be considered for calculating the dollarized tariff, the same\nwould be a bonanza of INR 300 crore per year for the EBTL at\nthe cost of the AMNS, which would run contrary to the very\nconcept of hedging.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"10332596\" id=\"span_93\">106.

Mr.Khambhata also took us through the\nobservations made by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/10332596/\" id=\"a_74\">Nabha\nPower Ltd.</a> (supra), more particularly, paragraph 44 therein.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">107. Mr.Khambhata, the learned senior counsel pointed out\nthat his client, i.e. the AMNS, has also preferred two First\nAppeals being First Appeals Nos.3506 of 2021 and 3507 of 2021\nrespectively. Both these appeals are directed against that part of\nthe order of the Commercial Court, where the Commercial Court\ndirected his client to pay the disputed dollarized minimum\nmonthly charges.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_127\">108. Mr.Khambhata would submit that in doing the aforesaid,\nthe Commercial Court has in effect could be said to have granted\nspecific     performance   of   the     contract    in     the      <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_75\">Section        9</a>\nproceedings. He would submit that the court, exercising powers\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act, is not to enforce the\ncontract since the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 9</a> are neither the\nproceedings arising out of a contract nor a suit. <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 9</a>\nempowers the court only to issue orders to preserve the subject\nmatter of arbitration till the arbitral tribunal has an occasion to\nadjudicate the matter; and that if the courts, in exercise of\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 9</a>, start enforcing the terms of the\ncontract, it would frustrate the very concept of arbitration, where\nthe parties choose to have their disputes adjudicated, instead of\nby the courts, by arbitrators of their choice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">109. Mr.Khambhata would submit that the AMNS disputes its\nliability to pay the minimum monthly charges and the dollarized\ncargo handling charges.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                Page 45 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                         Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">110. In such circumstances <a href=\"/doc/10332596/\" id=\"a_80\">referred to above</a>, Mr.Khambhata\nprays that both the First Appeals filed by his client may be\nallowed and the order passed by the Commercial Court to the\nextent it has caused serious prejudice to his client may be\nquashed and set-aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">       ANALYSIS :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">111.

The expression &#x27;etc.&#x27;, used at the\nend of a definition clause has been held, in several decisions, to\nbe required to be interpreted noscitur a sociis and ejusdem\ngeneris (the latter principle applying where the words, preceding\nthe word &#x27;etc.&#x27;, constituted a genus, and the former principle\napplying more universally, in all cases), the words preceding it.\nThe measures put in place by the court, in exercise of the\njurisdiction vested by <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 9</a> has, therefore, to be in the\nnature of &#x27;interim measures&#x27;.

The court, while exercising its power under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 9</a> of the\nArbitration Act, has to be fully conscious of the power, vested in\nthe arbitrator/arbitral tribunal, by <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 17</a> of the same Act. A\nreading of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_86\">Sections 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_87\">17</a> respectively of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_88\">Arbitration Act</a>,\nreveals that they are identically worded. The &#x27;interim measures&#x27;,\nwhich can be ordered by the arbitral tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 17</a>\nare the very same as those which can be ordered by the court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 9</a>. It is for this reason that sub-section (3) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 9</a> prescribes grant of interim measures, by the court,\nconsequent on constitution of the arbitral tribunal, save and\nexcept where the court finds that the circumstances exist, which\nmay not render the remedy, under <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 17</a>, to be efficacious.\nThe court, while exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 9</a>, even at\na pre-arbitration stage, cannot, therefore, usurp the jurisdiction\nwhich would, otherwise, be vested in the arbitrator, or the\narbitral tribunal, yet to be constituted. The court is also required\nto ensure that <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 9</a> is not employed, by litigants, who feel\nthat it is easier to obtain interim relief from a court, rather than\nfrom an arbitrator or arbitral tribunal, to forum shop. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"952082\" id=\"span_101\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1102476\" id=\"span_102\">If left\nunchecked, <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 9</a> is easily amenable to such misuse. While,\nin an appropriate case, the court must not hesitate in ordering\n&#x27;interim measures&#x27;, under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 9</a>, in judging whether a\nparticular case is &#x27;appropriate&#x27; or not, the court is required to do\nsome tightrope walking. The principles, to be borne in mind,\nwhile examining whether a case has been made out for the grant\nof interim measures, under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 9</a>, are the existence of a\nprima facie case, the balance of convenience and the possibility\nof irreparable loss or prejudice, if the interim relief was to be\ndeclined, apart from the consideration of public interest.

However, it is important to state that the mere satisfaction\nof these criteria does not, ipso facto, make out a case for ordering\ninterim measures under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 9</a>. Additionally, the court is also\nrequired to satisfy itself that the relief, being sought under\n<a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 9</a>, cannot await the constitution of the arbitral tribunal,\nor the appointment of the arbitrator, and the invocation, before\nsuch arbitrator or arbitral tribunal, of <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 17</a>. Emergent\nnecessity, of ordering interim measures is, therefore, an\nadditional sine qua non, to be satisfied before the court proceeds\nto grant relief under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act. While\npassing orders under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 9</a>, therefore, the court is required\nto satisfy itself that (i) the applicant, before it, manifestly intends\nto initiate arbitral proceedings, <a href=\"/doc/507484/\" id=\"a_105\">Sundaram Finance Ltd vs. NEPC\nIndia Ltd</a>, 1999 2 SCC 479, (ii) the criteria for grant of interim\ninjunction, which apply to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_106\">Order 39 of the CPC</a>, stands satisfied,\nand (iii) circumstances also exist, which renders the requirement\nof ordering interim measures an emergent necessity, which\ncannot await a <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 17</a> proceeding, before the arbitrator, or\narbitral tribunal. In assessing whether such an emergent\nnecessity exists, or not, the court would, essentially, have to\nsatisfy itself that failure to order interim measures, under\n<a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 9</a>, would frustrate, or would render the recourse, to\narbitration - which is yet to take place - a futility.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">115. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1847057\" id=\"span_106\">In <a href=\"/doc/1847057/\" id=\"a_109\">Adhunik Steels Ltd vs. Orissa Manganese and Minerals\n(P) Ltd</a>, (2007) 7 SCC 125, the Supreme Court examined, in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                               Page 48 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                  CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\ndetail, the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act.

In the combination of\n             circumstances which we find in the present case I\n             would have hesitated long before proposing that such\n             an order should be made, even if the action had been\n             destined to remain in the High Court.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">     21. It is true that the intention behind <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 9</a> of the Act is\n     the issuance of an order for preservation of the subject-\n     matter of an arbitration agreement. According to learned\n     counsel for Adhunik Steels, the subject-matter of the\n     arbitration agreement in the case on hand, is the mining and\n     lifting of ore by it from the mines leased to OMM Private\n     Limited for a period of 10 years and its attempted abrupt\n     termination by OMM Private Limited and the dispute before\n     the arbitrator would be the effect of the agreement and the\n     right of OMM Private Limited to terminate it prematurely in\n     the circumstances of the case. So viewed, it was open to the\n     court to pass an order by way of an interim measure of\n     protection that the existing arrangement under the contract\n     should be continued pending the resolution of the dispute by\n     the arbitrator. May be, there is some force in this submission\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                               Page 51 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n       made on behalf of Adhunik Steels. But, at the same time,\n       whether an interim measure permitting Adhunik Steels to\n       carry on the mining operations, an extraordinary measure in\n       itself in the face of the attempted termination of the contract\n       by OMM Private Limited or the termination of the contract by\n       OMM Private Limited, could be granted or not, would again\n       lead the court to a consideration of the classical rules for the\n       grant of such an interim measure. Whether an interim\n       mandatory       injunction     could         be   granted       directing        the\n       continuance of the working of the contract, had to be\n       considered in the light of the well-settled principles in that\n       behalf. Similarly, whether the attempted termination could\n       be restrained leaving the consequences thereof vague would\n       also be a question that might have to be considered in the\n       context of well-settled principles for the grant of an\n       injunction. Therefore, on the whole, we feel that it would not\n       be correct to say that the power under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 9</a> of the Act is\n       totally independent of the well-known principles governing\n       the grant of an interim injunction that generally govern the\n       courts in this connection. So viewed, we have necessarily to\n       see whether the High Court was justified in refusing the\n       interim injunction on the facts and in the circumstances of\n       the case.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">116. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"122362\" id=\"span_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1169432\" id=\"span_116\">In       <a href=\"/doc/1169432/\" id=\"a_113\">Arvind    Constructions           Ltd       vs.     Kalinga         Mining\nCorporation</a>, (2007) 6 SCC 798, the Supreme Court reiterated\nthe principle that the exercise of jurisdiction, under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 9</a> of\nthe Arbitration Act, is subject to the restrictions and limitations\ncontained in the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_115\">Specific Relief Act</a>, while <a href=\"/doc/122362/\" id=\"a_116\">Firm Ashok Traders vs.\nGurmukh Das Saluja</a>, (2004) 3 SCC 155, also holds - as did\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                    Page 52 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                                                 Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\nAdhunik Steels Ltd, (1997) 1 SCC 134, two years later - that &quot;the\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 9</a> is only formulating interim measures so\nas to protect the right under adjudication before the Arbitral\nTribunal from being frustrated&quot;.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"521759\" id=\"span_119\">117.

The Court&#x27;s discretion ought to\n       be exercised in those exceptional cases where there is\n       adequate material on record, leading to a definite conclusion\n       that the respondent is likely to render the entire arbitration\n       proceedings infructuous, by frittering away the properties of\n       funds either before or during the pendency of arbitration\n       proceedings or even during the interregnum period from the\n       date of award and its execution.

The 2015 Amendment also\n       introduces a deeming fiction, whereby an order passed by\n       the Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 17</a> is deemed to be an\n       order of Court for all purposes and is enforceable as an\n       order of Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">       68. With the law as it stands today, the Arbitral Tribunal\n       has the same power to grant interim relief as the Court and\n       the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 17</a> is as efficacious as the remedy\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 9(1)</a>. There is, therefore, no reason why the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                               Page 65 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n     Court should continue to take up applications for interim\n     relief, once the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted and is in\n     seisin of the dispute between the parties, unless there is\n     some impediment in approaching the Arbitral Tribunal, or\n     the interim relief sought cannot expeditiously be obtained\n     from the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">     93. It is now well settled that the expression &quot;entertain&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_179\">     means to consider by application of mind to the issues\n     raised. The Court entertains a case when it takes a matter\n     up for consideration. The process of consideration could\n     continue till the pronouncement of judgment as argued by\n     Khambata. Once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted the\n     Court cannot take up an application under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 9</a> for\n     consideration, unless the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 17</a> is\n     inefficacious. However, once an application is entertained in\n     the sense it is taken up for consideration, and the Court has\n     applied its mind to the Court can certainly proceed to\n     adjudicate the application.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">     95. On a combined reading of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 9</a> with <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 17</a> of\n     the Arbitration Act, once an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted,\n     the Court would not entertain and/or in other words take up\n     for consideration and apply its mind to an application for\n     interim measure, unless the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 17</a> is\n     inefficacious, even though the application may have been\n     filed before the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. The bar\n     of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_196\">Section 9(3)</a> would not operate, once an application has\n     been entertained and taken up for consideration, as in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                             Page 66 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n       instant case, where hearing has been concluded and\n       judgment has been reserved...\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">       96. Even after an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted, there may\n       be myriads of reasons why the Arbitral Tribunal may not be\n       an efficacious alternative to <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 9(1)</a>. This could even be\n       by reason of temporary unavailability of any one of the\n       Arbitrators of an Arbitral Tribunal by reason of illness, travel\n       etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">       101. As pointed out by Mr. Khambata, the 246 th Report of\n       the Law Commission, submitted in August 2014 states that\n       <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 9(3)</a> seeks to reduce the role of the Court in relation\n       to grant of interim measure, once the Arbitral Tribunal has\n       been constituted. This is also in keeping with the UNCITRAL\n       Model Law which discourages Court proceedings in relation\n       to disputes arising out of an agreement which contains a\n       clause for arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"183020218\" id=\"span_152\">102.

It is the case of the AMNS that the explicit intent and\nbusiness sense underlying the Third Amendment Agreement was\nto create a &#x27;natural hedge&#x27; for the parties. Clause (c) provides as\nunder :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">       &quot;(c) The prices of raw materials and finished goods produced\n       by ESTL is determined by international markets and these\n       prices are benchmarked in US Dollars. Further, majority of\n       the input costs of ESTL will continue to be benchmarked in\n       US Dollars. In order to have a natural hedge, ESTL proposes\n       that majority of its expenses be converted into US Dollar\n       denominated expenses.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">       A natural hedge, by definition :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">       &quot;Is a risk mitigation technique that involves investing in\n       asset pairings that are negatively correlated. Natural\n       hedges also occur through the normal course of business; for\n       example, a company that conducts operations in another\n       country will have minimal currency risk, because cash\n       inflows and outflows are in the same currency. This means\n       that a firm might set up supply chains within the country in\n       which it produces and sells goods, so that currency risk is\n       largely avoided. Otherwise, if it only sold into that country\n       but had operations elsewhere, then it would be exposed to\n       currency risk when repatriating the cash back to corporate\n       headquarters.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                              Page 68 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                                      Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_188\">   C/FA/3040/2021                                          CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_189\">134. Further, &quot;(a) natural hedge can also be implemented when\ninstitutions       exploit    their   normal          operating    procedures.           For\nexample, if they incur expenses in the same currency that their\nrevenues are generated they will actually reduce their exchange\nrate risk exposure, naturally&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">135. Mr.Khambhata is right in a way that being a risk\nmitigating mechanism, a natural hedge can never be an\narrangement where one party earns a bonanza at the cost of\nanother party. A natural hedge under which the EBTL received\npayments as per the USD denominated tariff would nullify its\nexposure to repay the loan at an additional amount owing to the\nfluctuation in the USD to INR rate.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">136. The above has been confirmed by the Reserve Bank of\nIndia, which defines a natural hedge as :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">       &quot;Natural hedge, in lieu of financial hedge, will be considered\n       only        to   the     extent     of     offsetting       projected           cash\n       flows/revenues in matching currency, net of all other\n       projected outflows. For this purpose, an ECB may be\n       considered naturally hedged if the offsetting exposure has\n       the maturity/cash flow within the same accounting year.\n       Any other arrangements/structures, where revenues are\n       indexed to foreign currency will not be considered as natural\n       hedge.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">137. The Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s definition and its emphasis on\nthe &#x27;same accounting year&#x27; confirms that, a natural hedge cannot\nbe interpreted to mean that, it would enable a party to gain a\nbonanza owing to the foreign exchange fluctuations.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                      Page 69 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                                                  Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_193\">   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n       SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE AMNS IN THE FIRST\n       APPEALS NOS.3506 AND 3506 OF 2021 RESPECTIVELY :\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_194\">138.

We propose to deal with the issue of Dollar Tariff first as\nmuch is not required to be said at our end in this regard. On\nplain reading of the impugned judgment and order, it appears to\nus that the Commercial Court, while granting the relief in favour\nof the parties, has indeed decided the entire dispute by himself\nand nothing is left for the decision to be taken by the arbitral\ntribunal that has already been constituted. It is true that at\ntimes it may not be impermissible for the court to come to the\nprima facie finding for granting relief which may result in the\nfinal decision in arbitration or suit or substantive proceeding.\nHowever, the substantive dispute between the parties is to be\ndecided in arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">140. On 21st February 2011, the EBTL and the ESIL entered\ninto a cargo handling agreement. The CHA provides, inter alia,\nfor the obligations in respect of the handling, loading and\nunloading of cargo related to the operations of the steel plant\noperated by the ESIL and the port related services/facilities to be\nprovided by the EBTL. The record reveals that the CHA was\nthereafter amended for seven times. Subsequently, on 7 th May\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                             Page 70 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n2013, the CHA was amended by way of the Third Amendment\nAgreement. By way of this amendment, the cargo handling\ncharges payable to the EBTL under clause 5.2 of the CHA was\nagreed to be determined as per USD denominated tariff of USD 1\n= INR 54.2190 (i.e. the RBI Reference Closing Rate as on 30 th\nApril 2013). The objective of the Third Amendment Agreement\nhas been provided in the Recital (c) read with Recital (d) which\nprovide as under :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">       &quot;(c) The prices of raw materials and finished goods produced\n       by ESTL is determined by international markets and these\n       prices are benchmarked in US Dollars.

On 15th October 2013, the CHA was further amended by\nway of the Fourth Amendment Agreement. This amendment\nclarified the applicability of the Third Amendment Agreement. It\nwas agreed that the Third Amendment Agreement shall be\neffective only after the EBTL draws its first tranche of borrowings\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                             Page 71 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\nin the USD. Until such time, the cargo handling charges payable\nto the EBTL shall be determined in Indian rupees.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\">143. On 16th December 2019, the AMNS took over the\noperations of the ESIL whereby the ESIL and the EBTL ceased to\nbe a part of the same group of companies, i.e. the ESSAR Group.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_201\">144. The stance of the AMNS before the Commercial Court was\nthat    the        Third   Amendment     Agreement      and      the      Fourth\nAmendment Agreement are not enforceable, and in such\ncircumstances, the AMNS is not required to pay the cargo\nhandling charges as per the USD denominated rates.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\">145. It appears that the Commercial Court, in para 11.5 of the\nimpugned order, made a passing observation that there is some\nweight in the challenge made by the AMNS to the Third and the\nFourth Amendment Agreements. The Commercial Court appears\nto have taken a balanced view in this regard. It declined to grant\nthe relief as prayed for by the AMNS in their <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 9</a>\napplication as regards the very enforceability of the Third and\nthe Fourth Amendment Agreements, and at the same time,\ndirected the AMNS to pay the cargo handling charges as per the\nUSD denominated rates prevailing on 30 th December 2020 as the\nbase rate.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">146. The EBTL is aggrieved by such relief granted in favour of\nthe AMNS as the EBTL asserts that the AMNS should have been\nasked to make the payment as per the USD exchange rate as on\n30th April 2013 and also the payment towards the defaulted\namount of Rs.40.89 crore along with interest being the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                 Page 72 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                                         Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\napplicable cargo handling charges payable under the CHA as\namended by the Third and the Fourth Amendment Agreements.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_204\">147. If the Commercial Court would have straightway said that\nthe Third and the Fourth Amendment Agreements are not\nenforceable being onerous, the same would have rendered its\norder vulnerable as it would amount to granting a substantive\nrelief and not as an interim measure.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"188979765\" id=\"span_166\">148. In exercise of the powers under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration\nAct, the court concerned is not empowered to adjudicate the\nsubstantive dispute between the parties. The said substantive\ndispute is to be decided in arbitration. This vital difference is to\nbe kept in mind while exercising the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 9</a>\ninasmuch as, as rightly pointed out by the Delhi High court in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/188979765/\" id=\"a_209\">CRSC Research and Design Institute Group Co. Ltd.</a>\n(supra) that any interpretation given by the court to the terms of\nthe contract, even though may be said to be on a prima facie\nview of the matter, may have a potential of influencing the\narbitral tribunal.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">149. In the aforesaid context, the only short point for our\nconsideration is, whether we should interfere with the relief\ngranted by the Commercial Court in favour of the AMNS so far\nas the USD exchange rate prevailing on a particular date is\nconcerned. Obviously, if the AMNS has been asked to make the\npayment as per the USD exchange rate as on 30 th December\n2020, it would suffer a financial loss. However, is this loss which\nthe EBTL may have to suffer would be in the form of an\nirreparable injury which cannot be compensated in terms of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                             Page 73 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\nmoney at any point of time ? Is it something which the arbitral\ntribunal would not be in a position to look into and grant an\nappropriate relief ?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">150. It is rather elementary that in the matters of grant of\ninterim relief, the satisfaction of the court only about the\nexistence of prima facie case in favour of the suitor is not\nenough. The other elements, i.e. balance of convenience and\nlikelihood of irreparable injury, are not of empty formality and\ncarry their own relevance; and while exercising its discretion in\nthe matter of interim relief and adopting a particular course, the\ncourt needs to weigh the risk of injustice, if ultimately the\ndecision of the main matter runs counter to the course being\nadopted at the time of granting or refusing the interim relief. We\nmay usefully refer to the relevant principle stated in the decision\nof Chancery Division in Films Rover International Ltd. and\nothers vs. Cannon Film Sales Ltd., (1986) 3 All ER 772 as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">       &quot;....The principal dilemma about the grant of interlocutory\n       injunctions, whether prohibitory or mandatory, is that there\n       is by definition a risk that the court may make the &quot;wrong&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">       decision, in the sense of granting an injunction to a party\n       who fails to establish his right at the trial (or would fail if\n       there was a trial) or alternatively, in failing to grant an\n       injunction to a party who succeeds (or would succeed) at\n       trial. A fundamental principle is therefore that the\n       court should take whichever course appears to carry\n       the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have\n       been &quot;wrong&quot; in the sense I have described.

In the\nlitigation before the Calcutta High Court, there was an\nagreement between the parties and on the basis thereof the\nappellant therein had agreed and declared that he would not sell\nor otherwise part with or dispose of any manganese and iron ore\nfrom the mine and the buyer being the respondent therein and\nthe plaintiff in the suit, would be the sole and the only buyer of\nall the manganese and iron ore from the mine during the\ncontinuance of the agreement. The learned counsel appearing for\nthe defendant drew the attention of the court to the factum of\nthe rates as mentioned in the agreement and submitted that the\nrates were so inexplicably low that those cannot termed to be an\nunconscionable bargain which the Law Court ought not to have\nenforced and the parties cannot possibly be ad idem on that\nscore and the agreement thus cannot be declared to be valid. It\nwas further argued that there was a negative covenant, which\notherwise was unenforceable and the question of directing the\nspecific performance of the contract would not arise. It was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                                Page 76 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                                        Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                                      CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\nargued that the grant of the interim order of injunction by the\nlearned Single Judge would unmistakably lead to the conclusion\nthat the agreement had been given effect to without the suit\nbeing decreed.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">153. The Division Bench proceeded in its order that the\nsubmission canvassed on behalf of the defendant had some\nforce, but on a closure scrutiny, the same failed to withstand in\nthe test of being substantive. The court took notice of the fact\nthat there was written agreement between the parties and as a\nmatter one of the clauses of the agreement it envisaged grant of\na mining lease in favour of the respondent therein. The Division\nBench was looking into the legality and validity of the order\npassed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court granting the\ninjunction. While dismissing the application for stay of the order\npassed by the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench observed\nas under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">       &quot;12. It is true that the learned Trial Judge has passed an ad\n       interim order of injunction and there is some amount of\n       sufferance so far as the appellant is concerned, but does\n       that negate an agreement in writing? We are afraid that at\n       this interlocutory stage of the proceedings, we are not in a\n       position to go into the same.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">       13. In any event, as regards the onerous term, Explanation\n       to <a href=\"/doc/1009821/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 20</a> of the Specific Relief Act, makes the position\n       clear.

Be it recorded that we are not expressing any opinion at\n     this stage of the proceedings and the matter is left to be\n     decided by the Learned Trial Judge, at the time of final\n     disposal of the suit and at this interlocutory stage of the\n     proceedings question of interventions of this Appellate Court\n     or to entertain an appeal or grant an interim order on the\n     basis of submission of the appellant that the agreement is\n     onerous does not and cannot arise.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">     15. In this context the observation of the House of Lords in\n     the case of White and Carter (Councils) Ltd. v. McGregor,\n     1962 AC 413, seems to be very apposite. The House of\n     Lords observed : &quot;it may be unfortunate that the appellants\n     have saddled themselves with an unwanted contract\n     causing an apparent waste of time and money. No doubt\n     this aspect impressed the Court of Session, but there is no\n     equity which can assist the appellant. It is trite that equity\n     will not rewrite an improvident contract where there is no\n     disability on either side.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_215\">     16. Admittedly there is no disability in the facts of this\n     matter under consideration, neither there is any pleading or\n     submission to that effect.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">     17. Turning attention on to Mr. Mitter&#x27;s further contention\n     viz. issue of balance of convenience, it is to be noted that the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                              Page 78 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                                      Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n       Court shall lean in favour of introduction of the concept of\n       balance of convenience, but does not mean and imply that\n       the balance would be on one side and not in favour of the\n       other. There must be proper balance between the parties\n       and the balance cannot be an one-sided affair.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">       18. On the factual score as above, can it be said that the\n       agreement between the parties unmistakably depicts an\n       unfair advantage in favour of the respondent? The answer,\n       on the basis of the observations of the House of Lords,\n       cannot but be in the negative. A sum of 15 lacs has been\n       paid on account of the consideration money and as such,\n       question of reduction in price cannot be stated that to be\n       that onerous so as to prompt the Appellate Court to\n       intervene at the interlocutory stage of the proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">       19. Insofar as their issue of negative covenant is concerned,\n       the same cannot, in our view, be decided at this stage of the\n       proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">       20. As regards the forum convenience clause, be it noted\n       here that the agreement specifically provides the same and\n       as such it is too early to record our views in that regard.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">154. In keeping with the above referred principles, one of the\nsimple questions to be adverted to at the threshold in the\npresent litigation is, whether the EBTL is likely to suffer\nirreparable injury in case they are paid as per the USD exchange\nrate prevailing on 30th December 2020.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                               Page 79 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_221\">   C/FA/3040/2021                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_222\">155. The answer, in our view, has to be in the negative. The\narbitral tribunal, in the course of the arbitral proceedings, will be\nlooking into the issue as regards the enforceability of the Third\nand the Fourth Amendment Agreements. The arbitral tribunal\nwould also be looking into the core issue, whether the AMNS\nshould continue to pay the USD exchange rate prevailing on 30 th\nDecember 2020 on the principle of natural hedge. All larger\nissues in this regard will have to be gone into by the arbitral\ntribunal and the parties would ultimately be governed by the\nfinal award that may be passed having regard to the nature of\nthe evidence that may be led by the parties before the arbitral\ntribunal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_223\">156. In such circumstances, we are of the view that the appeals\nof both, the EBTL as well as the AMNS, on the issue of the Dollar\nTariff should fail.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_224\">157. We now proceed to consider the issue with respect to the\nterminal draft and the channel depth. We propose to look into\nthis issue by posing a question to be answered by us, whether\nthere is anything to indicate that till the point of time the AMNS\nfiled the <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 9</a> application the EBTL was maintaining a\nchannel depth of 10 meters below the chart datum ? Is it the\ncase that all of a sudden the EBTL stopped maintaining the\nchannel depth, which put the AMNS in difficulty so far as the\nberthing of the cape sized and mini cape sized vessels are\nconcerned ? Although a faint attempt was made by Mr.Thakore\nto indicate that the EBTL was maintaining a channel depth of 10\nmeters below the chart datum based on some data available on\nrecord, yet it is difficult for this Court to say anything in this\nregard.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                              Page 80 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                                      Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_225\">   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">158. We are of the view that the relief granted by the\nCommercial Court by way of an interim measure in favour of the\nAMNS directing the EBTL to provide and maintain a channel\ndepth of 10 meters below the chart datum for all times overlooks\nthe concept of balance of convenience. Whether there is an\nobligation, express or implied, to maintain any specific depth in\nthe channel, would be a substantive issue that will have to be\nlooked into by the arbitral tribunal. However, by way of an\ninterim measure to direct the EBTL to keep dredging the channel\ncontinuously is something which could not have been granted by\nway of an interim measure. This relief in favour of the AMNS\nmay be to its benefit, but at the same time, the court should also\nhave considered the hardships that the EBTL may have to face\nin complying with such interim measures. The Commercial\nCourt should have looked into this particular issue having\nregard to the balance of convenience. It appears that the\nCommercial Court got persuaded by some prima facie case made\nout by the AMNS, but mere prima facie case by itself is not\nsufficient to grant any relief by way of an interim measure in\nexercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act. The\ncourt must be satisfied that the comparative mischief, hardships\nor the inconvenience which is likely to be caused to the applicant\nby refusing the relief prayed for will be greater than that which is\nlikely to be caused to the opposite party by granting it. The court\nowed a duty to consider the convenience of the EBTL as against\nthe convenience of the AMNS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">159.

The relief which has been granted by the court below in\nfavour of the AMNS prima facie runs contrary to the finding\nrecorded by the court that 10 meters draft vessels are being\nserviced. The relevant extract of the impugned order in this\nregard reads thus :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">       &quot;...With respect I am not able to concur with the arguments\n       of Ld. Sr. Counsel Mr. Khambata. First of all there cannot be\n       theoretical enforcement of a Contract. The obligation to\n       provide minimum 10 Meter draft at the berth 24X7 cannot\n       be interpreted to mean that even if for one minute the draft\n       is not 10 meter that would constitute breach of agreement.\n       Secondly, in absence of quantifiable data to show that\n       vessels of AMNS were not serviced by EBTL, especially in\n       light of data showing that over 140 ships of AMNS were\n       services by EBTL over couple of months, the argument of Ld.\n       Sr.Counsel sans merits. Thirdly as rightly argued and\n       pointed out by Ld. Sr. Counsel Mr. SIBAL no notice of breach\n       has been served by AMNS upon EBTL in this regards\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                              Page 82 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                                                      Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n       alleging that EBTL has not been servicing the vessels of\n       AMNS....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">161. It may not be out of place to state at this stage that the\nAMNS wants the EBTL to maintain a channel depth of 10 meters\nat all times, but when the EBTL called upon the AMNS to pay\nthe additional cargo handling charges @ Rs.21/- per MT, it\ndoubted the intimation of the EBTL made to the AMNS that it\nhas increased the depth of the channel from the existing 10\nmeters below the chart datum to 12 meters. Prima facie, it\nappears from the CHA, SLA and the NSP Certificate that the\nEBTL undertook to maintain a minimum 10 meters terminal\ndraft at all times (including at low tide) and a higher draft\nsubject to the tidal variations.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">162. Mr.Thakore is not right in his submission that the court\nbelow has not issued any mandatory direction but has only\ndirected the parties to comply with the terms of the contract. On\nwhat basis the AMNS says that the court below has only directed\nthe parties to comply with the terms of the contract ? It says so\non the basis of the Annexure-I of the CHA which provides as\nfollows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">       &quot;EBTL is increasing the depth of the channel from existing\n       10 meter below chart datum (CD) to 12 meter. After\n       increasing the depth of channel to 12 meter the cargo\n       handling charges for Raw Material will increase by Rs.21/-\n       per MT.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_231\">163. On the basis of the above, the AMNS asserts that when the\nCHA was entered into, there was an assurance to maintain a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                              Page 83 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                                      Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\n\ndepth of 10 meters in the channel at all times. The AMNS\nassumes that the CHA was entered into on the premise that a\nminimum channel depth of 10 meters would be available and\nmaintained by the EBTL at all times. We are of the view that all\nthese issues will have to be gone into by the arbitral tribunal,\nbut at the same time, we are sure of one thing that the court\nbelow should not have directed the EBTL to maintain a channel\ndepth of 10 meters below the chart datum at all times by way of\nan interim measure so as to facilitate the cape sized and the\nmini cape sized vessels to berth safely.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">164. Mr.Joshi is right in his submission that all that the AMNS\nprayed in their <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 9</a> application was that the channel depth\nbe maintained on the same level as on 10 th January 2021.\nMr.Joshi pointed out that the depth in the navigation channel as\non 10th January 2021 was not 10 meters below the chart datum.\nIn such circumstances, the Commercial Court could be said to\nhave exceeded its jurisdiction by directing the EBTL to maintain\na channel depth of 10 meters at all times.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_233\">165. The source of power of the court to make orders by way of\nan interim measure is only in <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act\nand there is no independent power de hors that provision. The\npower under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 9</a>, however, is not unbridled. It is subject to\ncertain limitations and restrictions, such as, first, it can be\nexercised by the court to some extent and in the same manner\nas it could for the purpose of in relation to any proceeding before\nit, and secondly, the exercise of the power to make interim\narrangements should not militate against any power which\nmight be vested in an arbitral tribunal. The interim measures\nwhich a court may be requested by a party to take are detailed in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                             Page 84 of 92</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Feb 03 21:01:37 IST 2022</span>\n   C/FA/3040/2021                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 03/02/2022\n\n\n\nsub-clauses (a) to (e) of clause (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 9</a>. Similar measures\nwere given in paragraphs 1 to 4 of the <a href=\"/doc/127072060/\" id=\"a_220\">Second Schedule of the\nRepealed Act</a>. The only change now is that an omnibus provision\nin the shape of sub-clause (e) has now been added providing that\nan application may be made to the court for such other interim\nmeasures of protection as may appear to the court to be just and\nconvenient. The interim measures of protection which would also\ninclude interim injunction should not be passed for the mere\nasking. There are well-settled and well-defined principles and\nnorms as discussed above governing the grant of temporary\ninjunctions. Suffice it to say that the power conferred under\n<a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration Act is to be exercised by the court\nonly in sparing circumstances. The interim directions can be\nissued under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 9</a> only for the purpose of arbitration\nproceedings and with a view to protect the interest of the parties\nwhich otherwise cannot be protected or safeguarded by the\narbitral tribunal. The power contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_223\">Section 9</a> is not\nintended to frustrate the arbitral proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">166. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"893926\" id=\"span_193\">In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a decision of the\nKarnataka High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/893926/\" id=\"a_224\">Deccan Asian Infrastructure\n(Mauritius) Inc. vs. BPL Communications Limited and others</a>,\nreported in (2005) 3 KarLJ 143, as contained in para 14 :</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">       &quot;14.

Under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_227\">Section 9</a> the Court has to exercise the\n       discretion in the interest of justice and take interim\n       measures to preserve the properties involved in the\n       arbitration proceedings. The interim measures are to protect\n       the properties and it must appear to the Court to be just and\n       convenient. That the words used &#x27;just and convenient&#x27; do not\n       mean that the Court can pass any Order simply because the\n       Court thinks it convenient. Such Order should be passed\n       only to protect the properties involved in the matter. It\n       cannot be disputed that as an interim measure the Court\n       can also grant an Order of temporary injunction. But can an\n       Order be issued preventing the parties to an arbitration from\n       appearing before the Arbitral Tribunal? Further even in a\n       case where an Order of injunction is to be granted the\n       parties seeking the injunction should satisfy the Court that it\n       has got a prima facie case and that if the Order is refused it\n       would result in irreparable injury to the party and further\n       the applicant should show that the balance of convenience\n       lie in favour of granting the Order rather than refusing it.\n       Even though the powers to grant an interim measure under\n       the Section is wide it has to be exercised in the spirit of the\n       underlying principles enunciated in the section.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_235\">167.

Arbitral proceedings, as\n                     we have seen, commence only when the request\n                     to refer the dispute is received by the respondent\n                     as per <a href=\"/doc/157537/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 21</a> of the Act.

This clearly contemplates\n                     two stages when the Court can pass interim\n                     orders, i.e., during the arbitral proceedings or\n                     before the arbitral proceeedings....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">               35.

The fact that a party can approach the\n               Court even during the pendency of the arbitral\n               proceedings and seek interim measure, clearly shows\n               that the legislature clearly intended to empower the\n               court to grant interim measure to last till the arbitral\n               proceedings conclude and an award is passed. As\n               noted above, the Court is empowered to grant such\n               measures even after an award is passed, but before it\n               is enforced.&quot;&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">173.
