The petitioner Union were continuously\n\n                      employed for more than six years until 15.07.2004.        When the second\n\n                      respondent terminated its earlier contract and gave the contract to another\n\n                      party, the petitioner&#x27;s members were stopped from work at that time. For all\n\n                      purposes, the members of the petitioner Union are to be treated as workers\n\n                      only.   The nature of work performed by the members of the petitioner is\n\n                      perennial in nature and the action of the second respondent in engaging them\n\n                      as contract workmen is illegal and contrary to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_12\">Contract\n\n                      Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act, 1970</a>. Therefore, the second respondent\n\n                      is not justified in having the so-called contract system for handling the\n\n                      trolleys. In Mumbai, similar workers represented to the Central Government to\n\n                      abolish the contract labour system and for their absorption. The Mumbai High\n\n                      Court directed the Central Government itself to pass appropriate orders.\n\n                      Thereafter, on 02.03.1993, a notification was issued by the Government\n\n                      prohibiting contract labour in the job of Telephone Operators but not for\n\n                      Trolley Retrievers and some other operations.     The said notification was\n\n                      challenged before the Mumbai High Court, which in turn found that the\n\n                      appropriate Government had taken irrelevant matters into consideration and\n\n                      thus, remitted the matter back to the Central Government to reconstitute the\n\n                      Central Advisory Board. The matter was taken up in appeal to the High Court\n\n                      which in turn, passed an order on 11.04.1997 reported in 1997(10) SCC 754,\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                             11</span>\n\n                      confirming the order of the High Court. Significantly, the Supreme Court also\n\n                      protected the service of the employees engaged as Trolley Retrievers and in\n\n                      certain other process.      The Central Advisory Committee did not give a\n\n                      favourable report. The Government issued an order dated 16.11.1999, stating\n\n                      that it was not necessary to prohibit contract labour including that of the\n\n                      trolley retrievers.   The petitioner was completely kept in dark about the\n\n                      abovesaid notification.     The petitioner made representations on 20.01.2003\n\n                      and 14.03.2003 to pay the members of the petitioner wages on par with the\n\n                      lowest category employee of the Airport Authority. The petitioner also filed\n\n                      W.P.No.12606 of 2003 before this Court to declare the notification dated\n\n                      16.11.1999 as illegal and unconstitutional. On 23.04.2003, an interim order of\n\n                      status quo was granted with reference to the prayer for injunction against\n\n                      termination. On 22.09.2003, the interim order was made absolute. However,\n\n                      the said writ petition was disposed of on 28.06.2012 in view of the subsequent\n\n                      writ petition filed in W.P.No.13993 of 2007, praying for mandamus directing\n\n                      the Government of India and Central Advisory Contract Labour Board to issue a\n\n                      notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 10(1)</a> of the Contract Labour (Regulation and\n\n                      Abolition) Act 1970, to prohibit the contract labour system in the job of trolley\n\n                      retrievers with the subsequent prayer to absorb the members of the petitioner\n\n                      in regular service.

It is the duty of the contractor\n\n                      to monitor and ensure smooth functioning of the retrieval of trolleys.

The Tamil Nadu Airport Workers Union\n\n                      in Chennai filed W.P.No.13993 of 2011 for a direction to issue notification\n\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 10(1)</a> of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act,\n\n                      1970, to prohibit contract labour system in the job of trolley retrieval at\n\n                      Chennai Airports and with a consequential direction to the Airports Authority\n\n                      of India and to absorb them as regular employees of AAI.

The\n\n                      said notification has not considered the fact that there is no finding from any\n\n                      Industrial Tribunal or Labour Court that the contract is sham and nominal.\n\n                      The ID filed by the employees under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 3B(11)(a)</a> of the ID Act is still\n\n                      pending.   No oral evidence was adduced by both the parties before the\n\n                      Competent Court or Tribunal. The relationship of employer and employee is a\n\n                      question to be verified and not to be assumed by the second respondent. No\n\n                      regular employee of the AAI has been involved or deputed in this work of\n\n                      retrieval of trolleys because it does not form the core function of the AAI in\n\n                      the air traffic/transport service.    The contract in this case are fair and\n\n                      genuine and does not warrant prohibition. CACLB has not taken into account\n\n                      the fact that the trolley retrieval is undertaken by genuine revenue contract\n\n                      based on advertisement rights. The Advertiser manages the contract through\n\n                      his own workmen and the trolleys are under his control.

The trolley retrieval work is neither\n\n                      assigned to regular employees nor considered as one of core functions of the\n\n                      Air traffic/air operations in international airports in Singapore or in other\n\n                      European countries.

The proper records with AAI will prove\n\n                      that the contract for trolley retrieval is genuine and valid. There is no\n\n                      camouflage in the said contracts as they are transparent and there is no direct\n\n                      supervision by AAI.

The operation of trolley retrieval is\n\n                      part and parcel of the Ground Handling Services, governed by the AAI (Central\n\n                      Management Entry for Ground Handling Services) Regulations, 2007. Thus, the\n\n                      regulation provides for the third party to be permitted on the basis of the\n\n                      revenue with AAI.

The\n\n                      Airport Authority has no co-relation due to various factors including the usage\n\n                      of modern baggages with wheels, by passengers. The claim regarding that the\n\n                      workers are skilled labourers, who mostly belong to Scheduled castes and\n\n                      Tribes and paid daily wages ranging from Rs.67 to Rs.135 is misrepresentation\n\n                      of facts, as the trolley retrieval is a purely unskilled manual work.

Whereas in this writ petition, the petitioner has specifically\n\n                      prayed for implementing the notification and for consequent absorption. The\n\n                      Supreme Court confirmed the view of the Delhi High Court that since the <a href=\"/doc/1684050/\" id=\"a_45\">AAI\n\n                      Act</a> mandates the AAI to provide passenger services, they have to employ\n\n                      trolley retrievers and give preference to the erstwhile contract workers in such\n\n                      employment. The Contract Labour Act is a special law and <a href=\"/doc/1684050/\" id=\"a_46\">AAI Act</a> is a general\n\n                      law insofar as it deal with the ground handling rules.

The issue regarding special law and general law has been\n\n                      considered by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/791872/\" id=\"a_47\">Life Insurance Corporation of\n\n                      India vs. D.J.Bagadur</a> reported in 1981(1) SCC 315.
