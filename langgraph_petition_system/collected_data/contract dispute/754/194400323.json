Therefore, this falls squarely within the\n                                              purview of Clause 26 of SCC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                              41.

The Claimant actually pays to its labour\n                                              only the minimum wages and not the notional claim and\n                                              therefore any award for payment of such notional claim\n                                              would amount to unjust enrichment.

We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that\n                                              increased compensation claimed cannot be based on the\n                                              formula or Lump sum basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                              42.

It is submitted that para (i) of Appendix 2 stipulates that\n                             the components of the contract price are subject to price adjustment during\n                             performance of the contract to reflect changes in the cost of labour and\n                             material components in accordance with other provision mentioned in\n                             Appendix 2. He submits that Appendix 2 is a complete clause in itself with\n                             respect to any change or modification in the contract price, and therefore, on\n                             a bare reading of the same when it is clear that it covers any change in cost\n                             of labour, the Arbitral Tribunal was not allowed to read into it with regard to\n                             the basic wages. He states that Appendix 2 being a special clause, will\n                             supersede all general clauses. The Appendix 2 in its form is exhaustive and\n                             therefore eliminates the possibility of any further price adjustment towards\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">Digitally Signed By:HARIOM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">SINGH KIRMOLIYA              FAO(OS) (COMM) 45/2022 etc.                                       Page 17 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">Signing Date:19.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">21:32:06</span>\n                              labour component that is not covered in Appendix 2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">                             10.   Mr. Lekhi submits that the Ld. Single Judge has erred by not\n                             appreciating the fact that Appendix 2 creates a specific provision expressly\n                             dealing with the subject of minimum wages and limits entitlement and thus,\n                             the parties cannot be subjected to a regime of rights and duties beyond the\n                             terms which have been specifically agreed upon. It is submitted that the Ld.\n                             Single Judge has erroneously upheld the observations of the Ld. Tribunal\n                             and has overlooked the fact that the entitlement is only interms of Appendix\n                             2 of the contract. It is submitted thatchange of law to the extent that it deals\n                             with minimum wages and the same being specifically and expressly\n                             provided in Appendix 2, would be excluded from Clause 26 of the SCC.\n                             Consequently, reliance by the Arbitrator on Clause 26 of SCC is an instance\n                             of patent illegality of award which the Ld. Single Judge has overlooked.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">                             11.

Mr. Lekhi also submits that the Ld.

It is\n                             submitted that the Ld.

It is submitted by Mr. Lekhi that the Ld.

The Ld. Single Judge\n                             has erred in upholding the awards given by the Ld. Tribunals based on the\n                             documents of the Appellant. The Ld. Single Judge while stating that the\n                             <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_14\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> will not apply stricto senso has failed to\n                             appreciate that while the laws of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_15\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> may not\n                             apply strictly to arbitration proceedings, the underlying principles are very\n                             much applicable. It is submitted that the same propounds that a party\n                             claiming something is required to prove its claims through substantial proof.\n                             The Respondent has admittedly failed to even provide any documents to\n                             substantiate the award of monies passed in its favour and the Ld.

Mr. Lekhi has further submitted that the Ld. Single Judge, vide its\n                             Impugned Judgements ignores the fact that claims cannot be conceded in the\n                             absence of any evidence whatsoever and unless there is relevant and\n                             admissible evidence bearing out of the claim, there is no entitlement in law\n                             for the claim made. It has been submitted that the Ld.

It is submitted that disregard of contractual obligations\n                             would amount to patent illegality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">                             15.   Mr. Lekhi, with regards to his point on evidence, has also submitted\n                             that the Ld.

The Respondent had from the\n                             very inception of the dispute, consciously and intentionally taken a stand\n                             that its claims are allowed notionally and that it does not have to prove the\n                             same. While the Respondent was allowed the opportunity to file his SOC,\n                             Rejoinder, Written Submission etc. and lead evidence, the Respondent\n                             intentionally chose to not bring on record any documents to substantiate its\n                             notional claims. Therefore, the Ld. Single Judge has erred in upholding the\n                             portion of the Ld. Tribunal&#x27;s award whereby the Ld. Tribunal has awarded\n                             costs to the Respondent, such costs being unproved by the Respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">                             16.   Mr. Lekhi has submitted that with respect to the finding by the Ld.\n                             Single Judge and the Ld. Tribunal on the Appellant making an admission\n                             with regards to its liability to pay monies to the Respondent, is erroneous.\n                             He submits that there was in fact never any admission made by the\n                             Appellant. It was submitted that there was no admission in a manner\n                             understood in law of any amount claimed by the Respondent for the\n                             Tribunal to justify award of that amount by the Tribunal and the Court was\n                             not called upon to re-appreciate or re-evaluate the material but only to see\n                             whether the material available justified the claim. There was, therefore,\n                             adequate cause for interference with the awards of the Tribunals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77286517\" id=\"span_96\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1478013\" id=\"span_97\">17.

It is submitted by Mr. Lekhi that in assessing the quantum payable by\n                             the Appellant to the Respondent, the Ld. Tribunal treated as admission, that,\n                             which does not qualify as one. Neither the Affidavit nor the Written\n                             Submissions to which the reference is made by the Ld. Tribunal, according\n                             to him, can be construed as the Appellant conceding to any entitlement of\n                             the Respondent as to exempt the latter from the obligation to prove its\n                             entitlement, as observed in the Award and by the Ld.

It is submitted that\n                             admissions, in order to be acted upon have to be clear and unequivocal. It\n                             cannot conceivably be held that the Appellant ever admitted the truth of the\n                             claim made by the Respondent or that the submission made by it rendered a\n                             judicial determination of Respondent&#x27;s right. The Ld. Single Judge has also\n                             erred in appreciating the fact that the objections filed by the Respondent to\n                             the award of the Ld.

It is submitted by Mr. Lekhi that the entire finding of the Ld.

It has to be seen that the Respondent was\n                             specifically required to substantiate and prove its own claims. Nowhere had\n                             the Appellant submitted or conceded to the fact that the documents so\n                             submitted would constitute an admission of amounts due and payable to the\n                             Respondent from the Appellant. The entire finding of the Ld. Tribunal is\n                             based in the absence of any evidence by the Respondent who had burden to\n                             prove its case. The Ld.

Tribunal by awarding such amount without the\n                             Respondent having proved so, as its stand was that it does not have to prove\n                             any amounts. Further, when there is a specific averment by the Respondent\n                             that it does not have to prove any amounts claimed even after getting\n                             sufficient opportunity by way of SOC, Rejoinder, Evidence, Written\n                             Submission etc. the Tribunal ought not to have overstepped its jurisdiction\n                             by reading into the documents of the Appellant to prove the claims for the\n                             Respondent when the Respondent itself was not interested to do so. The Ld.\n                             Single Judge ought to have allowed the objections of the Appellant on this\n                             ground alone. It is submitted that the findings of the Ld. Tribunal as well as\n                             the Ld. Single Judge are perverse on this count, as the entire principle of\n                             burden of proof has been diluted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                             21.   Mr. Lekhi further submitted that in so far as making observations\n                             regarding the portion of the awards pertaining to further opportunity being\n                             granted to the Respondent to prove its claims, the Ld. Single Judge made\n                             contradictory findings and disregarded the principle of law that a party is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">Digitally Signed By:HARIOM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">SINGH KIRMOLIYA              FAO(OS) (COMM) 45/2022 etc.                                      Page 22 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">Signing Date:19.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">21:32:06</span>\n                              precluded from raising any claim or issue which it could and should have in\n                             the first instance. Moreover, the principle of finality was violated as an\n                             award has to be a complete decision on the issues raised without leaving\n                             aspects to be dealt with subsequently by a third party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">                             22.   Insofar as the observations of the Ld. Single Judge on the portion of\n                             the awards of the Ld. Tribunal regarding further opportunity granted to the\n                             Respondent to establish its claims is concerned, Mr. Lekhi submitted that the\n                             Ld. Single Judge has made contradictory findings. He submitted that the Ld.\n                             Single Judge noticed that the operative part of the award wherein the Ld.\n                             Tribunal concluded that the Respondent failed to establish the amount it had\n                             claimed on account of increased expenditure. He submits that the Ld. Single\n                             Judge also concluded that the Respondent had failed in its contention that\n                             the claims were required to be calculated on a notional basis. However, the\n                             Ld. Single Judge further went on to observe with respect to the submissions\n                             that the Tribunal could not issue further directions having found that L&amp;T\n                             had failed to prove its claim to correctly conclude that the submission had\n                             merit and the direction of further opportunity was beyond the scope of\n                             reference of Arbitral Tribunal. It also found that the mechanism devised by\n                             the Tribunal for reference to the dispute to the Chartered Accountant as to\n                             quantify the claim to be patently erroneous. It is submitted that the Ld.\n                             Single Judge disregarded the principle of law that a party is precluded from\n                             raising any claim or issue which it could and should have brought in an\n                             earlier proceeding and for want of reasonable diligence to bring forward the\n                             points as would support the claim made would bar the subsequent raising of\n                             the points which it failed to argue in full earlier. Moreover, the principle of\n                             finality of award was violated as an award has to be a complete decision on\n                             the issues raised without leaving aspects of those issues to be subsequently\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Digitally Signed By:HARIOM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">SINGH KIRMOLIYA              FAO(OS) (COMM) 45/2022 etc.                                       Page 23 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Signing Date:19.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">21:32:06</span>\n                              dealt with by a third party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">                             23.   Mr. Lekhi, while concluding, clearly stated that that the Respondent\n                             did not succeed on its case as was pleaded and that the entitlement being\n                             upheld by the Ld.

At first, before giving our findings and\n                             decision, we find it pertinent to highlight the degree to which the Courts of\n                             Law can interfere with arbitral proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 34</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1525862/\" id=\"a_32\">37</a> of the\n                             A&amp;C Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">                             31.   It is no longer res integra that the scope of interference by the Courts\n                             in arbitration proceedings and arbitral awards is narrow. The Courts should\n                             be slow and circumspect in interfering with any award which is passed by an\n                             arbitral tribunal which has been appointed pursuant to an agreement between\n                             the parties to the dispute. <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 34</a> of the A&amp;C Act outlines within it, only\n                             certain instances under which the Courts can interfere with any award\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">Digitally Signed By:HARIOM</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">SINGH KIRMOLIYA              FAO(OS) (COMM) 45/2022 etc.                                      Page 26 of 49</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Signing Date:19.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">21:32:06</span>\n                              passed by arbitral tribunals and set it aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">                             32.

It is apparent from the above that NTPC&#x27;s witness\n                                         had affirmed that he had collated the records and data\n                                         submitted by L&amp;T and had produced the results of the\n                                         same. The said affidavit clearly established that L&amp;T\n                                         had submitted documents and returns to NTPC\n                                         indicating the number of man days in relation to which\n                                         the increase in minimum wages was required to be\n                                         considered. Undeniably, the tabular statements\n                                         produced by NTPC did constitute material, which\n                                         could be considered by the Arbitral Tribunal. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_75\">The\n                                         Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> does not apply strictosensu\n                                         to arbitral proceedings.

Thus, this Court is also\n                                         unable to accept that the impugned award is liable to\n                                         be interfered with.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"48366848\" id=\"span_200\">35.

In order to succeed, the appellant must\n                                         establish that the finding of the Arbitrator is based on\n                                         no evidence or the Arbitrator has taken into account\n                                         material which is irrelevant or has ignored vital\n                                         evidence. The argument which has been raised before\n                                         us is that the arbitral Tribunal was required to call for\n                                         the completion plan, which was in the control and\n                                         custody and possession of respondent No. 1.

Clearly, in this view, the award of interest\n                                         from the date of Statement of Claims is patently\n                                         erroneous and unsustainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">                                         29.

The expert witness examined by L&amp;T had\n                                         deposed that in contracts of similar nature, increase in\n                                         wages is compensated by notional formulas and not on\n                                         the basis of actual\n                                         reimbursement as a contractor could execute the works\n                                         by various methods. The contractor has the option to\n                                         deploy a higher work force and use mechanical means\n                                         to a lesser decree. Alternatively, he may deploy higher\n                                         number of machines and use a lean labour force. Thus,\n                                         the compensation is required to be made for increase\n                                         in costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">                                         30.

The Arbitral Tribunal had\n                                         examined the language of Clause 26 of the SCC and\n                                         found that the said clause had implied the use of the\n                                         word ‗reimbursement&#x27;. The Arbitral Tribunal reasoned\n                                         that for the petitioner to establish the claim on the\n                                         basis of reimbursement, it was required to establish\n                                         that it had incurred additional expenditure and the\n                                         same was on account of increase in labour wages as\n                                         notified under the Notification.

Contravention of a statute not linked to\n                                              public policy or public interest cannot be a\n                                              ground to set at naught an arbitral award as\n                                              being discordant with the fundamental policy of\n                                              Indian law and neither can it be brought within\n                                              the confines of ‗patent illegality&#x27; as discussed\n                                              above.

In view of the law <a href=\"/doc/105410953/\" id=\"a_131\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court that scope of judicial\n                             scrutiny and interference by an appellate court under <a href=\"/doc/1525862/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 37</a> of the Act is\n                             even more restrictive then <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 34</a> of the Act and that in entertaining\n                             appeals under <a href=\"/doc/1525862/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 37</a> of the Act, the Court is not actually sitting as a\n                             Court of appeal, this Court does not find that the Order of the Tribunal, as\n                             confirmed by the learned Single Judge, is so perverse or suffers from patent\n                             illegality which requires interference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">                             39.   The Ld. Single Judge has rightly also stated that the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_135\">Indian Evidence\n                             Act, 1872</a> would not apply stricto senso to arbitral proceedings and that it is\n                             only the principles of evidence which shall be applicable to the proceedings.\n                             It is not as if no prudent person could arrive at the conclusion which the Ld.\n                             Tribunals have arrived at. The Ld. Single Judge has rightly held that the\n                             decision of the Ld. Tribunals to draw an inference from the material placed\n                             before it, cannot be faulted. It is not as if the Ld. Tribunals have taken a\n                             view which is not even possible, or interpreted the contract in a manner\n                             which no fair minded or reasonable person could have or based their\n                             decision off of no evidence at all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">                             40.
