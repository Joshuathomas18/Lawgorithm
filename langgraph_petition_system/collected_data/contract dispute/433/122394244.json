Respondent No. 2 further\n       contended that, though the petitionertreated her as a permanent\n       employee while extracting work from her, she was not paid all\n       the emoluments and perks given to permanent employees.

However, the ―Der Spiegel‖ magazine was\n         not a ―newspaper‖, within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the\n         Working Journalists Act. As such, there could be no ―industrial\n         dispute‖, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, within\n         the meaning of the expression as defined in clause (k) of\n         <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2</a> of the ID Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">5.

This, she\ncontended in her affidavit-in-evidence, entitled her to be regularised,\nin terms of the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_5\">ID Act</a>.

Respondent No. 2 further deposed that, in September 2012, ―a\nnew correspondent, a fully paid German National on a permanent\ncontract, was posted in New Delhi in the same position‖ as had been\nheld by her. Respondent No. 2 further deposed thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       ―15.

I state that though the Agreement dated 1st May,\n       1998 is styled as a ‗freelance employee&#x27; contract, was in\n       essence a permanent Employee Contract clearly\n       stipulating my duties and responsibilities vis-à-vis\n       writing and reporting.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       18. I state that though I was assured on numerous\n       occasions that I would be conferred the status of\n       permanent employee in due course as the nature of my\n       duties and responsibilities were that of permanent\n       employee. However, on one pretext or another, the\n       respondents kept delaying the process of making me\n       permanent employee and deceitfully and designedly kept\n       me on annual contract for 14 (fourteen) long years. Thus,\n       depriving me of my legitimate dues for all these years.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       19. I state that the permanent nature of the contract can\n       be safely deduced and inferred from the fact that the\n       entire intellectual property rights (IPR) i.e. copyright\n       over the written original work has been retained, without\n       my authorisation by M/s Spiegel-Verlag (Spiegel\n       Publishers).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                            Page 8 of 61</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">        20.

The Labour Court was,\n       therefore, proscribed from hearing and adjudicating the same\n       issue all over again.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">       (xv) The Labour Court had erred in failing to appreciate that\n       the proceedings before it were also hit by the principle of issue\n       estoppel, inasmuch as the Hamburg Labour Court had\n       categorically   held    that   the   relationship   between     the\n       petitionerand Respondent No. 2 had come to an end on 30th\n       April, 2012. It was not open to Respondent No. 2, therefore, to\n       reagitate this issue before the Labour Court India. The Labour\n       Court in India had no jurisdiction to upset the finding of the\n       Hamburg Labour Court. Mr. Dhruv Dewan emphasised, in this\n       context, the fact that the prayer of Respondent No. 2, before the\n       Hamburg Labour Court, was for determination of her legal\n       status.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">       (xvi) The Labour Court had erred in failing to appreciate that\n       the proceedings before it were not maintainable as Respondent\n       No. 2 was not a ―working journalist‖ within the meaning of\n       section 2(f) of the Working Journalists Act. In order to establish\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 21 of 61</span>\n        such relationship, the factum of employment needed to be\n       proved. As Respondent No. 2 was never an employee of the\n       petitioner, she could not be treated as a ―working journalist‖.\n       This issue had not been considered by the Labour Court. For\n       this proposition, Mr. Dewan sought to place reliance on the\n       judgment of the Supreme Court in Management of Express\n       Newspapers ltd. v. B. Somayajulu, AIR 1964 SC 279. He also\n       invited my attention to <a href=\"/doc/452505/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 3</a> of the said Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">       (xvii) The Labour Court had also erred in failing to note that\n       the petitionerwas not a ―newspaper establishment‖ and that\n       ―Der Spiegel‖ was not a ―newspaper‖ within the meaning of the\n       Working Journalists Act. Neither was it registered, in India,\n       under <a href=\"/doc/141313242/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 5</a> of the Press and Registration of Books Act,\n       1867.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">       (xviii) Even if ―Der Spiegel‖ was eligible to be regarded as a\n       ―newspaper‖,     under the     Working    Journalists   Act, the\n       petitionercould not be regarded as a ―newspaper establishment‖\n       under clause (d) of <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 2</a> of the said statute. Mr. Dewan\n       invited my attention, in this context, to the stand of Respondent\n       No. 2, as reflected in her rejoinder, dated 3rd July, 2012, to the\n       response, of the petitioner, to her suit before the Labour Court\n       in Hamburg, in which it was averred thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">               ―The court points so insofar to the fact, that the\n               Defendant is headquartered in Hamburg but had a\n               branch in New Delhi.

Therefore it is only the Plaintiff,\n               who represents the company in India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">               This is also confirmed by the fact that the\n               letterhead, which was printed at the HQ in\n               Hamburg for the Plaintiff, among other things\n               bears the text: ―Editorial Office 101 Golf Links,\n               New Delhi‖ as well as Headquarters and\n               Registration Court Hamburg HRA 617555 and\n               Headquarters and Registration Code Hamburg\n               HRB 13105.‖\n\n               All matters pertaining to the contract signed with\n               the Plaintiff are also decided by the Headquarters\n               of the SPIEGEL in Hamburg.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">               This proves, that firstly, the Defendant had no\n               official office/branch in New Delhi and secondly,\n               that it describes the Plaintiff as its official\n               representative in India. This circumstance\n               therewith speaks for the applicability of German\n               law.‖\n\n       (xix) Mr. Dewan also referred to the affidavit-in-evidence of\n       WW-1 Sudhir Mohan Verma, in which the said witnesses\n       deposed that to his ―knowledge and belief the Respondent- M/s\n       Spiegel-Verlag (Der Spiegel) does not have a place of business\n       in India, does not have a PAN or TAN and therefore was not\n       deducting any Income Tax at Source.‖ The petitioneredited,\n       printed and published on articles in Germany, and had no\n       presence, physical or otherwise, in India.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                               Page 23 of 61</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">        (xx) The Working Journalists Act did not have any\n       extraterritorial effect.

As the contract\n       between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 stood terminated\n       by efflux of time, the Labour Court erred in directing\n       reinstatement of Respondent No. 2, which would amount to\n       continuation of an expired contract, which was impermissible in\n       law. Mr. Dewan also expressed uncertainty as to how the\n       direction, of the Labour Court, in the impugned Award, for\n       reinstatement of Respondent No. 2 along with consequential\n       benefits, could work, especially pointing out that no period, to\n       which Respondent No. 2 was required to be reinstated, was\n       specified.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">       (xxii) It was never the petitioner&#x27;s case, before the Labour\n       Court, that it had closed its operations in India owing to\n       financial constraints.

Arguing per contra, Mr. Parag Tripathi, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing for Respondent No. 2 initially drew my attention to the\nlimited scope of interference, by Courts, exercising jurisdiction under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, with awards of Labour\nCourts, submitting that interference was warranted only in cases\nwhere the award was found to be perverse. Reliance was placed, for\nthis purpose, on the judgments in <a href=\"/doc/84236580/\" id=\"a_18\">General Manager, Oil and Natural\nGas Commission Silchar v. Oil and Natural Gas Commission</a>\ncontractual workers Union,(2008) 12 SCC 275 and Trambak Rubber\nIndustries v.Nashik Workers Union and Ors., (2003) 6 SCC 416.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"84236580\" id=\"span_29\">20.     Mr. Tripathi also sought to discountenance the reliance, by\nMr.Dewan, on the proceedings before the Hamburg Labour Court, and\nthe order, dated 30th October, 2012, passed by the said Court as a\nconsequence thereof. At worst, submitted Mr. Tripathi<a href=\"/doc/84236580/\" id=\"a_19\">, <a href=\"/doc/84236580/\" id=\"a_20\">the said\ndecision</a></a> could amount to a pronouncement that, under German law,\nthere    was        no   employer-employee   relationship   between    the\npetitionerand Respondent No. 2 and, even if there was, Respondent\nNo. 2 was not entitled to any relief. Mr. Tripathi also sought to point\nout that the decision of the Hamburg Labour Court was not\nenforceable at law in India. Mr. Tripathi also pointed out, in this\ncontext, that, before the Hamburg Labour Court, the petitionerhad\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 25 of 61</span>\n itself sought to submit that Indian Law was applicable to the case, and\nhad specifically contended that ―the claims made by (the complainant)\nagainst the applicability of Indian Law are not comprehensible‖. He\nalso pointed out that, in the same submissions, the petitioneradmitted\nthat ―the defendant maintained an office in New Delhi, India, in which\nthe complainant worked‖, and that, though the house was used both as\na residence and office of Respondent No. 2, that was at her own\ndesire. The petitionerhad also admitted, in the said pleadings, that\n―several other employees worked in this office who were paid by‖ it,\n―particularly an office Assistant, first Raghu Varma till 2007 and since\nMay 2008 Ms. Ekta Kapoor‖.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">21.    The use of the word ―freelance‖, in the agreement/contract\ndated 9th April, 1998 supra, between the petitionerand Respondent\nNo. 2, Mr. Tripathi would seek to submit, could not determine the\njuralrelationship between them. It was the substance of the\nrelationship that mattered, he would submit, rather than the form\nthereof. Pointing out that Respondent No. 2 had worked, for the\npetitioner, for as many as 5110 days, Mr. Tripathi sought to rely on\nthe paras, from the affidavit-in-evidence of Respondent No. 2,\ntestifying as WW-1 before the Labour Court, which already stands\nextracted in para 9 hereinabove.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">22.    In this context, Mr. Tripathi also emphasised the fact that\nRespondent No. 2 had been issued identity cards and media\naccreditation cards, showing her as a journalist working with Der\nSpiegel. The fact of issuance of these cards, though pleaded by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                             Page 26 of 61</span>\n Respondent No. 2 had not, it was pointed out, being repelled by the\npetitioner. In fact, submitted Mr. Tripathi, no evidence, whatsoever,\nhad been led, by the petitioner, to substantiate its allegation that the\nrelationship between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 was purely\ncontractual, and that it exercised no control over her.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">23.    Mr. Tripathi also relied on a communication, dated 18th\nNovember, 2010, from the petitionerto the Principal Information\nOfficer, PIB, as well as a certificate, dated 25th October, 2011, issued\nby the petitioner, both of which were part of the record before the\nlearned Labour Court. The communication dated 18th November, 2010\nstated that Respondent No. 2, ―holder of Government of India press\naccreditation card number 478, will continue to be our South Asia\ncorrespondent and chief of bureau in the year 2011‖ and, for that\nreason, sought renewal of her accreditation. Similarly, the certificate\ndated 25th October, 2011 certified that Respondent No. 2 ―is working\nfull-time as a reporter/researcher covering political and social events\nin India for the foreign Department of Der Spiegel, the German news\nweekly‖, and went on to state that ―the magazine will take full\nresponsibility for work and will, of course, carried the expenses which\nmay occur‖. Again, for these reasons, renewal of her accreditation was\nsought.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">24.    In such circumstances, if the learned Labour Court held that\nthere existed, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, the\nrelationship of employer and employee, the finding could not be said\nto be tainted, in any manner, by perversity, as would justify\ninterference, therewith, by this Court. Mr. Tripathi took me, in this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                             Page 27 of 61</span>\n context, through various documents, produced by Respondent No. 2\nas evidence in her support before the learned Labour Court, and\nsought to submit that these documents more than discharged the\nburden of proof, cast on her, to establish the relationship, between the\npetitionerand her, of employer and employee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_61\">25.    The income tax returns of Respondent No. 2, Mr. Tripathi\nwould seek to submit, were totally irrelevant in determining the issue\nin controversy. Declarations contained in the said returns, Mr. Tripathi\nwould submit, could only decide the entitlement, or otherwise, of\nRespondent No. 2, to deductions sought by her, and could not be used\nas substantive evidence to determine the nature of the relationship\nbetween her and the petitioner. The judgment inM/sNew Era Impex\n(India) Pvt.Ltd. v. M/s Oriole Exports Pvt. Ltd., 2016 SCC Online\n4352, he would submit, was distinguishable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">26.    Expanding on the issue of the proceedings before the Hamburg\nLabour Court, Mr. Tripathi drew especial attention to the averments,\nin the pleadings of the petitionerbefore the said learned Court, already\nextracted hereinabove, in which the petitionerdiscountenanced the\nchallenge, of Respondent No. 2, to the applicability, to the case, of\nIndian Law. He pointed out that it was further admitted, in the\npleadings, that the office at New Delhi, where Respondent No. 2\nworked, was maintained by the petitioner, and that it was being used\nas a residence at her own choice. The same pleadings also admitted\nthe fact that several other employees, working in the said office, were\nalso paid by the petitioner. In view thereof, Mr. Tripathi would seek to\ncontend that it did not lie in the mouth of the petitionerto argue, before\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 28 of 61</span>\n this Court, or before the learned Labour Court below, that Respondent\nNo. 2 was not its permanent employee. In any event, Mr. Tripathi\nwould point out that, under <a href=\"/doc/109609421/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 13(f)</a> of the CPC, the order of the\nHamburg Labour Court was unenforceable in India. Besides, the\nrights of Respondent No. 2, in Indian Law, could not be answered by\nthe Labour Court at Hamburg.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">27.    The submission, of the petitioner, to the effect that it had not\npleaded financial constraints as the basis for not renewing the\nemployment of Respondent No. 2 was, Mr. Tripathi would seek to\npoint out, erroneous, for which purpose my attention was invited to\nvarious pages of the evidence before the learned Labour Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_64\">28.

No doubt, the claim of Respondent No. 2, before the Labour\nCourt at Hamburg was similar to that raised before the Labour Court\nin the present case.

According to that rule of Law,\n       an action seeking a declaratory judgment finding on the\n       existence or non-existence of a legal relationship may be\n       brought where the claimant party has a legal interest in a\n       judicial decision finding on the legal relationship.

Read in the backdrop of Section 256 (1) of the German <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_39\">CPC</a>, it\nis clear that the Labour Court and Hamburg did not adjudicate on the\nissue, regarding which Respondent No. 2 had sought a declaratory\njudgment from it, i.e., regarding the existence of a relationship of\nemployer and employee, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2,\nwith no fixed term. Section 256(1) of the German <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_40\">CPC</a> permits a\nlitigant to seek such a declaration of existence of a jural relationship,\nwhere ―the plaintiff has a legitimate interest in having the legal\nrelationship... established by a judicial ruling at the court&#x27;s earliest\nconvenience‖. The Labour Court at Hamburg has, in its Order dated\n30th October, 2012 supra, opined that, as the relationship between the\npetitionerand Respondent No. 2 had ended, and, applying German\nlaw, even if a relationship of employer and employee had existed,\nbetween them, prior to 30th April, 2012, the said relationship would\nstill have ended as on 30th April, 2012, and as there was no claim, by\nRespondent No. 2, for a declaration that the said relationship had not\nended on 30th April, 2012, there ―did not survive any continuing\ninterest, in Respondent No. 2, for a declaration regarding the existence\nof the said relationship, which could be said to have implications for\nthe presence or the future.‖ This Court is not required to go into the\ncorrectness, or otherwise, of the said interpretation, or view, expressed\nby the Labour Court at Hamburg. Suffice it to state that, clearly, the\nLabour Court at Hamburg not think it appropriate to enter into the\nissue referred to it by Respondent No. 2,, regarding the issue of\nwhether there had existed, between the petitionerand Respondent No.\n2, a relationship of employer and employee.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 36 of 61</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\"> 39.    The said issue may not have had any implications on the rights\nof Respondent No. 2, vis-à-vis the petitioner, in German law. They do,\nhowever, in the law that applies in this country. In case a workman is\nretrenched by an employer, in contravention of <a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 25-F</a> of the ID\nAct, labour Courts in India have to strike down the retrenchment as\nillegal, and all consequential benefits would, thereupon, enure in\nfavour of the retrenched workman. It is a defence, to the management,\nin all such cases, to plead that there was no employer-employee\nrelationship, between the management and the litigating workman.\nSuch a defence has, predictably, been taken, in the present case, as\nwell, by the petitioner, vis-à-vis Respondent No. 2. The determination\nof the nature of the relationship, between the petitionerand\nRespondent No. 2 in the present case is, therefore, necessary, before\nthe Labour Court could arrive at a decision, regarding the merits of the\nclaim of Respondent No. 2.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">40.    The Labour Court at Hamburg not having returned any finding\non this issue, this Court would, therefore, in examining the said\naspect, not be revisiting the decision of the Labour Court at Hamburg\nin any manner, or to any extent.

For the same reason, the pleas of res judicata and issue\nestoppel, as raised by the petitioner, have also to fail.

In order therefore that the decision\n               in the earlier two appeals dismissed by the High\n               Court operates as res judicata it will have to be\n               seen whether all the five conditions mentioned\n               above have been satisfied.‖\n                                                 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                                  Page 38 of 61</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"785132\" id=\"span_54\">42.    Though there is a subtle distinction between the principles of\nres judicata and issue estoppel, that distinction is based on the\ndifference in the entity against which the issue would operate. In either\ncase, the sine qua non, for the principle to apply, is that the issue must\nhave been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. If\nthat condition is satisfied, any other court is precluded, by operation of\nthe principle of res judicata, from revisiting the issue, whereas either\nlitigant, in the former litigation, is proscribed, by the principal of issue\nestoppel, from reagitating it. As such, res judicata operates as a fetter\non the court, whereas issue estoppel operates as a fetter on the litigant.\nThis distinction was tellingly, even if briefly, emphasised, by the\nSupreme Court, in <a href=\"/doc/785132/\" id=\"a_45\">Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar</a>, (2005) 1\nSCC 787, in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">       29. There is a distinction between ―issue estoppel‖ and ―res\n       judicata‖.

Res judicata debars a court from exercising its\n       jurisdiction to determine the lis if it has attained finality\n       between the parties whereas the doctrine issue estoppel is\n       invoked against the party. If such an issue is decided against\n       him, he would be estopped from raising the same in the latter\n       proceeding.

Inasmuch as the Labour Court at Hamburg did not decide any\nissue, and expressed no opinion on the jural relationship, existing\nbetween the petitionerand Respondent No. 2, the order, dated 30 th\nOctober, 2012, of the Labour Court at Hamburg, cannot impact, in any\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                                Page 39 of 61</span>\n manner, the present litigation.

That Respondent No. 2 was a journalist, is not, and cannot be,\ndenied. Nor can it be denied that she was employed by the petitioner,\nas the letter, dated 9th April, 1998 supra, itself refers to her as a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                               Page 41 of 61</span>\n ―freelance employee‖ of the petitioner. Having thus designated her in\nits letter dated 9th April, 1998, it cannot lie in the mouth of the\npetitionerto contend, before this Court, that the respondent was not its\nemployee. Significantly, it is not necessary, for a person to qualify to\nbe regarded as a ―working journalist‖, under the Working Journalists\nAct, to be employed in the newspaper establishment. It is sufficient if\nshe, or he, is employed in relation to the said establishment. All\npersons, therefore, whose principal avocation is journalism, and who,\nthough not employed in a newspaper establishment, are employed in\nrelation to a newspaper establishment, would satisfy the definition of\n―working journalist‖, for the purpose of application of the Working\nJournalists Act.Every journalist, who is employed, in her/his capacity\nof journalist, by, or in relation to, a newspaper establishment, is, per\ndefinition, ―working journalist‖, within the meaning of the Working\nJournalists Act, the only exceptions being in respect of persons falling\nunder the categories contemplated by clauses (i) and (ii) in clause (f)\nof Section 2 of the Working Journalists Act supra. The petitionerdoes\nnot seek to contend that Respondent No. 2 was employed in a\nmanagerial or a supervisory capacity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_99\">48.    The main contention, of Mr. Dewan, apropos the applicability,\nto the facts of the present case, of the Working Journalists Act, is not\nthat Respondent No. 2 is not a ―working journalist‖, as ordinarily\nunderstood, but that the petitioneris not a ―newspaper establishment‖,\nwithin the meaning of the expression is used in the said Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                               Page 42 of 61</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\"> 49.    ―Newspaper establishment‖ is defined in clause (d) of Section 2\nof the Working Journalists Act as meaning ―an establishment under\nthe control of any person or body of persons, whether incorporated or\nnot, for the production or publication of one or more newspapers or\nfor conducting any news agency or syndicate and includes newspaper\nestablishments specified as one establishment under the Schedule‖.\nThe explanation to the said clause clarifies that, for the purposes\nthereof, ―(a) different departments, branches and centres of newspaper\nestablishments shall be treated as parts thereof‖ and ―(b) a printing\npress shall be deemed to be a newspaper establishment if the principal\nbusiness thereof is to print newspaper‖. ―Newspaper‖, in turn, is\ndefined, in clause (b) of Section 2 of the Working Journalists Act as\nmeaning ―any printed periodical work containing public news or\ncomments on public news‖, and as including ―such other class of\nprinted periodical work as may, from time to time, be notified in this\nbehalf by the Central Government in the Official Gazette‖.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\">50.    ―Der Spiegel‖ is, admittedly, a printed periodical work,\ncontaining public news.

The word ―establishment‖ does not find definition, either in the\nWorking Journalists Act, or in the ID act.

We may safely conclude that the literal rule of\n       construction may be the primary approach to be utilised\n       for interpretation of a statute and that words in the statute\n       should in the first instance be given their meaning as\n       understood in common parlance. However, the ESI Act is\n       a beneficial legislation. It seeks to provide social security\n       to those workers as it encompasses. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"157865283\" id=\"span_61\">In the light of the\n       cases <a href=\"/doc/157865283/\" id=\"a_51\">referred above</a>, it may be seen that the traditional\n       approach can be substituted.

However, for this purpose as\n       well, the scheme, context and objects of the legislature\n       must be taken into consideration. Taking into due\n       consideration the nature and purpose of the <a href=\"/doc/88376/\" id=\"a_52\">ESI Act</a>, the\n       dictionary meaning as understood in the context of the\n       said Act would be preferable to achieve the objects of the\n       legislature.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">       34. In the absence of any definition as provided in the\n       <a href=\"/doc/88376/\" id=\"a_53\">ESI Act</a>, this Court may look into its dictionary meaning\n       for guidance or as an aid of construction of the term\n       ―establishment‖. Dictionaries do define the meaning of a\n       word as understood in common parlance:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">       34.1. According to Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, 7th Edn.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">       (1999), the term ―establishment‖ means, inter alia:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">               ―establishment.-- n. ...

According to Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol. LXXX,\n       the term ―establishment‖ has been explained as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">               ―Establishment.-- ... More specifically, a fixed\n               place where business is conducted, or a place\n               where the public is invited to come and have its\n               work done; an institution or place of business with\n               its fixtures and organised staff; any office or place\n               of business, with its fixtures, the place in which\n               one is permanently fixed for residence or business;\n               a permanent commercial organisation, as a\n               manufacturing establishment; the place of business\n               or residence with grounds, fixtures, equipage, etc.,\n               with which one is fitted out; also that which serves\n               for the carrying on of a business....‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">       35. Therefore, it can be simply stated that an\n       ―establishment‖ is a term which can have a wide\n       meaning. It would be any place where business is\n       conducted, or in other words, it would be any place of\n       business. Now the question arises whether a ―race club‖\n       is in the nature of a place where business is conducted.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">       To answer the same, the activities that are undertaken by\n       the appellant Turf Club require to be noticed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">       37. The term ―establishment‖ would mean the place\n       for transacting any business, trade or profession or work\n       connected with or incidental or ancillary thereto. It is true\n       that the definition in dictionaries is the conventional\n       definition attributed to trade or commerce, but it cannot\n       be wholly valid for the purpose of constructing social\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                               Page 45 of 61</span>\n        welfare legislation in a modern welfare State. The test of\n       finding out whether professional activity falls within the\n       meaning of the expression ―establishment‖ is whether the\n       activity is systematically and habitually undertaken for\n       production or distribution of the goods or services to the\n       community with the help of employees in the manner of\n       a trade or business in such an undertaking. If a systematic\n       economic or commercial activity is carried on in the\n       premises, it would follow that the establishment at which\n       such an activity is carried on is a ―shop‖. This Court, in\n       ESICorpn. v. Hyderabad Race Club, (2004) 6 SCC 191\n       : 2004 SCC (L&amp;S) 855, keeping in view the systematic\n       commercial activity carried on by the club has held that\n       the race club is an establishment within the meaning of\n       the said expression as used in the notification issued\n       under <a href=\"/doc/182541/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 1(5)</a> of the ESI Act. Therefore, in our\n       considered view, the view expressed by this Court is in\n       consonance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/88376/\" id=\"a_55\">ESI Act</a> and also\n       settled legal principles.

It is admitted, even by the petitioner, that Respondent No. 2 has\nbeen working as its South Asia correspondent for over 14 years, and\nthat the rent for the premises, from which she has been functioning\nduring the said period, has been paid for by the petitioner. In its\npleadings      before   the   Labour    Court    and   Hamburg,       the\npetitioneradmitted, further, that the office, at Golf Links, New Delhi,\nwhere Respondent No. 2 worked, was being maintained by the\npetitioner, and was being used as a residence by Respondent No. 2 at\nher own choice. It was further admitted, in the same pleadings, that\nseveral other employees, working in the said office, were also paid by\nthe petitioner. Even in respect of the staff, employees in the said\noffice, regarding whom Respondent No. 2 retained the right to hire,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                             Page 46 of 61</span>\n and fire, permission, from the petitionerat Hamburg, had necessarily\nto be obtained before taking any such decision. The salaries paid to\nthe said staff were also determined by the petitionerat Hamburg, and,\nthough disbursed physically by Respondent No. 2, was subject to\nreimbursement by the petitionerat Hamburg. The asseverations, in this\nregard, as contained in the affidavit-in-evidence tendered by\nRespondent No. 2, testifying as WW-1, and her evidence, during trial,\nas well as cross-examination, cumulatively viewed, indicates,\ninescapably, that the premises at Golf Links, in which Respondent No.\n2 lived and worked, were especially provided to her, by the petitioner,\nin order for her to discharge the duties towards the petitioner. No other\nwork was being transacted from the said premises. It is also an\nadmitted position that, during this entire period, Respondent No. 2\nwas the accredited South Asia correspondent of the petitioner. In these\ncircumstances, the premises at Golf Links, from where Respondent\nNo. 2 worked and discharged her duties as South Asiacorrespondent\nfor the petitioner, necessarily constituted part of the petitioner&#x27;s\nestablishment. The plea, of Mr. Dewan, that the petitionercould not be\nsaid to have any ―newspaper Establishment‖ in India is, therefore,\nrejected.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">53.    As Respondent No. 2 was a ―working journalist‖, ―Der Spiegel‖\nwas a ―newspaper‖, and the premises occupied by Respondent No. 2\nin New Delhi were part of the ―newspaper establishment‖ of the\npetitioner, the provisions of the Working Journalists Act clearly\napplied to the present case.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                             Page 47 of 61</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\"> 54.    It is true that the head office of the petitioneris in Hamburg,\nGermany. This fact, however, makes no difference, at all, to the\npresent case. The petitioner, having elected to open an office, in New\nDelhi, in which it had placed its ―South Asia correspondent‖, it was\nbound, qua the said establishment/office, by the laws of this country.\nRespondent No. 2, being an Indian citizen, working in India, and\nfulfilling the definition of ―workman‖, as contained in the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_56\">ID Act</a> and\nof ―working journalist‖ under the Working Journalists Act, was\nentitled, consequently, to the protection of both the said statutes. In\napplying the provisions of the Working Journalists Act, or the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_57\">ID Act</a>,\nto Respondent No. 2, therefore, the Court cannot be said to be\naccording, to either of the said statutes, any extraterritorial\napplication. The objection, of Mr. Dewan, on the said score, is also,\ntherefore, without merit.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_109\">55.    The seminal issue which arises for consideration in the present\ncase is, however, the nature of employment, of Respondent No. 2 by\nthe petitioner, and whether Respondent No. 2 could be said to have\nbeen illegally retrenched, by the petitioner, so as to entitle her to\nreinstatement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_110\">56.    The petitioner&#x27;s contention is that the relationship between\nRespondent No. 2 and the petitionerwas expressly contractual in\nnature, continued on a year-to-year basis, but bearing no semblance to\npermanent employment. Being contractual in nature, the employment\nof Respondent No. 2 could be terminated, as the petitionerwould seek\nto contend, at any point of time, and the Labour Court, therefore,\nmaterially erred in holding that the termination of the said\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                            Page 48 of 61</span>\n relationship, which was but a natural consequence of the non-\nextension, by the petitioner, of the contract with Respondent No. 2\nbeyond 30th April, 2012, was illegal. According to the petitioner, there\nwas no duty cast, on it, to continue to extend the contract of\nRespondent No. 2 in perpetuity, and Respondent No. 2 also continued\nin her employment in the full awareness of the fact that her\nrelationship, which the petitioner, was, at all times, only contractual in\nnature, till the 30th of the next April.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">57.

Firstly, the respondent has not produced any\n       material evidence on record before the Labour Court to\n       prove that it meets all the required criteria under the\n       <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_65\">Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970</a>, to\n       be eligible to employ employees on contractual basis\n       which includes licence number, etc.\n\n       28.2. Secondly, the respondent could not produce any\n       material evidence on record before the Labour Court to\n       show that the appellant was employed for any particular\n       project(s) on the completion of which his service has\n       been terminated through non-renewal of his contract of\n       employment.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 50 of 61</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">        29. Therefore, we deem it fit to construe that the\n       appellant has rendered continuous service for six\n       continuous years (save the artificially imposed break) as\n       provided under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 25-B</a> of the ID Act and can\n       therefore be subjected to retrenchment only through the\n       procedure mentioned in the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_67\">ID Act</a> or the State Act in\n       parimateria.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">       30. Therefore, we answer Point (ii) in favour of the\n       appellant holding that the Labour Court was correct in\n       holding that the action of the respondent employer is a\n       clear case of retrenchment of the appellant, which action\n       requires to comply with the mandatory requirement of\n       the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/159288390/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 6-N</a> of the U.P. ID Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">       Undisputedly, the same has not been complied with and\n       therefore, the order of retrenchment has been rendered\n       void ab initio in law.‖\n                                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">58.    Even in the letter, dated 9th April, 1998, which may be regarded\nas the terminus a quo of the relationship between the petitionerand\nRespondent No. 2, Respondent No. 2 is referred to as a ―freelance\nemployee‖ of the petitioner. There is a distinction between a person\nwho is an employee of another, and a person who is employed by\nanother. Employment of one person, by another, would conceivably\ncover all cases where money is paid by one, to another, for rendition\nof services. In contradistinction, if one is regarded as an employee of\nanother, which indicates, clearly, the existence of a jural relationship\nof employee and employer, of the character of servant and master,\nbetween the two.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">59.    The letter dated 9th April, 1998 supra goes on, further, to\nidentify the duties, of Respondent No. 2, for Spiegel Publishers,\nwhich, it is stated, would be ―along the lines specified by us in our\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                             Page 51 of 61</span>\n discussion; reportage and other writing‖. For this, the communication\ngoes on to state that Respondent No. 2 would receive a monthly\nretainer, along with a monthly payment towards the rent of the\noffice/residence at New Delhi. This arrangement, notably, continued\nfor 14 long years, and, in such circumstances, the inescapable\nconclusion is that the amount which was euphemistically being paid,\nmonth by month, to Respondent No. 2, as a ―monthly retainer‖ was, to\nall intents and purposes, salary. The distinction, being sought to be\ndrawn, by Mr. Dewan, between our ―monthly retainership‖, which\nwas being paid by the petitionerto Respondent No. 2, and salary is,\ntherefore, too tenuous to pass legal muster.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">60.    In this context, one may profitably refer to Grounds C to E in\nthe writ petition, which read thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">       ―C. FOR THAT the Ld. Labour Court failed to\n       consider that the Contract clearly designated Respondent\n       No 2 as a ―Freelance‖ employee of Respondent No. 2 (sic\n       the Petitioner). The contract was admittedly extended to\n       12 times on a year-on-year-basis, and continued\n       uninterruptedly for a period of 14 years, and Respondent\n       No 2 was never treated as a permanent employee of the\n       Petitioner.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">       D.    FOR THAT the Ld. Labour Court also failed to\n       appreciate the Respondent No 2 had herself admitted in\n       her cross-examination that ―It is correct that my\n       regularisation did not happen between 1998-2012\n       although it was promised verbally. Thus, in the absence\n       of my regularisation, during the period 1998-2012 I\n       continued as a contractual employee...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_117\">       E.    FOR THAT the Ld. Labour Court failed to\n       appreciate that Respondent No. 2 had herself admitted in\n       her pleadings that Respondent No. 2 ―was assured on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                          Page 52 of 61</span>\n        numerous occasions that she would be conferred the\n       status of permanent employee in due course&quot; and that\n       Respondent No. 2 ―was always considered as a\n       permanent employee while taking work, but treated as\n       contractual while paying for the work‖. The same clearly\n       evinces that both the parties recognise Respondent No.\n       2&#x27;s status as a freelance employee of the Petitionerand\n       not as a permanent employee. Further, Respondent No. 2\n       herself had all along treated herself as a freelancer from\n       1998 onwards and expressed reservation as to her nature\n       of engagement only towards the end of 2010.‖\n                                             (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">61.    The above passages, from the record of cross-examination of\nRespondent No. 2, as carried out by the petitionerbefore the learned\nLabour Court, on which the petitionerseeks to place reliance, are\nsignificant and revealing in equal measure. The petitioner, by placing\nreliance on the said passages, without denying any part thereof,\nimpliedly accepts everything that is stated in the said passages. The\npetitionerhas, thereby, admitted the fact that (i) the contract of\nRespondent No. 2 was extended 12 times on a year-to-year basis, (ii)\nthe said contract continued uninterruptedly for a period of 14 years,\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_119\">(iii) the petitionerverbally promised to regularise Respondent No. 2,\nbut did not do so, (iv) Respondent No. 2 was assured, on numerous\noccasions, by the petitioner, that she would be conferred the status of\npermanent employee in due course, and (v) while taking work, the\npetitionerwas always considering Respondent No. 2 as a permanent\nemployee, but while making payment to her, was treated her a\ncontractual employee. These depositions, by Respondent No. 2 in\ncross-examination before the learned Labour Court, have been relied\nupon, by the petitioner, in the writ petition, without denying any part\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                            Page 53 of 61</span>\n thereof. These facts, even by themselves, are sufficient to justify the\nfinding, of the learned Labour Court, that Respondent No. 2 was,\neffectively, a permanent employee of the petitioner, entitled to be\ntreated as such, and that the petitioner, by keeping her on contract\nuninterruptedly for 14 years, even without any artificial break, was\nclearly guilty of unfair labour practice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">62.    Interestingly, in Ground F in the writ petition, the\npetitionercandidly, though, perhaps, unwittingly, seeks to rely on the\nfact that Respondent No. 2 ―had willingly endured the contractual\nextension for 12 years‖. Having thus endured - as the petitioneritself\nadmits - being continued on contract for 12 years (actually 14 years),\nthe benefits, of such endurance, must, of needs, now enure, to her\nbenefit, as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">63.    Much has been sought to be made of the use of the expression\n―freelance‖ in the agreement, dated 9th April, 1998, between the\npetitionerand Respondent No. 2. The learned Labour Court is, in this\ncontext, perfectly correct in observing that the nature of the jural\nrelationship, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 would fall\nto be determined, not merely on the basis of the nomenclature,\nattributed to the said relationship, in the letter of appointment, but to\nthe character of the employment, as borne out from facts.             The\ncommunications, dated 4th July, 1998, 5th October, 1998, 6th October,\n1998, 17th July, 2001, 30th September, 2002, 8th October, 2003, 6th\nOctober, 2004, 26th October, 2005, 12th November, 2007, 10th\nOctober, 2008 and 18th November, 2010 from the petitionerto the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 54 of 61</span>\n Principal Information Officer, Press Information Bureau, the\ncommunication dated 7th September, 2005 from the petitionerto the\nEmbassy of the USA at New Delhi, the communication dated 12th\nJuly, 2000 from the petitionerto the Director-General, ISPR,\nIslamabad and the certificate, dated 25th October, 2011, issued by the\npetitioner, all of which formed part of the record before the learned\nLabour Court below, clearly acknowledged that Respondent No. 2\nwas the accredited South Asia correspondent of the petitioner, and\nwas based, for the said purpose, in New Delhi. The petitioneralso\nundertook to bear all expenses incidental thereto. Periodical requests,\nto the Press Information Bureau, for extension of the accreditation of\nRespondent No. 2, were made by the petitioner. Permission for\nCustoms duty exemption, on the laptop, and other items being used by\nRespondent No. 2, for discharging her functions as South Asia\ncorrespondent       of   the   petitioner,   was   also   sought,     by    the\npetitioneritself. The tenor of these communications is clear and\nunmistakable. Not only was Respondent No. 2 the South Asia\ncorrespondent of the petitioner; she also appears to have been a much-\nvalued correspondent, with the petitionergoing out of its way to ensure\nthat her tenure was comfortable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_122\">64.    The character of the employment, of Respondent No. 2, by the\npetitioner, as being that of a regular employee, is also underscored by\nher having been (i) allowed to vote, in yearly elections, to the\nemployee&#x27;s advisory Council/Union, for which she received a voting\nslip every year, (ii) issued a German press card by the Association of\nGerman Magazine Publishers North e.V, (iii) directed to report,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                                   Page 55 of 61</span>\n directly, to the petitionerat Hamburg, (iv) disbursed salary directly\nfrom Hamburg, and (v) told to maintain her work timings as per the\nwork timings at Hamburg. It is also borne out by the fact that the\nagreement, between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 was drawn in\nHamburg, the decision to run, or not to run, the stories of Respondent\nNo. 2, was taken at Hamburg, and permission from Hamburg was\nrequired even to travel in connection with work. Besides, Respondent\nNo. 2 reported solely to the Senior Foreign Editor of the petitioner-\ninstitution at Hamburg. The manner in which the petitionerused to\nfunction, as testified by her during cross-examination, and as extracted\nin para 12 supra, also indicates, clearly and unmistakably, that\nRespondent No. 2 was working as a paid employee of the petitioner,\ndedicated entirely to the work of the petitioner. The submission, of\nMr. Dewan , that there was no embargo on Respondent No. 2 working\nfor anyone else, and that, if she did not do so, it was of her own will\nand volition, is too facile to meet with approval; the character of the\nrelationship between the petitionerand Respondent No. 2 was, clearly,\nsuch     that       Respondent   No.   2   regarded   herself,   and     the\npetitionerregarded Respondent No. 2, as working solely for the\npetitioner. These facts emerged from the evidence during trial,\nsubstantially from the examination-in-chief of Respondent No. 2, and\nher cross-examination by the petitioner, and, in the light thereof, the\nLabour Court could not be said to have acted illegally, far less with\nany hint of perversity, in holding that Respondent No. 2 was the\nemployee of the petitioner, and of the petitioneralone. Reliance on the\nword ‗freelance&#x27; cannot, in any manner, reflect the nature of her\nemployment. In fact, the terms of the agreement, as stated above,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                                Page 56 of 61</span>\n clearly indicate that the control over her working, the remuneration\npayable, the timings to be maintained as per work timings at\nHamburg, travel which she had to undertake, only with the permission\nof the petitioner at Hamburg, duly to report to the senior officials at\nHamburg, militate against the agreement being one of work as a\n‗freelance&#x27; as legally understood, as meaning ―a self employed person\noffering services not under contract to any single employer‖\n(Chambers 21st century Dictionary, Reprinted 1998). The Respondent\nNo. 2 was admittedly not working for anyone else and, as far as her\nworking is concerned, she was completely controlled by the\npetitioner&#x27;s officials at Hamburg. The agreement that she was a\n‗freelancer&#x27;, therefore fails. She has, therefore, also to be regarded as a\n―working journalist‖, within the meaning of the Working Journalists\nAct, and as a ―workman‖ within the meaning of the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_69\">ID Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">65.    Significantly, even in the letter dated 22nd February, 2012\nsupra, whereby the petitioner sought to inform Respondent No. 2 that\nher contract would not be extended beyond April 2012, it so states that\nRespondent No. 2 would not, therefore, be entitled to any ―monthly\nsalary or fee thereafter‖. The use of the words ―monthly salary‖\nindicates, unmistakably, that the petitioner recognised that Respondent\nNo. 2 had been its salaried employee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_124\">66.    Apropos the Income Tax returns filed by Respondent No. 2,\nMr. Tripathi has submitted that the manner in which Respondent No.\n2 may have classified her income, in the said returns, and the\ndeductions claimed on the basis thereof, cannot decide the jural\nrelationship between her, and the petitioner. In case the petitionerwas,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                               Page 57 of 61</span>\n in fact, paying salary to Respondent No. 2, that fact would not stand\ndiscountenanced by the declaration, by Respondent No. 2, of the\namounts received, by her, from the petitioner, as income from\nbusiness/profession, or by the claiming of deduction, by her, of the\nsaid amount, on that count. At worst, it could constitute the basis for\nthe Income Tax authorities to deny the said deduction. In case\nRespondent No. 2 has already availed the benefit of the said\ndeduction, that, too, cannot estop her from contending, in the present\ncase, that she was a permanent employee of the petitioner, or at least\nentitled to be regarded as such.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"162304628\" id=\"span_77\">67.    The judgment, of a coordinate Single Bench of this Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/162304628/\" id=\"a_70\">New Era Impex (India) Pvt Ltd</a>, Supra, on which learned counsel for\nthe petitionerseeks to place reliance, is clearly distinguishable. In the\nsaid case, the issue related to monies advanced by the plaintiff to the\ndefendant. The fact of advancing of the monies was not in dispute.\nThe defendant sought to contend that, though, in the financial books,\nthe said amounts were described as advance, that was only by way of\naccounting convenience, whereas the amounts were actually in the\nnature of gift, given out of natural love and affection, and that they\nwere never intended to be recovered as loan or repaid, which was the\nreason why neither of the companies that the on the said amounts as\npayable expense, or receivable income. It was in this context that the\nlearned Single Judge, deciding the suit of the plaintiff, against the\ndefendant, held that, once the defendant had characterised the\namounts, received from the plaintiff, in its books of accounts, and\nbefore the taxation authorities, as advance, it could not be permitted to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 58 of 61</span>\n urge, before the Civil Court, that the said money was a gift of love and\naffection. The learned Single Judge also observed that, under <a href=\"/doc/881325/\" id=\"a_71\">Section\n122</a> of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a corporate entity could not\nmake a gift without consideration or part with thisfund in such a\nmanner. As against this, the controversy, in the present case,\nessentially revolves around the relationship, between the petitionerand\nRespondent No. 2. The fact of payment of monthly amounts, by the\npetitionerto Respondent No. 2, is not denied. The fact of discharge of\nduties, by Respondent No. 2, for the petitioner, for 14 years, also\nstands established. What falls for consideration, in such a situation, is\nwhether the said amounts would be treated, not as salary, but only as a\n―monthly retainer‖. The income tax returns filed by Respondent No. 2\nare only being relied upon, by the petitioner, to indicate that\nRespondent No. 2 had claimed deductions, on the said amounts,\ntreating them as business from income/profession.</span> The factual and\nlegal backdrop of the controversy, in the present case, is entirely\ndistinguishable from that which arose in New Era Impex (supra).\nOnce all other factors, seen in the light of the applicable law, indicate\nthat Respondent No. 2 was, in fact, being treated as a permanent\nemployee of the petitioner, and was discharging duties as such, under\nthe control of the petitionerand as per the details of the petitioner, for\nwhich Respondent No. 2 was receiving a monthly payment, twelve\ntimes a year, it would be facile to hold that the said payment was not\n―salary‖, irrespective of how Respondent No. 2 may, or may not, have\ntreated the said amounts, while filing her income tax returns. The\nreliance, on the said returns, by the petitionerhas, therefore, to be\nnecessarily characterised as misplaced.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">W.P.(C) 1841/2018                                              Page 59 of 61</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\"> 68.
