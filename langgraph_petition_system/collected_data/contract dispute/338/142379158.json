This judgment disposes of Arb. P. 217/2020 and OMP (I)\n                            (Comm) 162/2020.\n\n\n                            2.    Arb. P. 217/2020 seeks reference of the disputes, between the\n                            petitioner and respondent, to arbitration, under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\n                            Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the\n                            1996 Act&quot;). OMP (I) (Comm) 162/2020 seeks certain pre-arbitral\n                            interim reliefs.   Mr. Viswanathan, learned Senior Counsel for the\n                            petitioner submitted, at the outset, that, if Arb. P. 217/2020 were to be\n                            allowed, and the disputes between the petitioner and the respondent\n                            referred to arbitration as prayed therein, he would have no objection to\n                            OMP (I) (Comm) 162/2020 being also referred for adjudication to the\n                            arbitrator, treating it as an application under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 17</a> of the 1996\n                            Act. As such, the necessity of adjudicating, on merits, OMP (I)\n                            (Comm) 162/2020 would arise only if Arb. P. 217/2020 were not to be\n                            allowed.\n\n\n                            3.    Mr. Tejas Karia, learned counsel for the respondent, vehemently\n                            opposed Arb. P. 217/2020. The ground for opposition would become\n                            clearer from the recital that follows. Suffice it to state, at this stage,\n                            that I am of the opinion that the opposition of Mr. Tejas Karia is\n                            without substance and that, therefore, the dispute between the\n                            petitioner and the respondent ought to be referred to arbitration. As\n                            such, in view of the submission made by Mr. Viswanathan, noted\n                            supra, OMP (I) (Comm) 162/2020 would also be decided by the\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                 Page 2 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 17</a> of the 1996 Act. The necessity of\n                            this Court adjudicating on the said petition, thereby, stands obviated.\n\n\n                            Facts\n\n\n                            4.

As already noted at the commencement of the present\n                            judgment, Mr. Viswanathan, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner\n                            agreed to OMP (I) (Comm) 162/2020 being adjudicated by the\n                            Arbitral Tribunal, to be constituted in accordance with the prayer\n                            contained in Arb P 217/2020, treating the OMP as an application\n                            under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 17</a> of the 1996 Act.\n\n\n                            24.

The respondent opposes, in writing as well as orally through\n                            Mr. Tejas Karia, Arb.

The GCC had not been signed by both parties.\n                                  The Integrity Pact conferred jurisdiction exclusively on Courts\n                                  at Faridabad. As such, this Court does not possess territorial\n                                  jurisdiction to entertain the present matter.\n\n\n                                  (ii)   The petition was not maintainable, as it was based on a\n                                  &quot;proposed EPC contract&quot;, which had never come into existence,\n                                  as it was never signed by the respondent.

As against this, the petitioners in its first written submissions,\n                            dated 1st July, 2020, contended thus:\n\n\n                                  (i)    Clause 6.3.2 of the GCC specifically required any dispute\n                                  relating to the contract to be settled by arbitration in accordance\n                                  with the rules of arbitration of the DIAC.

A concluded contract\n                                      came into being only when such counter proposal was accepted\n                                      by the original proposer.

In\n                                  these circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the parties\n                                  had acted upon the terms of the contract though it was signed by\n                                  only one party and not by the other. In the present case, though\n                                  the Letters of Award dated 20th September, 2019 were issued by\n                                  the respondent to the petitioners, the petitioners failed to take\n                                  steps in accordance with the said Letters of Award, resulting in\n                                  non-conclusion of the contract.

The test of\n                                     &quot;good arguable case&quot; has been elaborated by the England and\n                                     Wales High Court in Silver Dry Bulk Company\n                                     Limited v. Homer Hulbert Maritime Company Limited 20, in\n                                     the following words:\n\n                                               &quot;Good arguable case&quot; is an expression which has been\n                                               hallowed by long usage, but it means different things\n                                               in different contexts. For the purpose of an application\n                                               under <a href=\"/doc/1270593/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 18</a>, I would hold that what must be\n                                               shown is a case which is somewhat more than merely\n                                               arguable, but need not be one which appears more\n                                               likely than not to succeed. It shall use the term &quot;good\n                                               arguable case&quot; in that sense. It represents a relatively\n                                               low threshold which retains flexibility for the Court to\n                                               do what is just, while excluding those cases where the\n                                               jurisdictional merits were so low that reluctant\n                                               respondents ought not to be put to the expense and\n                                               trouble of having to decide how to deal with arbitral\n                                               proceedings where it was very likely that the tribunal\n                                               had no jurisdiction. In this connection it is important to\n                                               remember that crossing the threshold of &quot;good\n                                               arguable case&quot; means that the Court has power to\n                                               make one of the orders listed in <a href=\"/doc/625330/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 18(3)</a>. It\n                                               remains for consideration whether it should do so as a\n                                               matter of discretion.&quot;\n\n                                     124.

The latter part of\n                                                the exercise adverted to above, which involves\n                                                correlating the dispute with the arbitration agreement\n                                                obtaining between the parties, is an aspect which is\n                                                implicitly embedded in sub-section (6A) of <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 11</a>\n                                                of the 1996 Act, which, otherwise, requires the Court\n                                                to confine its examination only to the existence of the\n                                                arbitration agreement. Therefore, if on a bare perusal\n                                                of the agreement it is found that a particular dispute is\n                                                not relatable to the arbitration agreement, then,\n                                                perhaps, the Court may decline the relief sought for by\n                                                a party in a <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 11</a> petition. However, if there is a\n                                                contestation with regard to the issue as to whether the\n                                                dispute falls within the realm of the arbitration\n                                                agreement, then, the best course would be to allow the\n                                                arbitrator to form a view in the matter.\n\n                                                59.2 Thus, unless it is in a manner of speech, a chalk\n                                                and cheese situation or a black and white situation\n                                                without shades of grey, the concerned court hearing\n                                                the <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 11</a> petition should follow the more\n                                                conservative course of allowing parties to have their\n                                                say before the arbitral tribunal.&quot;\n\n                                       125. The nature and facet of non-arbitrability could also\n                                       determine the level and nature of scrutiny by the court at the\n                                       referral stage. Stravos Brekoulakis has differentiated between\n                                       contractual aspects of arbitration agreement which the court\n                                       can examine at referral stage and jurisdictional aspects of\n                                       arbitration agreement which he feels should be left to the\n                                       arbitral tribunal. John J. Barcelo III, referring to some\n                                       American decisions had divided the issue of non-arbitrability\n                                       into procedural and substantive objections. The procedurals\n                                       are &#x27;gateway questions&#x27; which would presumptively be for\n                                       the arbitrator to decide at least at the first stage. In the Indian\n                                       context, we would respectfully adopt the three categories\n                                       in Boghara Polyfab Private Limited 22.

Such questions arise rarely and, when they arise,\n                                  are on most occasions questions of law.

Undertaking a detailed\n                                  full review or a long-drawn review at the referral stage would\n                                  obstruct and cause delay undermining the integrity and\n                                  efficacy of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism.\n                                  Conversely, if the court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it\n                                  may undermine effectiveness of both the arbitration and the\n                                  court. There are certain cases where the prima\n                                  facie examination may require a deeper consideration.

If the challenge requires the production and\n                                                review of factual evidence, the court should normally\n                                                refer the case to arbitration, as arbitrators have, for\n                                                this purpose, the same resources and expertise as\n                                                courts. Where questions of mixed law and fact are\n                                                concerned, the court hearing the referral application\n                                                must refer the case to arbitration unless the questions\n                                                of fact require only superficial consideration of the\n                                                documentary evidence in the record.\n\n                                                86.    Before departing from the general rule of\n                                                referral, the court must be satisfied that the challenge\n                                                to the arbitrator&#x27;s jurisdiction is not a delaying tactic\n                                                and that it will not unduly impair the conduct of the\n                                                arbitration proceeding.

On jurisprudentially and textualism it is\n                                       possible to differentiate between existence of an arbitration\n                                       agreement and validity of an arbitration agreement. Such\n                                       interpretation can draw support from the plain meaning of the\n                                       word &quot;existence&#x27;. However, it is equally possible,\n                                       jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to hold that an\n                                       agreement has no existence if it is not enforceable and not\n                                       binding. Existence of an arbitration agreement presupposes a\n                                       valid agreement which would be enforced by the court by\n                                       relegating the parties to arbitration. Legalistic and plain\n                                       meaning interpretation would be contrary to the contextual\n                                       background including the definition clause and would result\n                                       in unpalatable consequences. A reasonable and just\n                                       interpretation of &#x27;existence&#x27; requires understanding the\n                                       context, the purpose and the relevant legal norms applicable\n                                       for a binding and enforceable arbitration agreement. An\n                                       agreement evidenced in writing has no meaning unless the\n                                       parties can be compelled to adhere and abide by the terms. A\n                                       party cannot sue and claim rights based on an unenforceable\n                                       document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that an\n                                       arbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal.

The object and purpose behind the\n                                        two provisions is identical to compel and force parties\n                                        to abide by their contractual understanding. This being\n                                        so, the two provisions should be read as laying down\n                                        similar standard and not as laying down different and\n                                        separate parameters. <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 11</a> does not prescribe any\n                                        standard of judicial review by the court for\n                                        determining whether an arbitration agreement is in\n                                        existence. <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 8</a> states that the judicial review at\n                                        the stage of reference is prima facie and not\n                                        final.

It has been made unmistakably clear that, in exercise of its\n                            limited scope of authority, to examine the questions of existence of\n                            the arbitration agreement and arbitrability of the dispute, at the\n                            referral stage, the Court has to be careful not to usurp the jurisdiction\n                            of the arbitral tribunal which, ideally, should examine these aspects.\n                            The scope of examination by the referral court under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 11(6)</a>,\n                            into the aspects of existence of the arbitration agreement, or\n                            arbitrability of the dispute, is, strictly, prima facie. In other words, it\n                            is only if, prima facie, the Court finds that no valid arbitration\n                            agreement exists, that it would refuse to refer the dispute to\n                            arbitration. In undertaking this exercise, the Court should not get lost\n                            in thickets, or enter into debatable factual issues. Unless there are\n                            good and substantial reasons to the contrary, the Court is required to\n                            compel the parties to abide by the arbitration agreement. It is only in\n                            the case where the arbitration agreement is &quot;ex facie non-existent or\n                            invalid&quot;, or the dispute is ex facie non-arbitrable, that the court would\n                            refuse to refer the dispute to arbitration. The intention is &quot;to cut off\n                            the deadwood and trim off the side branches in straightforward cases\n                            where dismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and\n                            law the litigation must stop at the first stage&quot;, and to ensure that\n                            &quot;vexatious and frivolous matters get over at the initial stage&quot;.

The scope\n                            of examination at this stage is preliminary and summary and not in the\n                            nature of a mini-trial.\n\n\n                            32.   The Supreme Court also clarified that the &quot;existence&quot; of the\n                            arbitral agreement also included, within its scope, the enforceability\n                            thereof, as an unenforceable agreement could not be regarded as\n                            &quot;existing&quot;. As such, existence and validity were intertwined. An\n                            arbitration agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does not satisfy\n                            the mandate of the legal requirements. An invalid agreement is no\n                            agreement.     &quot;Existence&quot; and &quot;validity&quot; were, to an extent, even\n                            synonymous. Examples were cited, to clarify the position, as in the\n                            case of an agreement with the minor, or a lunatic, or where the only\n                            claim was for probate of a will.\n\n\n                            33.   It has been made further clear that the dispute would be\n                            regarded as &quot;non-arbitrable&quot;, at the <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 8</a> or <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 11</a> stage, only\n                            where the nature of the dispute is ex facie non-arbitrable, or where the\n                            dispute does not relate to the arbitration agreement.

In all other cases, the <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 11</a> court should follow\n                            the more conservative course of allowing the parties to have their say\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                 Page 59 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             before the arbitral tribunal.

The conferral of such\n                            limited jurisdiction is intended &quot;to prevent wastage of public and\n                            private resources&quot;, and to protect parties from being forced to arbitrate\n                            when the matter is clearly non-arbitrable.

This position was alternately exposited, by the Supreme Court,\n                            as clarifying that the requirement of the court was &quot;to see if the\n                            underlying contract contains an arbitration clause for arbitration of the\n                            disputes which have arisen between the parties - nothing more,\n                            nothing less&quot;. The court was permitted to interfere at the referral\n                            stage &quot;only when it is manifest that the claims are ex facie time-barred\n                            and dead, or there is no subsisting dispute&quot;, all other cases requiring to\n                            be referred to the arbitral tribunal for decision on merits. The position\n                            was summed up by holding that &quot;in case of debatable and disputable\n                            facts and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the court would force\n                            the parties to abide by the arbitration agreement as the arbitral tribunal\n                            has primary jurisdiction and authority to decide the disputes including\n                            the question of jurisdiction and non-arbitrability&quot;.\n\n\n                            36.   Significantly, the Supreme Court opined that, in the case of\n                            pure commercial disputes, the more appropriate principle of\n                            interpretation would be one of liberal construction, as there was a\n                            presumption in favour of one-stop adjudication.\n\n\n                            37.   On the aspect of examination of the arbitrability of the dispute\n                            at the referral stage, the Supreme Court held that &quot;the court by default\n                            would refer the matter when contentions regarding to non-arbitrability\n                            are plainly arguable; when consideration in summary proceedings\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                 Page 61 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             would be insufficient and inclusive; when facts are contested; when\n                            the party opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs\n                            conduct of arbitration proceedings&quot;, cautioning the court not to usurp\n                            the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, but to affirm and uphold the\n                            integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution\n                            mechanism.\n\n\n                            38.        Nearly two decades ago, an Hon&#x27;ble Single Judge of the\n                            Supreme Court had, in Nimet Resources. Inc. v. Esaar Steel Ltd 35,\n                            expressed much the same view, by holding that &quot;in a matter where\n                            there has been some transaction between the parties and the existence\n                            of the arbitration agreement is in challenge, the proper course for the\n                            parties is to thrash out such question under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 16</a> of the Act and\n                            not under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 11</a> of the Act&quot;.\n\n\n                            39.        Nimet Resources16, I may note, was subsequently followed by\n                            the Supreme Court in Unissi1, which was also a case in which the\n                            formal contract was signed by one of the parties, on which Mr.\n                            Viswanathan placed reliance. Unissi1 also involved a case in which\n                            the contract had not been signed by both parties. Even so, in para 19\n                            of the report, the Supreme Court concluded thus:\n                                       &quot;Therefore, considering the above aspects of the matter in this\n                                       case, we must come to this conclusion that no formal\n                                       agreement was executed, the tender documents indicating\n                                       certain conditions of contract contained an arbitration clause.\n                                       It is also an admitted position that the appellant gave his\n                                       tender offer which was accepted and the appellant acted on it.\n                                       Accordingly, we are of the view that the learned Additional\n                                       District Judge, Chandigarh erred in holding that there did not\n\n                            35\n                                 (2000) 7 SCC 497\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                       Page 62 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                                   exist any arbitration agreement between the parties and,\n                                  therefore, the order passed by him is liable to be set aside.&quot;\n\n\n                            40.   Can the objection, of Mr. Karia, be regarded as so impressive,\n                            as to reject the prayer for referring the disputes to arbitration, applying\n                            the standards prescribed in Vidya Drolia16 ? I think not. In my view,\n                            all the issues raised by Mr. Karia, in opposition to the case set up by\n                            the petitioner for reference of dispute to arbitration, stand answered by\n                            the aforesaid decisions.\n\n\n                            41.   Unquestionably, the parties - including the respondent - have\n                            acted in accordance with the covenants of the GCC. As has been\n                            correctly pointed out by Mr. Viswanathan, consequent to issuing of\n                            the letters of award, the respondent called upon the petitioner to\n                            perform in accordance with the said letters. In these circumstances, it\n                            would be appropriate for the issue of the existence of the arbitration\n                            agreement to be examined, not by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 11(6)</a>, but\n                            by the Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act.\n\n\n                            42.   Nevertheless, given the opposition put up by Mr. Karia to the\n                            very issue of existence of an arbitration agreement, the matter may be\n                            examined in somewhat greater detail.\n\n\n                            43.   For this purpose, it would be appropriate to proceed\n                            sequentially, through the various agreements and communications, in\n                            the present case.\n\n\n                            44.

Sub-clause (vi) therein required the sub-contractor to\n                            submit a Performance Bank Guarantee (hereinafter referred to as\n                            PBG), equivalent to 5% of the value of work sub-let to it.

Clause 4 required the\n                            work to be completed within 10 years of Notice of Award/Letter of\n                            Award.\n\n\n                            45.    The covenants of the ITB were, to a large extent, overlapping\n                            with those of the NIT. Clause 3.2.A.1.2 of the ITB replicated the\n                            corresponding clause in the NIT. The requirement of an Integrity Pact\n                            is to be found in Clause 3.7 of the ITB, which required the bidder to\n                            submit an Integrity Pact, duly signed, as per Clause 33 of the ITB.\n                            The format of the Integrity Pact was contained in Annexure 2 to the\n                            ITB.\n\n\n                            46.    Clause 27 of the ITB set out the &quot;Award Criteria&quot;.

Three\n                            contracts were to be executed, the first for supply of plant, equipment\n                            and materials, the second for providing services and the third for\n                            comprehensive operation and maintenance after commissioning of the\n                            project.

The said clause went on to state in clear and\n                            categorical terms, that &quot;the notification of award (would) constitute\n                            the formation of the contract and (would) be considered for all\n                            purposes of execution of contract provisions till such time the signing\n                            of the Contract Agreement&quot;.

Clause 30 of the ITB required the employer to prepare a\n                            Contract Agreement.

I may note that there is no other\n                            reference, either in the NIT or in the ITB of the &quot;notice of readiness&quot;\n                            of the &quot;Contract Agreement&quot;.\n\n\n                            48.

Clause 31.2 provided that, in the event of\n                            failure, by the bidder, to comply with Clause 30 or Clause 31.1, the\n                            employer i.e. the respondent could annul the award and forfeit the bid\n                            security.

The specifics of the Integrity Pact were to be found in\n                            Annexure-2 to the ITB.

Annexure-2A to the ITB contained the &quot;Guidelines on Banning\n                            of Business Dealings&quot;. Clauses 4.0 and 5.0 dealt with suspension of\n                            business dealings and the procedure to be followed in respect thereof,\n                            and Clauses 6.0 and 7.0 dealt with banning business dealings. Clause\n                            7.4 contemplated issuance of a Show Cause Notice.

In the present case, the recital of facts hereinabove indicate,\n                            prima facie, that the respondent has proceeded in accordance with this\n                            procedure, by first suspending the business dealings with the\n                            petitioner, thereafter, banning business dealings and, thereafter,\n                            issuing the Show Cause Notice.\n\n\n                            54.

It is not necessary to go into the various clauses of the GCC.\n                            Suffice it to state that Clause 6.3 provided for arbitration as the mode\n                            of resolution of dispute between the parties.\n\n\n                            57.   Vide letter dated 30th November, 2018, the respondent informed\n                            the petitioner that its bid had been found techno-commercially\n                            responsive treating Y2G as the sub-contractor under Clause 3.2.A.1.2\n                            of the NIT/ITB. Thereafter, the auction took place and the petitioner\n                            emerged as the successful bidder. After several extensions of the\n                            period of validity of the bid of the petitioner, the respondent issued\n                            three LOAs, on 20th September, 2019, to the petitioner, in accordance\n                            with Clause 27 of the ITB, which contemplated the execution of three\n                            contracts.\n\n\n                            58.   Para 2.0 of each of the said LOAs, dated 20th September, 2019,\n                            clearly stated that the respondent accepted the petitioner&#x27;s proposal\n                            and awarded the petitioner the contract for the work. Para 3.0 of each\n                            of the said Letters of Award made cross-reference to the award, to the\n                            petitioner, of the other two contracts and went on to caution the\n                            petitioner that the &quot;breach of any one contract (would) automatically\n                            be construed as breach of other contracts&quot;, resulting in a right, to\n                            NHPC, to recover liquidated damages under Clause 26.2 of the GCC\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020               Page 69 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             or terminate the other contracts.

Para 6.0 of the LOAs called upon the\n                            petitioner to prepare and finalise the contract documents for filing of\n                            the formal contract document, within 28 days from the LoA - which\n                            is, alternatively, referred to as &quot;notification of the award&quot;.\n\n\n                            59.   Prima facie, by virtue of Clause 29.1 of the ITB, with the\n                            communications of the aforesaid three LOAs/notification of award to\n                            the petitioner, a contract had come into being between the petitioner\n                            and the respondent, which would continue to remain in force till the\n                            formal contract agreements were signed.\n\n\n                            60.

It is in the backdrop of these facts, that I am required to\n                            examine whether a clear case for holding that no arbitration agreement\n                            existed between the parties, as there was no concluded Contract\n                            Agreement between them, save and except for the Integrity Pact, as\n                            Mr. Tejas Karia would seek to contend, exists, so as to non-suit the\n                            petitioner entirely, or whether this issue ought to be left for decision\n                            by an Arbitral Tribunal, to be constituted by this Court.\n\n\n                            63.   The first contention of Mr. Karia is that the invocation, by the\n                            petitioner, of Clause 6.3 of the GCC, was unjustified in law, as the\n                            only concluded agreement between the parties was the Integrity Pact.\n                            The judgements cited hereinabove make it clear that the mere non-\n                            signing of the contract by both parties does not conclude the issue,\n                            especially where there are other correspondences and transactions\n                            between them, or the parties have acted on the basis of the covenants\n                            of the unsigned contract. Unissi1 appears to have dealt with a similar\n                            situation, and the attempt of Mr Karia to distinguish the said decision\n                            on the basis of some facts which may not obtain in the present case\n                            may be open to debate, especially in the light of the observations\n                            contained in para 19 of the report in the said case, already reproduced\n                            hereinbefore. The fact that the Integrity Pact is essentially in the\n                            nature of an Annexure to the Bid Documents, may also be relevant.\n                            Another consideration, to which Mr. Viswanathan has correctly\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                Page 71 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             alluded, is that an arbitration agreement exists independent of the main\n                            contract, and the unenforceability of the main contract, even if\n                            presumed, does not invalidate, or render unenforceable, the arbitration\n                            agreement. Besides, the effect of Clause 29.1 of the ITB also merits\n                            examination.\n\n\n                            64.

Mr. Viswanathan contested, inter alia, the legality of\n                            such annulment. The letter dated 2nd March, 2020 cites, as a\n                            justification for the decision to annul the LOAs, (i) failure, on the part\n                            of the petitioner, to submit the Performance Bank Guarantee @ 5%\n                            from Y2G, for the value of work sublet, along with Joint Deed of\n                            Undertaking, as well as the Integrity Pact signed by Y2G and (ii)\n                            failure, on the part of the petitioner, to sign the Contract Agreement\n                            within the extended time provided by the respondent. Annulment of\n                            the LOAs is contemplated by Clause 31.2 of the ITB. (It may require\n                            consideration whether, having invoked Clause 31.2 of the ITB, it is\n                            open to the respondent to contend that the only contractual document,\n                            signed between the parties, having effect in law, was the Integrity\n                            Act.) Clause 31.2 permits annulment of the LOAs on failure, of the\n                            bidder, to comply with Clause 30 or Clause 31.1 of the ITB. Clause\n                            31.1 envisages furnishing, by the bidder, of performance security as\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                Page 72 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             per Clause 13.3 of the GCC.        (Here, again, it becomes arguable\n                            whether the respondent can, on the one hand, allege infraction of\n                            Clause 31.1 of the ITB and, simultaneously, contend that the GCC was\n                            not enforceable.)       Clause 13.3 of the GCC does not envisage\n                            furnishing of any bank guarantee by the subcontractor.         It merits\n                            consideration, therefore, whether non-furnishing of the 5% bank\n                            guarantee by Y2G can be treated as constituting non-compliance with\n                            Clause 31.1 of the ITB. Similarly, Clause 30 of the ITB undoubtedly\n                            envisages signing of the Contract Agreement within 14 days of receipt\n                            of notice of readiness by the employer, i.e. by the respondent. Mr.\n                            Viswanathan has disputed the mandatory nature of the said 14-day\n                            period, once the respondent had itself extended the period. As to\n                            whether the said 14-day period is, therefore, of the essence of the\n                            contractual relationship between the petitioner and respondent also,\n                            therefore, becomes arguable. In sum, the legality of the decision, of\n                            the respondent, to annul the LOAs, is open to debate.                The\n                            justifiability of the reliance, by the respondent, on the said\n                            &quot;annulment&quot;, vide the communication dated 2nd March, 2020 is also,\n                            therefore, debatable.\n\n\n                            65.   Issues relating to formation of the contract, as well as its\n                            existence and validity have, expressly, been held, in Vidya Drolia16,\n                            to, ideally, merit resolution by the arbitral process, rather than by the\n                            referral Court, especially where the contract is commercial in nature.\n\n\n                            66.   Mr. Karia next contended that the actions against the petitioner\n                            had been taken under the Integrity Pact, and not under the main\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                Page 73 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             contract.   This, in my view, is highly contestable.        There is no\n                            reference to the Integrity Pact, in the letter, dated 2nd March 2020,\n                            proposing to annul the LOAs, the communication dated 9th March,\n                            2020, informing the petitioner that it had been decided to ban business\n                            dealings with it, or the Show Cause Notice dated 19th June, 2020. Nor\n                            do the allegations, contained in these communications, prima facie,\n                            relate to any of the commitments of the petitioner, under the Integrity\n                            Pact, or allege, directly or indirectly, collusion, corruption, or any\n                            other such misfeasance. The submission of Mr. Viswanathan, that the\n                            respondent has sought to piggyback on the Integrity Pact, only in its\n                            response to the present petition of the petitioner, so as to defeat the\n                            petition also, therefore, merits consideration. It cannot be said that the\n                            material on record unequivocally discloses that the communications\n                            from the respondents to the petitioner, with which the petitioner is\n                            aggrieved, have been issued under the Integrity Pact.\n\n\n                            67.   The objection to territorial jurisdiction being also premised on\n                            the contention that, apart from the Integrity Pact, there was no\n                            concluded contract between the petitioner and the respondent, I am not\n                            convinced that the present petition can be dismissed as incompetent\n                            before this Court.\n\n\n                            68.   Mr. Karia also sought to invoke <a href=\"/doc/74115/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 7</a> of the Contract Act,\n                            in juxtaposition with his contention that the petitioner had failed to\n                            comply with the requirements of the LOAs.            This contention is,\n                            however, premised on the assumption that the LOAs constituted offers\n                            and that, sans any unconditional acceptance of these offers, no\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                Page 74 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             contract came into being. Mr. Viswanathan contends, per contra, that\n                            the very issuance of the LOAs indicated acceptance of the petitioner&#x27;s\n                            bids, in terms of the Bid Documents, which included the GCC - for\n                            which purpose reliance is placed on Clause 6.1 of the ITB. This,\n                            again, is an arguable issue, which ought, appropriately, to be examined\n                            by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n\n                            69.   All other questions on which the petitioner and respondent have\n                            joined issue, clearly, are amenable to resolution by the arbitral\n                            process, given the overarching jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal\n                            under the provisions of the 1996 Act, including, inter alia, <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 16</a>.\n                            I do not deem it necessary or appropriate to deal with all the\n                            submissions, here. I am, nevertheless, constrained to hold that Mr.\n                            Karia has not been able to make out a case either of clear non-\n                            existence of the arbitration agreement, contained in Clause 6.3 of the\n                            GCC, within the Vidya Drolia16 parameters. The issue is, at the very\n                            least, arguable, and, especially given the fact that it relates to purely\n                            commercial contracts, ought, in my view, to be agitated before the\n                            learned Arbitral Tribunal which, in its kompetenz-kompetenz\n                            jurisdiction, is well within its authority to pronounce on the existence\n                            of the arbitration agreement as well.\n\n\n                            70.   The prayer for referring of the disputes to arbitration, as\n                            contained in Arb. P. 217/2020, therefore, deserves to succeed.\n\n\n\n\nSignature Not Verified\nDigitally Signed By:SUNIL\nSINGH NEGI\n                            ARB.P. 217/2020 &amp; O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 162/2020                Page 75 of 76\nSigning Date:19.02.2021\n09:08:48\n                             Conclusion\n\n\n                            71.      Accordingly, Arb. P. 217/2020 is allowed.        The disputes\n                            between the petitioner and respondent are referred for arbitration to\n                            the Delhi International Arbitration Centre. The Delhi International\n                            Arbitration Centre would proceed in the matter in accordance with the\n                            various subclauses of Clause 6.3 of the General Conditions of\n                            Contract and in accordance with the DIAC (Arbitration Proceedings)\n                            Rules, 2018. The DIAC would appoint a suitable sole arbitrator to\n                            arbitrate on the disputes, out of the panel maintained by it or as\n                            otherwise agreed between the parties.\n\n\n                            72.      The learned arbitrator, appointed by the DIAC, would proceed\n                            with the matter uninfluenced by the observations contained in this\n                            judgement, which are only intended to address the objections, of Mr\n                            Karia, regarding the very maintainability of the present proceedings,\n                            especially regarding the existence, or otherwise, of the arbitration\n                            agreement. On all aspects, including the existence of the arbitration\n                            agreement as well as the arbitrability of the dispute, therefore, the\n                            learned arbitrator would be free to take a view, unencumbered by this\n                            judgement or the opinions expressed therein, which are merely prima\n                            facie.\n\n\n                            73.
