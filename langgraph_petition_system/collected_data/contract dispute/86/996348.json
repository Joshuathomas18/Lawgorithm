The \ndispute was specifically referred to arbitration in terms of notice dated 10th \nApril, 1998.

In any \nevent, Clause 4.0 has no relevance to the exchange loss dispute.  BSCL \nacted contrary to the agreed terms as it made payment upon applying the \nfixed exchange rate of Rs. 100 = US$8.575.  BSCL was to pay to MII the \namount as per the current rate, only on reconciliation MII was to refund the \nexcess amount to BSCL which ensured that exchange loss would be shared \nby both the parties.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">Re: Uninvoiced Claims\n\n \tBSCL never raised any objection before the Arbitrator that the claim \nfor US$ 2,300,200 for procurement of structural material could not be raised \nin view of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act.  Invoice \nin any event, is merely a basis for claim and such a claim may be raised in \ncorrespondences as also in the meetings.  The claim for US$ 2,300,200 was \nnot strictly claim for damages, as in terms of the contract BSCL was \nrequired to procure the steel and as it being not in a position to do so, MII \nagreed to procure the same on its behalf if BSCL would agree to pay US$ \n2,300,200 to cover MII&#x27;s cost for accelerated procurement and other costs.  \nThis offer was the subject matter of correspondence between the parties.  As \nno dispute was raised to recover the same amount from BSCL, procurement \njob was undertaken.  The finding arrived at by the learned Arbitrator in this \nbehalf is entirely a finding of fact. Reference to Clause 5 of the Contract was \nwholly irrelevant.  This clause provides that BSCL shall procure suitable \nsteel for &quot;jackets&#x27; on replacement basis for MII purchased steel. BSCL did \nnot procure the required amount of steel to replace the structural materials \nthat MII provided from its inventory as an accommodation to BSCL.

It has \nembodied the relevant rules of the modern law but does not contain all the \nprovisions thereof.  The 1996 Act, however, is not as extensive as the \n<a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_26\">English Arbitration Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">\tDifferent statutes operated in the field in respect of a domestic award \nand a foreign award prior to coming into force of the 1996 Act, namely, the \n1940 <a href=\"/doc/777085/\" id=\"a_27\">Act, the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937</a> and the \n<a href=\"/doc/142812771/\" id=\"a_28\">Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961</a>.

Such a question of jurisdiction could \nbe raised if it is beyond the scope of his authority.  It was required to be \nraised during arbitration proceedings or soon after initiation thereof.  The \njurisdictional question is required to be determined as a preliminary ground.  \nA decision taken thereupon by the Arbitrator would be subject matter of \nchallenge under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 34</a> of the Act.  In the event, the arbitrator opined \nthat he had no jurisdiction in relation thereto an appeal thereagainst was \nprovided for under <a href=\"/doc/1821948/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 37</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\"> \tThe 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role of courts, for \nthe review of the arbitral award only to ensure fairness.  Intervention of the \ncourt is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by \nthe arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct \nerrors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free \nto begin the arbitration again if it is desired. So, scheme of the provision \naims at keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this \ncan be justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to \nexclude the court&#x27;s jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the \nexpediency and finality offered by it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\"> \tHowever, this Court, as would be noticed hereinafter, has the occasion \nto consider the matter in great detail in some of its decisions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"766886\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/766886/\" id=\"a_32\">Primetrade AG v.

This Court therein was dealing \nwith unequal bargaining power of the workmen and the employer and came \nto the conclusion that any term of the agreement which is patently arbitrary \nand/ or otherwise arrived at because of the unequal bargaining power would \nnot only be ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India but also hit by \n<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86594\" id=\"span_14\">In ONGC (supra), this Court, apart \nfrom the three grounds stated in <a href=\"/doc/86594/\" id=\"a_44\">Renusagar</a> (supra), added another ground \nthereto for exercise of the court&#x27;s jurisdiction in setting aside the award if it \nis patently arbitrary.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\"> \tSuch patent illegality, however, must go to the root of the matter.

Therefore, in our view, the phrase &quot;public \npolicy of India&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 34</a> in context is \nrequired to be given a wider meaning. It can be \nstated that the concept of public policy connotes \nsome matter which concerns public good and the \npublic interest. What is for public good or in public \ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to \nthe public good or public interest has varied from \ntime to time. However, the award which is, on the \nface of it, patently in violation of statutory \nprovisions cannot be said to be in public interest. \nSuch award/judgment/decision is likely to \nadversely affect the administration of justice. \nHence, in our view in addition to narrower \nmeaning given to the term &quot;public policy&quot; in \nRenusagar case10 it is required to be held that the \naward could be set aside if it is patently illegal. \nThe result would be \u0017 award could be set aside if \nit is contrary to:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">(b) the interest of India; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">(c) justice or morality, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">(d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if \nthe illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held \nthat award is against the public policy.

Such award is opposed to public policy and \nis required to be adjudged void.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\"> \tWe are not unmindful that the decision of this Court in ONGC (supra) \nhad invited considerable adverse comments but the correctness or otherwise \nof the said decision is not in question before us.

It uses \ninterim award or final award.  An award has been defined under <a href=\"/doc/595840/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 2(c)</a> \nto include an interim award.  Sub-section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/463976/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 31</a> contemplates an \ninterim award.  An interim award in terms of the said provision is not one in \nrespect of which a final award can be made, but it may be a final award on \nthe matters covered thereby, but made at an interim stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_76\"> \tThe learned arbitrator evolved the aforementioned procedure so as to \nenable the parties to address themselves as regard certain disputes at the first \ninstance.  As would appear from the partial award of the learned arbitrator, \nhe deferred some claims.  He further expressed his hope and trust that in \nrelation to some claims, the parties would arrive at some sort of settlement \nhaving regard to the fact that ONGC directly or indirectly was involved \ntherein.  While in relation to some of the claims, a finality was attached to \nthe award, certain claims were deferred so as to enable the learned arbitrator \nto advert thereto at a later stage.  If the partial award answers the definition \nof the award, as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/595840/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 2(c)</a> of the 1996 Act, for all intent \nand purport, it would be a final award.  In fact, the validity of the said award \nhad also been questioned by BSCL by filing an objection in relation thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\"> \tWe cannot also lose sight of the fact that BSCL did not raise any \nobjection before the arbitrator in relation to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator.  \nA ground to that effect has also not been taken in its application under \n<a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 34</a> of the Act.  We, however, even otherwise do not agree with the \ncontention of Mr. Mitra that a partial award is akin to a preliminary decree.  \nOn the other hand, we are of the opinion that it is final in all respects with \nregard to disputes referred to the arbitrator which are subject matter of such \naward.  We may add that some arbitrators in stead and in place of using the \nexpression &quot;interim award&quot; use the expression &quot;partial award&quot;.  By reason \nthereof the nature and character of an award is not changed.  As, for \nexample, we may notice that in arbitral proceedings conducted under the \nRules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, the \nexpression &quot;partial award&quot; is generally used by the arbitrators in place of \ninterim award.  In any view of the matter, BSCL is not in any way \nprejudiced.  We may state that both the partial award and the final award are \nsubject matter of challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 34</a> of the Act.\n</p> \t\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\"><a href=\"/doc/1393668/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 33</a> of the Act empowers the arbitral tribunal to make \ncorrection of errors in arbitral award, to give interpretation of a specific \npoint or a part of the arbitral award, and to make an additional award as to \nclaims, though presented in the arbitral proceedings, but omitted from the \narbitral award.

Change order No.2 relates to \nadditional cost incurred by McDermott due to delay in \nreceipt of equipment and material supplied by BSCL. \nBSCL&#x27;s delivery of the equipment was upto seventeen \nmonths late. During this period, McDermott continued to \nfabricate the decks installing material as it became \navailable. The delay resulted in additional costs to \nMcDermott due to change order with cost effect of \nUS$574,000.00. BSCL has failed and neglected to make \npayment of the invoice for this change order.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">4.66: Change order no.3 relates to mobilization and \ndemobilization of Derrick Barge 26 to complete BSCL \nwork in the 1986/1987 construction season. The \nSubcontract price was based on mobilization and \ndemobilization of a single barge in the 1984/1985 and \n1985/1986 construction seasons only and performance of \nthe offshore scope of work in a continuous sequence. \nDue to BSCL delays, the WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N3 \ndecks and helidecks were not completed for installation \nduring the 1985/1986 work season. Further, the WI-7 to \nWI-8 pipeline and five risers could not be installed due to \nunavailability  of material and lack of access to the EB \nand EC jackets, which were still under construction.   In \nthe 1986/1987 construction season, Mcdermott used \nDerrick Barge 27, which was already in the field, to \ninstall the WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N3  decks.   \nMcdermott also had to mobilize  Derrick Barge 26  in the \nsame construction season for installation of the WI-7  to  \nWI-8  pipeline  and associated risers.   On the \ninstructions of BSCL, Mcdermott mobilized  Derrick \nBarge 26 in February 1987. Derrick Barge 26 installed \nthe pipelines and risers and was demobilized from the \nfield on 10 March 1987.   For the \nmobilization/demobilization of Derrick Barge 26 for the \n1986/1987 construction season work, McDermott \nsubmitted a change order to BSCL with cost effect of US \n$ 1,271,820.00.   BSCL has failed and neglected to make \npayment of the invoices for this change order.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">4.67      Change Order no.7 relates to offshore installation \nor late-supplied equipment on the WI-8 , WI-9, WI-10  \nand N3 decks.   As early as February,1986,  the parties  \ncontemplated that certain BSCL-supplied equipment \nplanned  for installation  by McDermott onshore would \nhave to be installed offshore due  to the projected late \ndelivery.   The cost of installing equipment off shore is \nmuch US $ 1,140,705.00.   On 6 November 1986, \nMcDermott reviewed the list of outstanding equipment \nand revised its change order to US $ 355,000.00.   On the \ninstructions of BSCL, McDermott performed the change \norder work and installed outstanding equipment offshore.  \nBSCL has failed and neglected to make payment of the \ninvoice for this change order.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"> \tIn the Final Award also the learned arbitrator noticed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">&quot;The discussion covering earlier issues establishes that \nBSCL was guilty of delays and disruptions.  Proceeding \nfrom there, the question is whether MII  is entitled to an \namount  on account of increased overhead  and loss of \nprofit  and additional project management costs?   MII \nstates that construction law recognizes that construction \ncontractor incurs two general jobs of costs in the course \nof its operation; the operating costs that are attributable to \na particular project, and costs such as overhead that are \nexpended  for the performance of the business as a \nwhole, including t`he particular project.   Consequently, \nconstruction law recognizes that owner caused delay \nentitles the contractor to recover from the owner the \nincreased overhead and loss of profit as part  of damages.   \nReference has been made to Hudson&#x27;s building and \nEngineering Contracts.   Article 8.176-91 pp. 1074-81 \n(11th edn.), Molly J.B., &quot;A formula for Success&quot;.  Three \nformulae have been evolved for computation of a claim \nfor increased overhead and loss   of profit due to \nprolongation of the works :  the Hudson Formula; The \nEmden Formula and Eicheay Formula. Of these three, the \nEmden Formula is the one widely applied and which has \nreceived judicial support in a number of cases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\"><a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 55</a> of the Indian Contract Act\n\n \t<a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 55</a> of the Indian Contract Act reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">&quot;55.

In the event \nthe parties knowingly give a go-by to the \nstipulation as regards the time- the same may have \ntwo several effects: (a) parties name a future \nspecific date for delivery, any (b) parties may also \nagree to the abandonment of the contract- as \nregards (a) above, there must be a specific date \nwithin which delivery has o be effected and in the \nevent there is no such specific date available in the \ncourse of conduct of the parties, then and in that \nevent, the courts are not left with any other \nconclusion but a finding that the parties themselves \nby their conduct have given a go-by to the original \nterm of the contract as regards the time being the \nessence of the contract. Be it recorded that in the \nevent the contract comes within the ambit of \n<a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 55</a>, Contract Act, the remedy is also \nprovided therein\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\"> \tIt was further observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">&quot;19. Turning now on to the issue of duty to speak, \ncan it be said that silence on the part of the buyer \nin not replying to the letters dated 15-11-1989, 20-\n11-1989, 24-11-1989, 4-12-1989 and 20-12-1989 \nonly shows that the buyer was not willing to \nextend the delivery period after 15-11-1989 \u0017 the \nanswer cannot but be in the negative, more so by \nreason of the fact that fixation of a second delivery \ndate by the Appellate Bench of the High Court as \nnoticed above, cannot be termed to be in \naccordance with the law. There was, in fact, a duty \nto speak and failure to speak would forfeit all the \nrights of the buyer in terms of the agreement. \nFailure to speak would not, as a matter of fact, \njeopardise the seller&#x27;s interest neither would the \nsame authorise the buyer to cancel the contract \nwhen there have been repeated requests for acting \nin terms of the agreement between the parties by \nthe seller to that effect more so by reason of a \ndefinite anxiety expressed by the buyer as \nevidenced in the intimation dated 8-11-1989 and as \nfound by the arbitrator as also by the learned \nSingle Judge.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_101\"> \tWe, therefore, are of the opinion that in the instant case the second \npart of <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 55</a> of the Indian Contract Act would be attracted and not the \nfirst part.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">Whether time was the essence of contract\n\n \tThe question which, further, arises for consideration is as to whether \nthe Respondents having proceeded on the basis that time was of the essence \nof the contract, it was bound to issue a notice of repudiating the contract \nsubject to reservation as regards its claim of damages.  MII, however, states \nthat it had never raised a contention that the time was of the essence of the \ncontract, but the claim arises in view of the delay caused in completion of \nthe contract for a period of 34 months and consequent escalation of costs.  \nThe price payable in terms of the sub-contract did not adequately cover \nincreased costs expended by MII.  On a plain reading of the provisions of \n<a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 55</a> of the Indian Contract Act, it is evident that as the parties did not \nintend that time was to be of the essence of the contract on the expiry \nwhereof the contract became voidable at the instance of one of the parties, \nbut by reason thereof the parties shall never be deprived of damages. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\"> \tWe may notice that the BSCL had never pleaded before the Arbitrator \nthat the time was of the essence of the contract.  In Construction contracts \ngenerally time is not of the essence of the contract unless special features \nexist therefor.  No such special features, in the instant case, has been brought \nto our notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_104\"> \tThe learned arbitrator proceeded on the basis that the BSCL had \naccepted and acknowledged that no additional cost on account of delay was \noccasioned in completing the helidecks.  MII is found to have incurred \nadditional cost for offshore installation.  The learned arbitrator has also \nfound that MII had not received any payment on account of such increased \ncost.  The compensation under the said head of claim was only in addition to \nChange Order Nos. 2,3 and 7 to which we shall advert to a little later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"186692596\" id=\"span_17\">This Court in <a href=\"/doc/186692596/\" id=\"a_63\">Hind Construction v.

While dealing with \nthe claims falling within the purview of the partial award, the arbitrator \nnoticed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">&quot;23. Interruption of WI-9 to WI-S  Pipeline  laying  (US$ \n115,087.50)\nThe Statement of claim by MII mentions that an amount \nof US $ 10,671,340.00 on account of delay and \ndisruption expenses and costs are claimed.  Admittedly, \nthey had not yet been invoiced when the reference to \narbitration was made.  It is not clear what are the specific \nclaims included within that sum.   If they had not been \ninvoiced, it cannot be said that they remained unpaid, and \nthat therefore, a difference or dispute had arisen between \nthe parties when the reference to arbitration was made.&quot;\n</blockquote> \t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">It was further noticed: \t\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">&quot;Reference has been made to the claim in respect of the \nstandby of the MII transportation spread, additional \ncompensation on account of the construction of \ntemporary emergency helidecks, the extended stay of MII \npersonnel and a claim in respect of Lay Barge 26. All \nthese claims will be considered after it has been \nsatisfactorily proved that invoices in respect of each of \nthese claims were issued and had become due for \npayment before the reference to arbitration was made and \nalso meanwhile the arbitration record will have received \nthe statement of ONGC/BSCL in respect of Change \nOrder Proposals Nos. 2,3,7 and 8. Therefore, the \nconsideration of these claims is deferred.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">\tNo invoice was raised by MII for the following claims:\n</p>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">(i)\tClaim of US$ 2,300,200 for procurement of structural material on \nBSCL&#x27;s behalf.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">(ii)\tUS $28,400 for additional Barge trip.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">(iii)\tUS $54,000 for additional pipeline survey.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\"> \tThe said claims are the subject matter of the partial award.  It was \ndealt with by the learned arbitrator in the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">&quot;It was pointed out by BSCL that ONGC did not accept \nthe reconciliation attempted by MII in regard to the \npipelines. I have examined the documents pertinent to \nthis question, and I find that the variation is so marginal \nthat it can reasonably be ignored. It seems to me that to \ntake account of those variations is to attempt to make too \nfine a point. I would accept the reconciliation statement \nand proceed on that basis. BSCL contends that the claim \nmade by MII on account of the additional survey of the \nWI-8, WI-9 pipelines is not acceptable because it is \ncovered within the lump sum price mentioned in the \nSubcontract. I am not impressed by that submission \nbecause had it been so covered ONGC would not have \nundertaken to conduct the additional survey itself. It was \ntreated as some thing outside the subject matter covered \nby the lump sum price and when ONGC requested BSCL \nto conduct the additional survey, and at the behest of \nBSCL the additional survey was conducted by MII, there \nis good reason for MII to claim the payment of \nUS$54,000 for that survey.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\"> \tWhile dealing with the claims for the standby of DB 26 and \ninterruption to WI-9 to WI S pipelines laying, the arbitrator in its partial \naward held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">&quot;22. Standby Derrick Barge 26 (US$1,396,800.00)\nThe claim for payment of standby charges in respect of \nDerrick Barge 26 relates to a standby for 24 days of that \nvessel. The MII Statement of Claim mentions that MII \nhas not sent any invoice to BSCL. Therefore it cannot be \nsaid that any claim has been made by MII yet in the \nmatter. Consequently, the position is that no difference or \ndispute concerning this had arisen between the parties \nwhen the reference to arbitration was made. Therefore, so \nfar as this arbitration is concerned, the claim cannot be \nentertained. It falls outside this arbitration and cannot be \nconsidered.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">&quot;23. Interruption of WI-9 to WI-S Pipeline Laying \n(US$115,087.50)\nThe Statement of Claim by MII mentions that an amount \nof US$10,671,340.00 on account of delay and disruption \nexpenses and costs are claimed. Admittedly, they had not \nyet been invoiced when the reference to arbitration was \nmade. It is not clear what are the Specific claims included \nwithin that sum. If they had not been invoiced, it cannot \nbe said that they remained unpaid, and that therefore a \ndifference or dispute had arisen between the parties when \nthe reference to arbitration was made.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\"> \tThe said claims were, thus, rejected only on the ground that no \ninvoice had been raised and consequently no difference or dispute had arisen \nby and between the parties at the time when the reference to arbitration was \nmade.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_112\"> \tMr. Mitra contended that applying the same line of reasoning, the \nlearned arbitrator should have rejected the aforementioned claims.  \nHowever, we may notice that the said claim as regard procurement of \nstructural material related to damages.  According to MII, the said claim \nstrictly did not relate to damages under the contract.  The BSCL was \nrequired to procure the steel and as it was not in a position to do so, the MII \nhad agreed to procure steel on its behalf provided it agreed to cover the \nMII&#x27;s cost for accelerated procurement, material priced premiums, order \nfixing costs and other incidental charges.  It is not in dispute that such a \nclaim was the subject matter of correspondence which passed between the \nparties.  Receipt of such letters from MII is not denied or disputed by BSCL.  \nIt has also not been disputed that right reserved by MII to claim such \nadditional costs towards procurement of the materials on behalf of BSCL \nwas not denied or disputed.  Only pursuant to or in furtherance of the said \ncorrespondence, procurement on the said basis had been undertaken by MII \nand acceptance of BSCL in this behalf was presumed.  The learned \nArbitrator proceeded on such presumption.  According to learned arbitrator, \ndespite such knowledge, BSCL failed to make payment.  The learned \narbitrator in his award has gone into the said question in detail.  Reference \nhad been made to the evidence of Shri A.R. Taylor, who was examined on \nbehalf of MII.  The said witness was cross-examined by BSCL.  Both the \nparties had filed detailed written submissions before the learned arbitrator.  \nIt is on the basis of such evidence brought on record and submissions made \nbefore him, the learned arbitrator held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">&quot;\u0005In my opinion, BSCL must be taken to have \naccepted the proposal of MII and to have gone \nalong with MII&#x27;s action flowing from that proposal \nand to have benefited thereby.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\"> \tWith a view to consider the submission of Mr. Mitra that in terms of \nthe contract entered into by and between the parties, MII was not  entitled to \nthe said claim, it would be proper to notice the relevant clause of the contract \nwhich is in the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">&quot;5. Replacement Steel :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">BSCL shall procure suitable steel for jackets (based on \nMTO supplied by MII) on a replacement  basis for MII \npurchased steel.   BSCL shall purchase steel as plate \nsuitable  for rolling 24 in O.D.  and above  tubulars.   \nReplacement  material  shall be delivered by BSCL  to \nMII&#x27;s yard at Dubai  Emirate, United Arab Emirates or to \nSingapore  Port Authority  for transshipment by MII (at  \nBSCL&#x27;s cost) to Batam Island,  Indonesia.  MII shall \nindicate the destination when furnishing the replacement \nsteel request.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\"> \tIn terms of the aforementioned provision of the contract, BSCL was \nrequired to procure suitable steel for jackets on replacement basis in regard \nto quantum of steel purchased by MII.  If BSCL had failed to procure the \nsaid required amount of steel to replace the structural materials which MII \nhad provided from its inventory as an accommodation to BSCL, indisputably \nthe understanding between the parties was that either such materials should \nbe replaced or the cost therefor had to be paid. It has not been disputed \nbefore the arbitrator that BSCL promptly replaced the material.  It is in that \nview of the matter, the learned arbitrator in his partial award held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">&quot; 15.19 \tThe procurement was effected by MII from \nits inventory on the basis that it would be replaced by \nBSCL promptly. It was not so replaced. To effect the \nreplacement MII would be compelled to pass through the \nentire burdensome process of procuring the structural \nmaterial directly from outside sources. MII suffered loss \nand damage which it has quantified at US$ 2.3 million in \nthe light of the considerations mentioned by it earlier.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\"> \tThe arbitrator has noticed that the claim of MII arose only after it has \nbeen satisfactorily proved that the invoices in respect of each of these claims \nwere issued and had become due for payment before reference to arbitrator.  \nIt furthermore appears that paragraph 23 of the partial award and the claim \nfor compensation on the aforementioned head are not identical.  Para 23 of \nthe partial award dealt with the claim in respect of WI-9 to WI-S pipeline \nlaying.  So far as paragraph 24 of the said award is concerned, the learned \narbitrator noticed the specific invoices issued against Change Order Nos. 2, \n3 and 7 relating to delay and disruptions.  It is, therefore, in our considered \nopinion, not correct to contend that the invoice is the only base whereby and \nwhere under a claim can be made.  There is no legal warrant for the said \nproposition.  A claim can also be made through correspondence or in \nmeetings.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\"> \tA claim for overhead costs resulting in decrease in profit or additional \nmanagement costs is a claim for damages.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\"> \tAn invoice is drawn only in respect of a claim made in terms of the \ncontract.  For raising a claim based on breach of contract, no invoice is \nrequired to be drawn.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\"> \tIt is furthermore not in dispute that the claim for damages had been \nmade prior to invocation of arbitration.  Once such a claim was made prior \nto invocation, it became a dispute within the meaning of the provisions of \nthe 1996 Act.  It is not disputed that the same claim was specifically referred \nto arbitration by MII in terms of its notice dated 10th April, 1989.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\"> \tWhile claiming damages, the amount therefor was not required to be \nquantified.  Quantification of a claim is merely a matter of proof.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"421126\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"228570\" id=\"span_19\">In fact BSCL never raised any plea before the arbitrator that the said \nclaim was arbitrary or beyond its authority.  Such an objection was required \nto be raised by BSCL before the arbitrator in terms of <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 \nAct.  It may also be of some interest to note that this Court even prior to the \nenactment of a provision like <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act in <a href=\"/doc/228570/\" id=\"a_66\">Waverly Jute \nMills Co.

Woods of Colchester Ltd (1967) 1 QB 278]\n\n \tThe arbitrator quantified the claim by taking recourse to the Emden \nformula.  The learned arbitrator also referred to other formulae, but, as \nnoticed hereinbefore, opined that the Emden Formula is a widely accepted \none.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\"> \tIt is not in dispute that MII had examined one Mr. D.J. Parson to \nprove the said claim.  The said witness calculated the increased overhead \nand loss of profit on the basis of the formula laid down in a manual \npublished by the Mechanical Contractors Association of America entitled \n&#x27;Change Orders, Overtime, Productivity&#x27; commonly known as the Emden \nFormula.  The said formula is said to be widely accepted in construction \ncontracts for computing increased overhead and loss of profit.  Mr. D.J. \nParson is said to have brought out the additional project management cost at \nUS$1,109,500.  We may at this juncture notice the different formulas \napplicable in this behalf.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\"> (a)\tHudson Formula:\tIn Hudson&#x27;s Building and Engineering Contracts, \nHudson formula is stated in the following terms:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">&quot;Contract head office overhead &amp;    x\t  contract sum    x\tperiod of delay&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">Profit percentage\t\t\t\t  contract period\t\n\n\n \tIn the Hudson formula, the head office overhead percentage is taken \nfrom the contract.  Although the Hudson formula has received judicial \nsupport in many cases, it has been criticized principally because it adopts the \nhead office overhead percentage from the contract as the factor for \ncalculating the costs, and this may bear little or no relation to the actual head \noffice costs of the contractor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">(b) Emden Formula: \tIn Emden&#x27;s Building Contracts and Practice, the \nEmden formula is stated in the following terms:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">&quot;Head office overhead &amp; profit   x   Contract sum     x    period of delay&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">100\tcontract period\t\n\n \tUsing the Emden formula, the head office overhead percentage is \narrived at by dividing the total overhead cost and profit of the contractor&#x27;s \norganization as a whole by the total turnover.  This formula has the \nadvantage of using the contractors actual head office and profit percentage \nrather than those contained in the contract.  This formula has been widely \napplied and has received judicial support in a number of cases including \nNorwest Holst Construction Ltd. v. Cooperative Wholesale Society Ltd., \ndecided on 17 February, 1998, Beechwood Development Company \n(Scotland) Ltd. v. Mitchell, decided on 21 February, 2001 and Harvey \nShoplifters Ltd. v. Adi Ltd., decided on 6 March, 2003.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">(c) Eichley Formula: \tThe Eichleay formula was evolved in America \nand derives its name from a case heard by Armed Services Board of \nContract Appeals, Eichleay Corp.  It is applied in the following manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">Step 1\n      Contract Billings\t\tTotal overhead for\t    Overhead allocable \nTotal Billings for contract   x       contract period      =   to the contract\nperiod\n\nStep 2\n      Allocable overhead\t\t\t    \nTotal days of contract   \t\t\t\t=   Daily Overhead rate\n\nStep 3\n\nDaily Contract Overhead\t\tNumber of Days      Amount of Unabsorbed \nRate\t\t\t\t   x       of delay              =   overhead&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\"> \tThis formula is used where it is not possible to prove loss of \nopportunity and the claim is based on actual cost.  It can be seen from the \nformula that the total head office overheads during the contract period is first \ndetermined by comparing the value of work carried out in the contract \nperiod for the project with the value of work carried out by the contractor as \na whole for the contract period.  A share of head office overheads for the \ncontractor is allocated in the same ratio and expressed as a lump sum to the \nparticular contract.  The amount of head office overhead allocated to the \nparticular contract is then expressed as a weekly amount by dividing it by \nthe contract period.  The period of delay is then multiplied by the weekly \namount to give the total sum claimed.  The Eichleay formula is regarded by \nthe Federal Circuit Courts of America as the exclusive means for \ncompensating a contractor for overhead expenses.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\"> \tBefore us several American decisions have been referred to by Mr. \nDipankar Gupta in aid of his submission that the Emden formula has since \nbeen widely accepted by the American courts being Nicon Inc.v. United \nStates, decided on 10 June, 2003 (USCA Fed. Cir.), Gladwynne \nConstruction Company v. Balmimore, decided on 25 September, 2002 and \nCharles G. William Construction Inc. v. White, 271 F.3d 1055.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\"> \tWe do not intend to delve deep into the matter as it is an accepted \nposition that different formulas can be applied in different circumstances and \nthe question as to whether damages should be computed by taking recourse \nto one or the other formula, having regard to the facts and circumstances of a \nparticular case, would eminently fall within the domain of the Arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\"> \tIf the learned Arbitrator, therefore, applied the Emden Formula in \nassessing the amount of damages, he cannot be said to have committed an \nerror warranting interference by this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">ACTUAL LOSS : DETERMINATION OF \n\n \tA contention has been raised both before the learned Arbitrator as also \nbefore us that MII could not prove the actual loss suffered by it as is required \nunder the Indian law, viz., <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections 55</a> and <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_70\">73</a> of the Indian Contract Act as \nMr. D.J. Parson had no personal knowledge in regard to the quantum of \nactual loss suffered by the MII.  D.J. Parson indisputably at one point of time \nor the other was associated with MII.  He applied the Emden Formula while \ncalculating the amount of damages having regard to the books of account \nand other documents maintained by MII. The learned Arbitrator did insist \nthat sufferance of actual damages must be proved by bringing on record \nbooks of account and other relevant documents. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\"><a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_71\">Sections 55</a> and <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_72\">73</a> of the Indian Contract Act do not lay down the \nmode and manner as to how and in what manner the computation of \ndamages or compensation has to be made.

It is \nnot unusual for the contractors to claim loss of \nprofit arising out of diminution in turnover on \naccount of delay in the matter of completion of the \nwork.

The claim for damages raised by MII cannot be said \nto be consequential damages.  The claim relates to direct losses purported to \nhave been occasioned by the failure to perform the contractual duty on the \npart of the BSCL and to honour the time bound commitments.  Such a loss, \naccording to MII, occurred on account of increased overhead cost and \ndecreased profit and additional management costs by reason of BSCL&#x27;s \ndelays and disruptions.  It is only in that view of the matter, the Emden \nformula was taken recourse to.  Furthermore, clause 37 of the main contract \nwas a matter of an agreement by and between ONGC and BSCL.  In law, it \ncould not have been extended to the obligations assumed by BSCL towards \nMII in terms of the contract entered into by and between the said parties.  So \nfar as ONGC is concerned, it cannot be said to have any role to play in the \nevent of breach of obligation on the part of the BSCL towards its sub-\ncontractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\"> \t<a href=\"/doc/452639/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 3.1</a> of the sub-contract reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">&quot;MII shall be bound to BSCL by the terms of this Sub-\ncontract Agreement and to the extent that the provisions \nof the respective Main Contract between Buyer and \nBSCL apply to the relevant sub-contract work of MII as \ndefined in this sub-contract agreement, MII shall assume \ntowards BSCL all the obligations and responsibilities \nwhich BSCL, by such Main Contract, assumes to Buyer \nand shall have the benefit of all rights, remedies and \nredresses against BSCL which BSCL, by such Main \nContract, has against Buyer, insofar as applicable to this \nsub-contract Agreement, provided that when any \nprovisions of the respective Main Contract between \nBuyer and BSCL is inconsistent with this sub-contract \nagreement, this sub-contract agreement shall govern and \nprevail over the Main Contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\"> \tBy reason of the said provision, therefore, the Main Contract between \nONGC and BSCL would apply to the relevant sub-contract work and MII \nwas enjoined with a duty towards BSCL to fulfill its obligations and \nresponsibilities.  But, thereby, BSCL cannot absolve itself from its liability \nso far as breach of the terms and conditions of the sub-contract is concerned.  \nIn other words, by reason of <a href=\"/doc/452639/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 3.1</a>, the contract by and between ONGC \nand BSCL has not been subsumed in the sub-contract so as to absolve the \nBSCL from its own contractual liability for breach of contract or otherwise.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\"> METHOD OF MEASUREMENT\n\n \tThe main contention of BSCL in this behalf is that the learned \narbitrator acted illegally and without jurisdiction in adopting the AISC Code.  \nThe question arose in the context of the provisions in the contract that MII \nwas required to undertake to fabricate the materials which were required to \nbe supplied and, therefore, was entitled to fabrication charges from BSCL.  \nIt has not been denied or disputed before us that the parties did not agree to a \nfixed method of measurement.  They did not refer to the AISC Code in the \ncontract but only because AISC code was not referred to in the contract, the \nsame by itself may not be a ground for us to hold that the arbitrator had gone \nbeyond the terms of the contract.  Clause 23.1.1(a) and (c) of the main \ncontract reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">&quot;a)    Payment for structural material  viz. steel and steel \ntubulars,   anodes, flooding  and grouting  stems, \nrubberized  rings and rubberized items for barge \nhampare, rub-strips and boat landing  shall be  made on \nthe basis  of actual landed  cost at Contractor&#x27;s  yard.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">Landed cost would include  c.i.f. price, testing charges, if \nany plus port charges   clearing and handling charges at \nPort, transportation to Contractor&#x27;s  fabrication yard plus \nlocal taxes (like octroi ) if any, company shall pay to \nContractor an additional 7 = per cent of the landed cost \nreferred to above to cover the  cost of procurement.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">(c ) In computing the quantity of steel materials used on \neach platform for the purpose of sub-clause (a) above, an \nallowance of 4% shall be made for wastage.

The preceding fabrication rates are worked out taking \ninto consideration installation of all equipment, \nfabrication and installation of process piping, electricals  \nand instrumentation work including  pre-commissioning  \nand all yard test in addition to structural fabrication work \nin accordance with the specifications. For computing  the \ntonnage for reimbursement of fabrication, installation, \npre-commissioning and testing work at the yard by MII  \nthe tonnage of equipment and items  for top side facilities \nshall not  be included and fabrication tonnage  shall be \nsolely on the basis of as built tonnage as approval by \nbuyer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\"> \tSubmission of Mr. Mitra is that a combined reading of the \naforementioned provisions would go to show that the method of \nmeasurement was the subject matter of the contract.  We do not agree.  \nClause 23.1.1 has no application in the present case as it covers payment for \nstructural material which has no nexus with the Claim No. 4.  The claim of \nMII was for labour charges due under the sub-contract for fabricating the \nstructures.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\"> \tThe learned arbitrator, in his partial award, while dealing with the said \nclaim held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">&quot;15.7:    As regards replacement steel, BSCL would \nprocure suitable  steel for jackets (based on MTO \nsupplied by MII) on a replacement basis for MII \npurchased steel.   BSCL would purchase steel  as plate  \nsuitable for rolling 24 in OD and tubulars.   Replacement  \nmaterial would be delivered  by BSCL  to  MII&#x27;s  yard at \nDubai, UAE or to Singapore Port Authority for \ntransshipment by MII , at  BSCL&#x27;s  cost,  to Batam \nIsland,  Indonesia.   In the matter  of computing  the \nprices payable  for structural fabrication of piles, Jackets \nand decks Clause 23.1.1  of the main fabrication \ncontracts provided that the prices  would be computed as \nfollows:  The payment  for structural material, namely, \nsteel  and steel tubulars and anodes, flooding  and \ngrouting system, rubberized   rings and rubberized  items \nfor barge bumpers, rub strips and boat landing would be \nmade on the basis of actual landed  cost  at  the yard  of \nBSCL  or MII.   The landed cost would include CIF \nprice, testing charges, if any  plus  port charges, clearing  \nand handling  charges at port , transportation  to BSCL&#x27;s  \nor MII&#x27;s  fabrication yard  plus  local taxes, and ONGC \nwould pay to BSCL in additional  7 = per cent  of the \nlanded cost to cover the cost of procurement.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\"> \tWastage allowance was relevant only for the purpose of allowance \ndue to BSCL from MII in respect of scrap materials.  The learned arbitrator \nin his award had referred to evidence adduced in this behalf by Shri A.R. \nTaylor.  The provisions of the contract have no bearing on calculation of \ngross fabricated weight of the structures for determining the fabrication \ncharges due.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\"> \tThe use of AISC Code relates to the claim for fabrication charges \nbeing Claim No. 1.  The said claim was for labour charges which was not a \nclaim for cost of material and, thus, nothing to do therewith.  The scheme of \nthe contract provides that total estimated tonnage of 18,178 ST will have the \nfollowing break \u0016 ups:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">ED/EE Platforms \t\t\t\t\u0016 6078 ST\nWI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N3 platforms \u0016 12100 ST\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   18178 ST\n\n \tSince the total tonnage of 18,178 ST was only an estimated tonnage, \nthe sub-contract made provision for variation of the contract price on the \nbasis of &#x27;as fabricated&#x27; tonnage.   Further the quantities of the materials used \nwere to be jointly determined by ONGC /EIL, BSCL and MII on the basis of \nfabricated tonnage which was to be used for adjusting the sub-contract price. \nIf the &quot;as fabricated tonnage&quot; was found to be less than the estimated \ntonnage, the excess payment received by MII through monthly bills was to \nbe refunded.  If the &quot;as fabricated tonnage&quot; was found to be more than the \nestimated tonnage, MII was to be paid for the additional tonnage by applying \nthe rate of US $ 1067 per ST.  The contract was silent with respect to the \nmethod or code to be applied for determining the &quot;as fabricated tonnage&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\"> \tClause 1.1.13 defined specifications to mean Industry Standard Codes \n(ISC).  In the absence of a contractually specified method of calculation, the \nMII applied the AISC Manual of Steel Construction for calculating the as \nfabricated tonnage. AISC is an industry standard.  It has been applied by \nONGC in other contracts. Even the Arbitrator has noted that the BSCL has \nalso accepted the validity of the AISC Code. Now the BSCL cannot turn \naround and take a contrary position before this court in the proceedings \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 34</a> of the Act. Hence by adopting the AISC Code, the \nArbitrator has not acted contrary to the terms of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\">  \tThe arbitrator in his award noticed that the parties impliedly accepted \nthe validity of the AISC method of calculation for calculating the final \nfabricated weight in the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">&quot;\u0005Instances of those contracts have been provided by \nMII during the arbitration proceeding showing that the \nAISC Code has been employed for determining the final \n&quot;as fabricated tonnage&quot; of structures\u0005It seems to me \nthat inasmuch as BSCL has applied the AISC Code in the \ncase of long to long point distance measurement it cannot \nbe denied that the AISC Code is regarded as a valid basis \nfor measurement it cannot be denied that the AISC Code \nis regarded as a valid basis for measurement. There is no \nreason why it should be applied in the case of one \ncategory of fabrication and not in the case of another.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n \t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">If before the arbitrator, the said mode of calculation was accepted, we \ndo not see any reason why the BSCL should be permitted to raise the said \nquestion before us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_149\">BUOYANCY TANKS FOR ED AND EE JACKETS\n\n \t\n \tIt involves a question of fact.  It was a part of Claim No. 1 for \nfabrication.  The contention of the BSCL is that whereas Buoyancy tanks \nwhich were used in WI-8 and N3 jackets were removed by MII after \ninstallation thereof, the same had been used after refurbishment on the \nED/EE jackets and in that view of the matter, no fabrication was required to \nbe done.  The claim of MII was that it had nothing to do with the cost of \nmaterial or the nature of the fabrication work involved.  Its claim was purely \nbased on the labour cost at the rate of US $1067 per ST which was incurred \nby it towards fabrication work in the refurbishment of the Buoyancy Tanks.  \nAccording to it, the tonnage of the Buoyancy Tanks had not been taken into \naccount by ONGC on the ground that no fabrication work was done after \nremoval of the Buoyancy Tanks from N3 and WI-8 Jackets.  The learned \narbitrator, however, in his partial award found as of fact that substantial \nfabrication work had been done by MII in the refurbishment of the said \nBuoyancy Tanks in the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">&quot;12.22\u0005Accepting those instructions, MII made \nsubstantial fabrication in refurbishing, handling, rigging \nand welding the buoyancy tanks on the ED and EE \njackets. The oral evidences of RW S.K. Mukherjee shows \nthat the attachment of buoyancy tanks involves \nsubstantial fabrication activity.  There can be no doubt \nthat fabrication work had to be done and that involved a \nmeasure of labour activity. MII has demonstrated that \nthere was difference in weight between the original \nbuoyancy tanks used on the N-3 and W-8 jackets and the \nweight of those tanks when used on the ED and EE \njackets. It says that this clearly points to substantial \nfabrication activity for refurbishment of those two tanks.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\"> \tIt has further been held by the learned Arbitrator that MII had also \nbeen able to establish that there had been a difference in weight between the \noriginal Buoyancy Tanks used on N-3 and WI-8 Jackets and the weight of \nthose tanks when used in ED and EE Jackets.  In fact, the learned arbitrator \nin arriving at the said conclusion had taken into consideration the admission \nof Shri S.K. Mukherjee who was examined on behalf of BSCL itself that \nattachment of Buoyancy Tanks involved substantial fabrication activity.  \nThe dispute raised is a matter of appreciation of evidence.  The findings \narrived at by the learned arbitrator cannot, thus, be said to be perverse.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">TIE-DOWNS AND SEA-FASTENING\n\n \tThis claim relates to the question whether MII was entitled to \npayment for fabrication as the tie-downs and sea-fastening require \nsubstantial fabrication job in regard whereof there did not exist any \nprovision in the contract.  The learned arbitrator has accepted the claim of \nMII holding that offshore construction contracts, jackets and decks are \nfabricated onshore and then they are transported on barges to the offshore \nlocation for installation wherefor the lugs, braces and other sea-fastening and \ntie-down items are required to be created which the installation contractor is \nto use to weld the jackets and decks to the transportation barges, thereby \nsecuring the jackets for their journey to the offshore location.  MII had \nmerely claimed payment for fabrication of tie-downs and sea-fastening as \npart of the fabrication scope of work.  Reference has been made to clause 2 \nof the contract which is as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">&quot;2.1 (i) \t(a) Load-out, seafastening, \u0005. 60% of the \ntransportation and installation  lumpsum \nprice of jacket, piles &amp; appurtenances\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">(b) \tLoad-out, seafastening, \u0005.40% of the \ntransportation and installation lumpsum \nprice of Decks, Hook-up and resting\n\n  \tThe said provision has no application in the instant case as it merely \nprovides for stage payment on milestone basis.  In fact, the clause which \nwould be attracted in the present case is contained in clause 2.1(a)(i) is as \nunder:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">&quot;The scope of work to be executed by Contractor under \nthis Contract shall comprises\u0005\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">(i)\tJackets\n Including bergs bumbers, best landing, grouting  an \nflooding systems, launch trustees, riser clamps. Catholic \nprotection anodes, and mats and other accessories and \ncomponents indicated in the drawings  and specifications   \nincluding  lifting lugs, pulling lugs, retaining  lugs etc. \nfor lead out and refastening and upending of the jacket.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\"> \tIt specifically covers sea-fastening as part of the scope of fabrication \ncontract work.  WI-8, WI-9, WI-10 and N-3 fabrication contract also \ncontains a similar clause in Clause 2.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\"> \tThe learned arbitrator in para 12.24 of his award noticed that BSCL \nitself has acknowledged to ONGC that the tie-down materials had been \nfabricated as part of the fabrication scope and the weight could not be \ndisallowed in calculating the &#x27;as fabricated tonnage&#x27;.  It, therefore, evidently \ncannot take a stand which is contrary thereto and inconsistent therewith.  \nThus, by reason of the award, the learned arbitrator was of the opinion that \nthe sea-fastening and tie-down were part of the transportation and \ninstallation scope and BSCL did not succeed in proving that the said item \nshould be included in the scope of transportation and is not a separate item \nunder the head of fabrication.  Again, the findings of the learned arbitrator \nwere within his domain, being findings of fact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">FOREIGN EXCHANGE\n\n \tDispute in relation to the said claim would depend upon the \ninterpretation of clause 3 of <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 2</a> of the Consolidated Sub-Contract \nPrice Schedule which provides:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">&quot;While the sub-contract price for the work described in \nthe letter of intent is payable by BSCL to MII in U.S. \nDollars the Main Contract Price is payable by ONGC to \nBSCL in Indian Rupees. It has been agreed that Rupee-\nU.S. Dollar Excahnge rate shall remain fixed at Rs. \n100.00=U.S$8.575 and loss or gain due to any variation \nin the Rupee-U.S. Dollar exchange rate at the time of \nactual remittance of bills would be to MII&#x27;s account.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\"> \tThe aforesaid rate was the prevailing rate as on 9 \nAugust 1984 as mentioned in the Letter of Intent dated \n11 September 1984. Within 30 days of completion of \nMII&#x27;s scope of work under the Sub-contract, a \nreconciliation will be made of all the payments made \nfrom time to time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\"> \tIf the cumulative value of all Rupess expended to \nbuy U.S. Dollar remittance for the Sub-contract work \ndescribed in the Letter of Intent is less than the Rupee \nequivalent of the Sub-contract price as determined on the \nbasis of the aforesaid rate prevailing on 9 August 1984, \nBSCL shall remit the balance amount of Indian Rupees, \nif any, to MII in U.S. Dollars at the prevailing rate of \nexchange on the date of such U.S. Dollar remittance; and \nif after such reconciliation it is found that BSCL have \nexpended Rupees in excess of the Rupees equivalent of \nthe Sub-contract Price for the work described in the \nLetter of Intent, MII shall arrange to refund any such \nexcess in Rupees to BSCL.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_155\"> \tClause 4.0 of the contract provides that the payment will be made by \nBSCL to MII on receipt of payment by BSCL from ONGC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\"> \tIt is not in dispute that by reason of the contract entered into by and \nbetween the parties the rate was frozen at Rs. 100 = US$ 8.575.  One of the \nquestions which arise for consideration is as to whether the said provision \napplied to all the claims or not.  According to MII, having regard to the \nprovisions for milestone payments for transportation and installation, Clause \n4.0 would apply only in relation thereto.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_157\"> \tIt is contended that BSCL had not correctly understood the merit and \npurport of the said provision which has been sought to be explained.  The \nsaid provision according to MII would be as under:  \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">If the contract is followed, MII gets US$100 and \npays back US$7.43, therefore the net receipt of \nMII is US$ 92.57. However, BSCL had adjusted \nthe exchange rate at the time of payment only. The \nrate as per contract 1 US$= 11.662. Thus, the rate \non the date of payment is Rs. 13. Therefore, the net \nreceipt of MII is only US$ 89.70. In reality, the \nloss suffered by MII was much greater since in the \nfifty-four month life of the project, the value of the \nIndian rupee deteriorated drastically against the \nU.S. dollar.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\"> \tIt is not in dispute that in terms of the contract, the payments made by \nBSCL, which was to be in US dollars, was required to be reconciled at the \nend of the contract.  According to MII, if BSCL expended less than the \nrupee amount stipulated in the sub-contract in dollar payments, BSCL would \nconvert the unused rupees to dollars to remit the dollars to MII.  Whereas if \nBSCL expended more than the agreed amount of rupees, MII would refund \nthe excess amount to BSCL so as to ensure sharing of exchange loss by both \nthe parties.  According to MII, however, BSCL acted contrary to the said \nprovision insofar as instead of paying the full amount of invoice in US \ndollars it paid at the fixed exchange rate relying on, or on the basis of, the \naforementioned provisions, resulting in loss suffered by MII.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\"> \tThe learned arbitrator proceeded on the basis that loss of exchange \nprovisions had no application in respect of structural material (claim 4), bulk \nmaterial (claim 5), transportation of pipe (claim 6), reimbursables (claim 7), \nchange orders and extra work (claim 8) and delay and disruption (claim 9).  \nBSCL although has acted in breach of the contract in which variation \nprovision as regard the claims of the sub-contract, viz., scope of fabrication \nwork (Claim 1), transportation and installation of platforms (Claim 2) and \ntransportation and installation of pipelines and risers (Claim 3) while making \npayments.  It is, however, one thing to say that having regard to the nature of \nbreach on the part of BSCL, MII would be entitled to claim damages, but it \nis another thing to say that by reason thereof it would be entitled to full \npayment without deduction relating to the BSCL conversion of Indian \nrupees to US dollars.  It is not in dispute that the initial claim of MII was US \n$ 2881195.03 which was later on revised to US $ 3330790.94.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\"> \tIn terms of the agreement, payments were to be made to MII if the \npayments were certified by EIL and upon receipt of payments from ONGC \nand upon receipt of foreign exchange clearance.  For appreciating the \naforementioned disputes, it may be necessary to refer to the general terms of \npayment clause:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">&quot;1.\tFabrication\nClaims for structural fabrication work is to be billed by \nMII duly certified by EIL on monthly basis and the \npayment of the same bills shall be released after 60 days \nof receipt of the bill by BSCL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">4.\tPayments as stipulated above will be subject to the \nfollowing conditions:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">(a)\tReceipt of foreign exchange clearance by BSCL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">(b)\tPayments on milestone basis will be made by \nBSCL to MII only after payments have been received by \nBSCL from ONGC.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\"> \tThe learned arbitrator held that MII would be entitled to receive the \nentire amount as BSCL, despite receipt of payment from ONGC, did not pay \nthe amount to MII.  For the purpose of applicability of the exchange rates, \nthe same, in our opinion, is irrelevant.  The award was required to be made \nin terms of the contract whereby and whereunder the foreign exchange rate \nwas frozen as was applicable on 9th August, 1994.  The parties were bound \nby the said terms of contract.  It may be noticed that the sub-contract was \nentered into on 1st January, 1986.  The execution of the contract had started \nmuch earlier, i.e., much before the date of entering into the contract.   The \npurpose for which the Rupee \u0016 US Dollar conversion rate has been frozen as \non 9th August, 1984 must be viewed from the angle that thereby the parties \nthought that loss or gain towards the exchange rates would be on account of \nMII.  It is in the aforementioned situation that a letter of intent in the \nfollowing terms was served: \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">&quot;M/s. McDermott International Inc.,\nP.O.

The objection raised by the claimant to the said extent is accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_173\">SUBSTITUTION\n\n \tIt is not in dispute that MII had substituted heavier material, as \nmaterial conforming to ONGC specification was not available readily in the \nmarket.  The matter was referred to EIL.  Use of material was found to be \ntechnically acceptable to EIL to which ONGC agreed by a letter dated 3rd \nMay, 1985.  ONGC, however, made it clear that it would not make payment \nfor the substituted material.  BSCL immediately by a telex dated 13th May, \n1985 informed the same to MII.  ONGC also in its letter dated 6th December, \n1984 categorically stated:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">\t&quot;The subject matter highlighted in your letter \nmentioned above has been reviewed by us  and we   have  \nfound  that  payment against  increased tonnage on \naccount of material substitutions proposed by M/s. \nBSCL/MII cannot  be agreed to.   Based on above we \nreiterate our view that we will pay the material/ \nfabrication costs based on the materials shown  in  the \nAFC drawings.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\"> \tThe claim of MII is based on the failure on the part of the BSCL to \nfulfil its part of the obligation in procurement of the required material.  It is \ntrue that BSCL agreed to reimburse MII for the same.  MII&#x27;s claim is \npartially based on the facts that EIL had recommended payments therefor as \nstated in a letter to ONGC dated 10 February 1987 and 6 April 1987. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\"> \tHowever, it is also not in dispute that ONGC did not accept the said \nrecommendations and refused to take into consideration the substituted \ntonnage for payment of &#x27;as fabricated tonnage&#x27;.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\"> \tThere may be a dispute in this behalf between BSCL and ONGC.  \nHowever, admittedly, ONGC refused payment to BSCL.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_177\">  \tIn his partial award, the learned arbitrator noticed that ONGC&#x27;s \ninvolvement was imperative.  ONGC had all along maintained its stand that \nit was not ready and willing to bear the extra costs.  The correspondence \nbetween the parties was brought on record.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\"> \tClause 5 of the contract categorically states that MII was to procure \nthe material which was to be reimbursed by BSCL.  The extra amount \nincurred by MII for procuring materials having extra thickness, therefore, \nwas not payable.  To the aforementioned extent, there has been a novation of \ncontract.   MII had never asserted, despite forwarding of the contention of \nONGC, that it would not comply therewith.  It, thus, accepted in sub silentio.  \nIt, thus, must be held to have accepted that no extra amount shall be payable.  \nIt is one thing to say that some more amount might have been spent towards \nfabrication but the learned arbitrator has awarded the exact amount claimed \nby MII in the following terms:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">&quot;I am satisfied that MII is entitled to a payment of US$ \n20, 832.108 for the disallowed tonnage of 19.584 ST at \nthe contractual rate of US$ 1067 per ST.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">\tIt is in the aforementioned context that the involvement of ONGC was \nnecessary and if it is the accepted case of the parties that ONGC would not \nentertain any claim of BSCL in this behalf, a fortiori having regard to the \ntripartite agreement, the learned arbitrator could have no jurisdiction to \ndetermine the claim in favour of MII only because at one point of time \nBSCL had raised its own claim with ONGC.  In other words, any reduction \nof the claim of the BSCL by ONGC had a direct nexus with the claim of \nMII.  It was, therefore, not a case where ONGC was not involved in the \nmatter.  The exchange of letters categorically proves that MII had accepted \nthat it would not be entitled to any extra amount in that behalf.  MII by \nnecessary implication accepted the said contention.  The principle of \nacceptance sub-silentio shall also be attracted in the instant case.  MII was, \ntherefore, not entitled to raise a claim to the extent of fabrication on account \nof the increased charges for substitution of material used for WI-8, WI-9, \nWI-10 and N-3 Jackets and piles.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\"> \tTo the aforementioned extent, the claim of MII was beyond the terms \nof the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">INTEREST\n\n\n \tThe power of the arbitrator to award interest for pre-award period, \ninterest pendent lite and interest post-award period is not in dispute.  <a href=\"/doc/463976/\" id=\"a_94\">Section \n31(7)(a)</a> provides that the arbitral tribunal may award interest, at such rate as \nit deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or \nany part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose \nand the date on which award is made, i.e., pre-award period.  This, however, \nis subject to the agreement as regard the rate of interest on unpaid sum \nbetween the parties.  The question as to whether interest would be paid on \nthe whole or part of the amount or whether it should be awarded in the pre-\naward period would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.  \nThe arbitral tribunal in this behalf will have to exercise its discretion as \nregards (i) at what rate interest should be awarded; (ii) whether interest \nshould be awarded on whole or part of the award money; and (iii) whether \ninterest should be awarded for whole or any part of the pre-award period. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\"> \tThe 1996 Act provides for award of 18% interest.  The arbitrator in \nhis wisdom has granted 10% interest both for the principal amount as also \nfor the interim.  By reason of the award, interest was awarded on the \nprincipal amount.  An interest thereon was upto the date of award as also the \nfuture interest at the rate of 18% per annum.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\"> \tHowever, in some cases, this Court was resorted to exercise its \njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 142</a> in order to do complete justice between the \nparties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_184\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"260676\" id=\"span_32\">In <a href=\"/doc/260676/\" id=\"a_96\">Pure Helium India (P) Ltd.</a> (supra) this Court upheld the Arbitration \naward for payment of money with interest at the rate of 18% p.a. by the \nrespondent to appellant.
