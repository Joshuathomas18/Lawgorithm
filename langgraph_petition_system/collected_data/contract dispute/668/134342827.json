He invites\n\n      our attention to Government Resolution dated 21.01.2003  to\n\n\n\n\n\n      show   how   clause   13   again   reiterates   that   water   for   non\n\n      irrigational   purposes   should   not   be   supplied   without\n\n\n\n\n\n      agreement.  A High Power Committee has been constituted for\n\n      said purposes and, in this situation, only reservation of water\n\n      in favour of the petitioner cannot, therefore, result in fixing a\n\n      date   for   rate   determination.

Where a vested\n               right is adversely affected by an administrative order,\n               or   where   civil   consequences   ensue,   principles   of\n               natural justice apply even if the statutory provisions\n               do not make any express provision for the same, and\n               the person concerned must be afforded opportunity\n               of hearing before the order is passed.
