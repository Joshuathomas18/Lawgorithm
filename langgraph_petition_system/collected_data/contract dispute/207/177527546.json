At the outset, it may be noted that the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_4\">Gujarat Act</a> was\n\nenacted with a view to compulsorily refer all disputes arising out\n\nof “works contract” entered into by the State Government or the\n\nPublic Sector Undertakings with any other person for those\n\nworks defined as “works contract” in terms of <a href=\"/doc/119778761/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2 (k)</a> of the\n\nGujarat Act. As far as this case is concerned, it is not disputed\n\nthat the contract entered into between the appellant State and\n\nthe respondent­contractor was a “works contract”. The contract\n\norder pertaining to the parties dated 31.07.2007 contained an\n\narbitration clause, relevant portion of which reads as follows:­\n\n            “Clause : 30(1) Disputes to be referred to Tribunal : The\n            dispute relating to this contract, so far as they relate to of\n            the following matters, whether such disputes arise during\n            the progress of the work of or after the completin or\n            abandoned thereof, shall be referred to the Arbitration\n            Tribunal, Gujarat State…”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3.   It is not disputed that the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_6\">Gujarat Act</a> is applicable in the\n\npresent cases. We are mainly concerned with Clause 43.A of the\n\ncontract entered into between the parties, which reads as\n\nfollows:­\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                                 3</span>\n\n\n               “43.A      Any sum of money due and payable to the\n               Contractor (including the security deposit returnable to\n               the contractor) executing any Government work or work of\n               any District Panchayat wholly financed as grant­in­aid\n               under this contract shall be appropriate by any District\n               Panchayat/Government and shall be set off against any\n               claim of the Government/District Panchayat of Gujarat\n               state    by    the    District   Panchayat    of    Gujarat\n               State/Government for the payment of a sum of money\n               arising out or under any other contract made by the\n               contractor with the Government/District Panchayat of\n               Gujarat State for the work wholly financed as grant­in­aid\n               by Government of Gujarat State. When no such amount\n               for purpose of the recovery from the contractor against any\n               claim of the Government/District Panchayat of Gujarat\n               state is available, such a recovery shall be made from the\n               contractor as arrears of land revenue.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    In this judgment, we are only referring to the facts of Civil\n\nAppeal No.8307 of 2019 @ SLP(C) No.36095 of 2016.                             The\n\nrespondent­contractor was awarded a contract for strengthening\n\na    section    of   National     Highway       under     work     order     dated\n\n31.07.2007. According to the contractor, he completed the work\n\non 30.04.2008 and final bill was paid to the contractor. The road\n\nwas damaged and, according to the contractor, this had occurred\n\ndue to heavy rains.           The State called upon the contractor to\n\nrepair the damaged portion and, according to the contractor, this\n\nrepair was completed after the rains stopped.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The case of the contractor is that in terms of the contract,\n\nthe contractor was only liable to remove defects for a period of 3\n\nyears which period ended on 30.04.2011.                   On 10.09.2012, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                                          4</span>\n\n\ncontractor wrote a letter to the State to release the security\n\namount. This amount was accordingly released vide letter dated\n\n10.09.2012.    The State issued letter dated 11.11.2014 calling\n\nupon the contractor to pay a sum of Rs.1,09,00,092/­.                  This\n\nclaim was based on the premise that the contractor had not\n\ncarried out the road repair work in accordance with the contract.\n\nThe appellant State threatened to withhold the payments from\n\nthe security deposits and bills of other pending works.                This\n\nnotice was challenged by filing a writ petition in the High Court of\n\nGujarat on the ground that the State was not competent to\n\nwithhold the amount payable to the contractor under other\n\ncontracts or recover the amount from payments made under\n\nother    contracts   until   the   liability   of   the   contractor   was\n\ndetermined and quantified by a Court or forum of competent\n\njurisdiction. The stand of the State was that since the work of\n\nthe contractor was defective, the State had got the work done\n\nfrom another person at the risk of the contractor. In case, the\n\ncontractor has any dispute, he can approach the Court and\n\nreliance was placed on Clause 43.A of the agreement quoted\n\nabove.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                 5</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_5\">6.    The High Court relied upon the judgment of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_7\">State of Karnataka vs. Shree Rameshwara Rice Mills,\n\nThirthahalli1</a> and the consistent view of the Gujarat High Court\n\nin various judgments referred to in the impugned judgment and\n\nheld that without quantification or crystallization of the amount\n\nsought to be recovered, the employer or the contractor cannot\n\nunilaterally recover the said amounts from the ongoing contract\n\nwork of the same contractor in connection with another contract.\n\nIt was further directed that the State could not recover the\n\namounts sought to be recovered from the payments due and\n\npayable to the contractor in other contracts.        Liberty was,\n\nhowever, given to the State to seek recovery through other means\n\nas may be permissible under law.        Accordingly vide judgment\n\ndated     18.02.2016   the   petition   was   allowed   and   the\n\ncommunication dated 11.11.2014 was set aside.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    This judgment has been challenged before us.            Shri\n\nPreetesh Kapoor, learned senior counsel appearing for the State\n\nof Gujarat contends that the High Court has no jurisdiction to\n\npass such an order. He submits that, in fact, the remedy, if any,\n\nof the respondent contractor was to approach the State Tribunal\n1 (1987) 2 SCC 160\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                   6</span>\n\n\nas constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_8\">Gujarat Act</a> and the writ court could not\n\nhave granted such relief.     On the other hand, Shri. K. G.\n\nSukhwani, learned counsel appearing for the respondent submits\n\nthat the Tribunal constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_9\">Gujarat Act</a> has no\n\njurisdiction to grant such relief and he has placed reliance on an\n\norder of the State Tribunal dated 24.11.2005 wherein the\n\nTribunal held that it can only exercise jurisdiction, powers and\n\nauthority conferred on it by or under the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_10\">Gujarat Act</a> of which it\n\nis a creation. It was further held that if the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_11\">Gujarat Act</a> does not\n\nempower the Tribunal to grant injunction, and it cannot take\n\nrecourse to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_12\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908 for grant of interim\n\nrelief. It also held that an order of interim injunction, as prayed\n\nfor like in the present case, does not fall within the ambit of\n\n‘interim award’.   The Tribunal held that there is no power to\n\ngrant such injunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">8.   It appears to us that since then, in Gujarat, challenges to all\n\ncommunications/orders, whereby the State taking recourse to\n\nthe provision of the contract akin to Clause 43.A seeks to recover\n\namounts by setting it off against the claims of contractor in other\n\ncontracts, are dealt with by the High Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                                       7</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">9.

Basically, the intention of the Stage Legislature\n\nwas that all disputes relating to works contract between the State\n\nGovernment and the persons executing the works defined as\n\nworks contract would be compulsorily referred to the Arbitral\n\nTribunal constituted under <a href=\"/doc/195388414/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 3</a> of the Gujarat Act. <a href=\"/doc/127938738/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n\n8(3)</a> clearly provides that where the Tribunal admits a reference\n\nunder sub­section (2) it will make an award or an interim award\n\ngiving its reasons thereof. This Section recognizes the power of\n\nthe Tribunal to make interim awards.         However, as pointed\n\nabove, the Tribunal took a view that an interim award could not\n\nbe in the nature of an injunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">17.

It is not only in form but also in substance a\n           negative injunction. It has no positive content.

No breach of the order of interim injunction as\n           such would be involved in non­payment of such amounts\n           by the appellant to the respondent. The only thing which\n           the appellant is interdicted from doing is to make\n           recovery of its claim for damages by appropriating such\n           amounts in satisfaction of the claim.

We find it difficult to agree\nwith the observation of the Court that the impugned\norder in form and substance being the negative the\nrespondent could refuse to pay such amounts if it\nthinks it has a valid defence, and if it chooses to do\nso there would be no breach of the injunction order.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">22. It is true that the order of injunction <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_71\">in that case</a>\nwas in negative form. But if an order injuncted a\nparty from withholding the amount due to the other\nside under pending bills in other contracts, the order\nnecessarily means that the amount must be paid. If\nthe amount is withheld there will be a defiance of\nthe injunction order and that party could be hauled\nup for infringing the injunction order. It will be a\ncontradiction in terms to say that a party is\ninjuncted from withholding the amount and yet it\ncan withhold the amount as of right. In any case if\nthe injunction order is one which a party was not\nbound to comply with, the court would be loath and\nreluctant to pass such an ineffective injunction\norder. The court never passes an order for the fun of\npassing it. It is passed only for the purpose of being\ncarried out. Once this Court came to the conclusion\nthat the court has power under <a href=\"/doc/66809985/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 41 (b)</a> read\nwith Second Schedule to issue interim injunction\nbut such interim injunction can only be for the\npurpose of and in relation to arbitration proceedings\nand further that the question whether any amounts\nwere payable by the appellant to the respondent\nunder other contracts, was not the subject matter of\nthe arbitration proceedings and, therefore, the court\nobviously could not make any interim order which,\nthough ostensibly in form an order of interim\ninjunction, in substance amount to a direction to the\nappellant to pay the amounts due to the respondent\nunder other contracts, and such an order would\nclearly be not for the purpose of and in relation to\nthe arbitration proceedings; the subsequent\nobservation of the Court that the order of injunction\nbeing negative in form and substance, there was no\ndirection to the respondent to pay the amount due to\nthe appellant under pending bills of other contracts,\nis manifestly inconsistent with the proposition of law\n<a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_73\">laid down by</a> this Court in the same case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">xxx                       xxx                       xxx\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                                            17</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">               31. We are clearly of the view that an injunction\n              order restraining the respondents from withholding\n              the amount due under other pending bills to the\n              contractor virtually amounts to a direction to pay\n              the amount to the contractor­appellant. Such an\n              order was clearly beyond the purview of clause (b)\n              of <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 41</a> of the Arbitration Act. The Union of\n              India has no objection to the grant of an injunction\n              restraining it from recovering or appropriating the\n              amount lying with it in respect of other claims of the\n              contractor towards its claim for damages. But\n              certainly Clause 18 of the standard contract confers\n              ample power upon the Union of India to withhold the\n              amount and no injunction order could be passed\n              restraining the Union of India from withholding the\n              amount.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">20.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120342440\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152816036\" id=\"span_28\">In our opinion, the judgment rendered in                   <a href=\"/doc/152816036/\" id=\"a_75\">Gangotri\n\nEnterprises Limited</a> (supra) is per incuriam because it relies\n\nupon <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_76\">Raman Iron Foundry</a> (supra) which has been specifically\n\noverruled by three Judge Bench in the case of <a href=\"/doc/120342440/\" id=\"a_77\">H.M.
