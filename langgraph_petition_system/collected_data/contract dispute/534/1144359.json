The principal grievance of the petitioner is that before passing the order which has an adverse effect, the petitioner has not been put on notice and therefore, it is in violation of the principles of natural justice. To verify the factual state of affairs, learned Standing Counsel for Railways was directed to intimate this Court whether any notice was issued to the petitioner before passing the impugned order. The learned counsel fairly submits that no such notice was issued to the petitioner.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">In view of the above, I need not go further into the matter. Suffice it to say that the impugned proceedings suffer from infraction of principles of natural justice as the petitioner was not issued with any notice before passing the impugned order. Therefore, without going into the merits of the case, the writ petition is allowed and the impugned order is quashed. However, it is open for the respondent to Issue show cause notice and then pass final orders taking into consideration the explanation. If any, submitted by the petitioner pursuant to such show cause notice.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">6.2-3 The learned senior counsel also invited my attention to an order dated 8-12-1997.

It is not in dispute that as per the agreements. Contractors under the works contract were required to purchase HTS wire from the open market and use them in the work. According to the Department, petitioners had to exercise utmost economy in the purchase and the Railway administration was to reimburse the amount. In pursuance of the said contract, petitioners were purchasing HTS wire at the price which had been intimated to the Railways. It is not in dispute that Railways was reimbursing the said cost. There is however a dispute as to whether Railways had agreed to the said price as contended by the petitioners or not. Be that as It may.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">2. When the matter stood thus. Railways informed the petitioners that from 8-11-1994 HTS wire should not be purchased at the earlier stipulated price. Apart from the said direction. Railways also purported to recover from the petitioners alleged excess price which had been received by the petitioners in regard to HTS wire vide Annexure-C dated 12-7-1997 in W.P. No. 21032/97 and Annexure-C dated 11/12-12-1996 in W.P. No. 14697/97.

Upon such review and when compared with rates quoted by other Zonal Railways, it was found that the petitioners had claimed exorbitant rates for the procurement of HTS wire far and more above the then prevailing market rate.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">7.3 Learned Additional Solicitor General also submits that even though the railway, board appointed the High Power Committee, on the basis of opinion given by learned Solicitor General of India, consisting of senior railway officers to go into the irregularities in the quotations for supply of HTS wire, quoting above the normal market rate running to several crores of rupees, the High Power Committee faced certain difficulties to coordinate with Zonal Railways and therefore, appointed Zonal Level Sub-committees to enquire and to unearth the scam.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">7.4 According to learned Additional Solicitor General, the Zonal Level Sub-committee would be constituted and action would be taken on urgency basis and till such decisions are taken based on the Committee&#x27;s report, the amount recovered from the petitioners would not be refunded, as the recoveries made are fully justified as the petitioner had claimed excess amount than the then prevailing market price of HTS wire and therefore, contends that unless Zonal Level Sub-committee comes to a conclusion and submits its report as to the rates for the HTS wire, the petitioners are not entitled for the refund of the amount recovered from them.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">7.5 However, learned Additional Solicitor General is not disputing the fact that the respondent Railway administration is party to the order dated 16-10-1997 in W.P.

Clause 1600 of the Indian Railways Standard Conditions of Contract expressly deals with the purchase of raw materials and the payments the contractors are entitled to; Clause 2500 of the Indian Railways Standard Conditions of Contract prevent the corrupt practices; and Clause 2900 of the Indian Railways Standard Conditions of Contract provides an arbitration in the event of any question or dispute arising under the contract between the contractor and the Railway administration. In this sphere, the parties can claim right conferred upon them by the contract; in the absence of any statutory obligations on the part of authority in the said contract, only as provided under the contract itself, and therefore, normally, no writ can be issued under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226</a> of Constitution of India to compel the authorities to remedy a breach of such non-statutory contract.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">9.7 Issue No. 1 is answered accordingly, however, subject to the decision in Issue No. 2.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">10.1 Issue : 2 -- Whether judicial review, conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is benighted by the narrow conceptualism on the matrix of non-statutory contracts, ignoring unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory exercise of powers in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and the principles of natural justice, by the respondent Railway administration?\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_11\">10.2 In exceptional cases, as held in <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_28\">State of Karnataka v.

Even though learned Additional Solicitor General contends that due to certain difficulties High Power Committee could not hold an enquiry and consequently, Zonal Level Sub-committees were constituted, the respondent Railway administration has not disclosed what are the difficulties which necessitated the respondent Railway Board to delegate the enquiries required to be conducted by the High Power Committee to the Zonal Level Sub-committee. In the absence of any details of such difficulties, I do not find any justification on the part of the Railway Board to delegate the enquiry to the Zonal Level Subcommittee, 10 go into the Irregularities, because they are admittedly, far subordinate to the High Power Committee, constituted by the Apex body of the respondent Railway administration, namely the Railway Board. That apart, the Zonal Level Sub-committee, has to be constituted only among the officers in the Zonal Level, namely Southern Railways, who have acted on behalf of the respondents herein -- Southern Railways, as parties to the impugned agreements dated 30-3-1984 and 30-1-1983.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_14\">10.3.2 It is well settled in law, as held in <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_31\">State of Karnataka v. Rameshwara Rice Mills, Thirthahalli</a>, reported in AIR 1987 SC 1359 case that a right to adjudicate upon an issue relating to a breach of condition of the contract cannot be said to flow from or is inhered in the right conferred to assess the damages arising from a breach of conditions. The power to assess damages is a subsidiary and consequential power and not the primary power and therefore, even the respondent Southern Railways is empowered to decide upon the question of breach as well as the quantum of damage, the adjudication of arbitration by the Zonal Level Sub-committee of the Southern Railways under the breach of contract, therefore cannot be sustained under law because, a party to the agreement cannot be an arbiter in Its own cause.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_15\">10.3.3 It is also well Settled in law the interests of justice and equity require that where a party to a contract disputes the committing of any breach of conditions, the adjudication should be by an independent person or body and not by the other party to the contract as held in <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_32\">State of Karnataka v.

Union of India , a judicial review would apply to the exercise of contractual powers by the Government bodies in order to prevent arbitrariness for reviewing not the merits of the decision in support of which the application for judicial review is made but the decision making process itself, on the ground that :--\n</p>   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">i. whether a decision-making authority exceeded its powers?\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">ii.  committed an error of law,\n \n\niii. committed a breach of the rules of natural justice;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">iv. reached a decision which no reasonable Tribunal would have reached: or\n \n\nv. abused its powers, and such judicial review can be classified under irregularity, irrationality and procedural impropriety.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">10.4.3 Again, as held in Whirl Pool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks , the power to issue prerogative writs under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provision of the Constitution. The High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The High Court, however, has imposed upon itself certain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been consistently held, by the Supreme Court, not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies namely :--\n</blockquote>   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">i. where the writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights: or\n \n\nii. where there has been a violation of the principle of natural justice: or\n \n\niii. where the order or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">10.5 Admittedly, under the matrix of the case, as discussed above, even though the Apex Body of the railway administration, namely, the Railway Board, on the opinion of the learned Solicitor General of India, constituted a High Power Committee to go into, enquire and determine the irregularities said to have been committed by the petitioners, since such enquiry had been, for the reasons not explained, delegated to the Zonal Level Sub-committee, who themselves are admittedly parties to the agreements and the Zonal Level Sub-committee is subordinate to the Railway Board, who directed to hold an enquiry against the petitioners, the same, in my considered opinion, is liable to be held as arbitrary and discriminatory, attracting <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">10.6 That apart, admittedly, the alleged breach of contract, namely, that the petitioners had claimed more rate for the HTS wires than the then prevailing market price, is yet to be adjudicated and determined by the Zonal Level Sub-committee and even before that, the respondent Railway administration had covered a huge sum, namely Rs. 1,69,78,883/- from the petitioner in W.P. No. 10814 of 1999 and a sum of Rs. 1,78,09,789/- from the petitioner in W.P. No. 11805 of 1999 respectively, even without giving any reasonable opportunity to the petitioners before arriving at the quantum of excess amount said to have been paid to the petitioners. Hence, I find a gross violation of principles of natural justice not only in the impugned proceedings demanding the recovery but also in recovering a sum of Rs. 1,69,78,883/- from the petitioner in W.P. No. 10814 of 1999 and a sum of Rs. 1,78,09.7897- from the petitioner in W.P. No. 11805 of 1999 respectively.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">10.7 Concedingly, in identical matters, both the Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka High Courts quashed the impugned recovery proceedings, wherein the respondents proposed to recover the amount from the contractors who had also supplied Mono Block Concrete Sleepers, for the same reasons as in the instant case. The learned Additional Solicitor General contends that in the matters before the Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka High Courts, the recovery proceedings were quashed before the same were given effect to, but in the instant case, the petitioners have approached the Court only after the recoveries are made and therefore, the same are not similar and identical. I am unable to agree with such contention, as the same is quite Illogical and irrational.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">10.8 The respondents have, thus, exercised their powers arbitrarily, unreasonably, illogically, discriminatorily and in violation of principle of natural justice and therefore.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">I am obliged to quash the impugned proceedings.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">10.9 Therefore, in exceptional cases, the judicial review is permissible even under the matrix of non-statutory contracts.

No. 11805 of 1999 respectively, with 6% Interest thereon, from the date of withholding till the same is refunded, within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of copy of this order or a representation by or on behalf of the petitioners enclosing copy of this order, whichever is earlier, subject to the condition that the petitioners furnish a bank guarantee for the entire amount for a period of one year;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">iii. the High Power Committee constituted or to be constituted by the Apex Body of the Railway administration, namely, the Railway Board, as per the opinion of the learned Solicitor General of India, shall, after giving a fair and reasonable opportunity the petitioners, enquire and determine as to the alleged illegality said to have been committed by the petitioners, treating all the contractors who had supplied the Mono Block Concrete Sleepers under &#x27;three quotation system&#x27;, equally, after examining the relevant books as empowered under Clause 16 of the agreements dated 30-3-1984 and 30-1-1983, within the said period of one year.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">iv. the respondents shall take appropriate decision in the matter as to the quantum of payment said to have been made in excess than the then prevailing market price;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">v. the bank guarantee directed to be furnished by the petitioners shall be invoked by the respondent Railway administration only after taking such appropriate final decision in the matter and till then the petitioners are also directed to extend the bank guarantee;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">vi. the refund ordered above with interest shall be without prejudice to the rights of either party, as to the amount recoverable/refundable and the interest thereon, which shall be determined by the High Power Committee, referred to above, without any discrimination between the similarly placed contractors; and\n \n\nvii. the report of the Dy. Inspector General of Police (Anti-corruption cell-CBI), dated 15-3-2001, at any stretch of imagination, cannot be a binding guideline to the High Power Committee, but, at the best, be a matter for their consideration to arrive at a decision on the issue.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">These writ petitions are ordered accordingly. No costs.\n</blockquote> \n\n","numcites":14,"numcitedby":1,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":1144359,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"statutory contract what is","formInput":"statutory%20contract%20what%20is"},{"value":" breach of contracts","formInput":"%20breach%20of%20contracts"},{"value":"constitution of india articles","formInput":"constitution%20of%20india%20articles"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution of india","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution%20of%20india"},{"value":"principles of natural justice","formInput":"principles%20of%20natural%20justice"},{"value":"judicial review","formInput":"judicial%20review"},{"value":"non statutory contracts","formInput":"non%20statutory%20contracts"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"226 of the constitution of india","formInput":"226%20of%20the%20constitution%20of%20india"},{"value":"'Indian conditions'","formInput":"%27Indian%20conditions%27"},{"value":"escalation","formInput":"escalation"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"bank guarantee ","formInput":"bank%20guarantee%20"},{"value":"corrupt practice ","formInput":"corrupt%20practice%20"},{"value":"high power committee","formInput":"high%20power%20committee"},{"value":"financial interest","formInput":"financial%20interest"},{"value":"RDSO","formInput":"RDSO"},{"value":"\"statutory contract\"","formInput":"%22statutory%20contract%22"},{"value":"railway board","formInput":"railway%20board"},{"value":"reimbursement","formInput":"reimbursement"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"},{"value":"recovery-revenue, finance","formInput":"tag:recovery-revenue, finance"}],"courtcopy":false,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
