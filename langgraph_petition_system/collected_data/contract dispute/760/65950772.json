It has been claimed by the\n\n        petitioner-Company that prior to amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 28</a> of the\n\n        Contract Act, the clause in agreement stipulating extinguishment of\n\n        remedy has been held by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court to be void as\n\n        it operates against the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act,\n\n        which provides that any agreement, restricting absolutely from\n\n        enforcing his right under or in respect of any contract by usual legal\n\n        proceeding in the ordinary Tribunal or reducing the period of\n\n        limitation other than the limitation provided under the statute to that\n\n        extent is void, but there is no bar prohibiting the parties to enter\n\n        into an agreement relating to extinguishment of the right if it is\n Patna High Court REQ.

The\n\n        extinguishment of remedy is one thing and extinguishment of right\n\n        is another thing.\n\n\n        14.             To understand this issue, it will be relevant to quote\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, prior to its amendment:-\n\n\n                        &quot;28. Every agreement by which any party thereto\n                        is restricted absolutely from enforcing his right\n                        under or in receipt of any contract by the usual\n                        legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals or\n                        which limits the time which he may thus enforce\n                        the right is void to that extent.&quot;\n\n\n        15.             This portion of Section is prior to amendment, which\n\n        is relevant to understand the ultimate effect of amendment. Prior to\n\n        amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act can be dissected in\n\n        two parts; first part which prohibits the terms of agreement by\n\n        which party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his right\n\n        under on receipt of any contract by usual proceeding in ordinary\n\n        Tribunal. Meaning thereby, there cannot be any restriction\n\n        absolutely from enforcing his right in respect of contract by usual\n\n        legal proceeding, the Tribunal created under the ordinary law.\n\n        Second restriction has been imposed that the parties to an\n\n        agreement are not allowed to substitute their own period of\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       12/106\n\n\n\n\n        limitation in place of the period laid down in the General Law. But\n\n        the parties to an agreement are allowed to insert the clause in\n\n        agreement in the nature of prescription that is to say, they are free\n\n        to provide that if a party does not enforce his right within a\n\n        specified period, then the rights accruing under the contract shall be\n\n        forfeited or extinguished or that a party shall be discharged from all\n\n        liabilities under the Contract. In other words, a clause limiting the\n\n        time for enforcing a remedy has been prohibited, but a clause\n\n        limiting the duration upto which the rights remain alive, and\n\n        extinguishing those rights at the end of such period, is permissible.\n\n        In sense, an agreement which limits the party within which a party\n\n        to an agreement may enforce his right under any contract by a\n\n        proceeding in a Court of law is void to that extent. But the Section\n\n        does not invalidate any clause in the agreement in nature of\n\n        stipulating their own period of prescription that is to say, an\n\n        agreement which mentions that at the end of specified period, if the\n\n        rights thereunder are not enforced the right itself will cease to exist.\n\n\n        16.             This issue came for consideration before the Hon‟ble\n\n        Supreme Court and different High Courts, in which the Court has\n\n        considered the stipulation which provides the period within which\n\n        the right is not claimed, will be treated to have been forfeited /\n Patna High Court REQ.

The issue of extinguishment of right on account of the\n\n        provisions in the terms of agreement came for consideration before\n\n        the Bombay High court in the case of the New India Assurance\n\n        Co. Ltd. vs. Radheshyam Motilal Khandelwal, reported in AIR\n\n        1974 Bombay, 228. The aforesaid case is related to incorporation\n\n        of the terms of contract on insurance. There was clear condition\n\n        forfeiture of in case of fraudulent claim or failure to bring an action\n\n        within the stipulated period on repudiation of claim by the insurer.\n\n        It was held that condition mentions terms clause of policy in\n\n        question and was binding on parties. Further it was held that the\n\n        condition did not violate the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 28</a> of the\n\n        Contract Act.\n\n\n        18.

The question arose\n\n        whether the clause was valid with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_11\">section 28</a> of the\n\n        Contract Act, the claim stipulating forfeiture of right has been held\n\n        to be valid and the court held that right of claimant and liability of\n\n        the bank will remain alive only for a period of six months after the\n\n        expiry of the period of duration of the guarantee and that right of\n\n        the person in whose favour the guarantee was executed were\n\n        extinguished on expiry of that period. In other words, there is an\n\n        extinction of the right of the plaintiff under the contract and\n\n        discharge of the defendants from liability. The Court held that time\n\n        limit imposed in contractual clause keeping right and liability alive\n\n        was not hit by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, conclusion so\n\n        reached is of course is in harmony with the earlier decisions.\n\n\n        19.

A mortgage deed was executed\n\n        by him in favour of the respondent bank for that purpose. The Bank\n\n        insured the mortgage properties from time to time with the\n\n        appellant company under three insurance policies, the terms\n\n        governing the same being identical. A fire broken out in the factory\n\n        premises, caused a loss, informed the Insurance Company about the\n\n        fire, whereupon the representative of the Bank and the Insurance\n\n        Company and some surveyors visited the factory premises.\n\n        Respondent no. 1 claimed that due to fire he had suffered a loss on\n\n        account of damage to the fixed assets as well as to the stock of\n\n        goods. The amount of damage was assessed to the tune of Rs.\n\n        4,620/- The respondent No.1 wrote a letter dated 1.1.1963 as the\n\n        claim has been repudiate, under Clause-13 of the Insurance Policy,\n\n        a difference had arisen between the parties and hence respondent\n\n        no. 1 proposed to appoint a sole arbitrator to resolve the dispute and\n\n        if the company was not agreeable to the appointment of sole\n\n        arbitrator, he may be treated as a nominee of respondent no. 1. The\n\n        Insurance Company replied that as it had repudiated his claim the\n\n        arbitration clause in the policies was rendered inoperative and no\n\n        arbitration proceeding could be commenced by appointment of any\n Patna High Court REQ.

An application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 20</a> of the Arbitration Act,\n\n        1940 was filed in the Civil Court, Muzaffarnagar (Uttar Pradesh).\n\n        The appellant took an objection to the jurisdiction of the Court to\n\n        entertain the application in view of special clause in the policies\n\n        excluding the jurisdiction of courts other than the court at Delhi.\n\n        The Muzaffarnagar Civil court allowed that objection and directed\n\n        the return of the application. The Delhi High Court dismissed the\n\n        application holding that the dispute arising out of the repudiation of\n\n        the liability under clause 13 by the Insurance Company was within\n\n        the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in clause 18 and a\n\n        reference to arbitration could be made, but, as per clause 19, the\n\n        petition was barred by limitation. The matter reached to the\n\n        Hon‟ble Supreme Court. Clause 19 of the agreement with the\n\n        Insurance Company provides that &quot;in no case whatever shall the\n\n        company be liable for any loss or damage after the expiration of\n\n        twelve months from the happening of the loss or damage unless the\n\n        claim is the subject of pending action or arbitration.&quot;\n\n\n\n        20.             This cause deals with the extinguishment of the right.\n\n        The Hon‟ble Supreme Court ultimately held that such clause 19\n\n        does not violate <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_14\">section 28</a> of the Contract Act.

One of these contingencies is &quot;if the\n                          claim be made and rejected&quot; which if established\n                          gives a right of action, the period of limitation\n                          provided for the suit being filed at three months from\n                          the date of the rejection.

The Court has considered the discharge from\n\n        the liability and held that &quot;ordinary grammatical sense of\n\n        &quot;discharged from liability&quot; does not connote &quot;free from the remedy\n\n        as regards liability&quot; but are more apt to mean a total extinction of\n\n        the liability following upon an extinction of the right.&quot; The Court\n\n        further held that it is difficult to draw a reasonable distinction\n\n        between        the      words       &quot;absolved   from      liability&quot;    and\n\n        &quot;discharged from liability&quot; and think that these words &quot;discharged\n\n        from liability&quot; were intended to mean and do mean that the liability\n\n        has totally disappeared and not only that the remedy as regards the\n\n        liability has disappeared&quot;.\n\n\n        23.             It will be relevant to quote paragraph Nos. 25 and 31\n\n        of the said judgment, which read as follows:-\n\n\n                      &quot;25. On the next question whether this clause prescribes\n                      only a rule of limitation or provides for the extinction of\n                      a right to compensation, it will be observed that the\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       21/106\n\n\n\n\n                      Bombay High Court has not discussed it at all,\n                      apparently because on the facts of the case before it\n                      would have mattered little whether the provision was one\n                      of limitation or of extinction of right. The question is\n                      however of some importance in the facts of the Madras\n                      case. For if the provision is one of limitation there would\n                      be some scope for argument in the facts of that case that\n                      the period was extended by acknowledgments of liability\n                      within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 19</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_27\">Limitation Act</a>.\n                      The question we have to decide is whether in saying that\n                      the ship or the carrier will be &quot;discharged from liability\n                      &quot;, only the remedy of the shipper or the consignee was\n                      being barred or the right was also being terminated. It is\n                      useful to remember in this connection the international\n                      character of these rules, as has been already emphasized\n                      above. Rules of limitation are likely to vary from country\n                      to   country. Provisions for extension of          periods\n                      prescribed for limitation would similarly vary. We should\n                      be slow therefore to put on the word &quot; discharged from\n                      liability&quot; an interpretation which would produce results\n                      varying in different countries and thus keeping the\n                      position uncertain for both the shipper and the ship-\n                      owner. Quite apart from this consideration, however, we\n                      think that the ordinary grammatical sense of &quot;discharged\n                      from liability&quot; does not connote &quot;freed from the remedy\n                      as regards liability &quot; but are more apt to mean a total\n                      extinction of the liability following upon an extinction of\n                      the right. We find it difficult to draw any reasonable\n                      distinction between the words &quot;absolved from liability&quot;\n                      and &quot; discharged from liability &quot; and think that these\n                      words &quot; discharged from liability&quot; were intended to mean\n                      and do mean that the liability has totally disappeared\n Patna High Court REQ.

We are unable to agree with the learned\n                      Judge of the Madras High Court that these words merely\n                      mean that &quot; that even though the right may inhere in the\n                      person who is entitled to the benefits, still the liability in\n                      the opposite party is discharged by the impossibility of\n                      enforcement.&quot; The distinction between the extinction of a\n                      right and the extinction of a remedy for the enforcement\n                      of that right, though fine, is of great importance. The\n                      Legislature could not but have been conscious of this\n                      distinction when using the words &quot;discharged from all\n                      liability &quot;in an article purporting to prescribe rights and\n                      immunities of the ship-owners. The words are apt to\n                      express an intention of total extinction of the liability and\n                      should, especially in view of the international character\n                      of the legislation, be construed in that sense. It is hardly\n                      necessary to add that once the liability is extinguished\n                      under     this   clause,    there   is   no   scope   of   any\n                      acknowledgment of liability thereafter.\n\n                      31. It cannot be seriously disputed that the stipulation\n                      under consideration does directly offend against the\n                      provisions of the 8th paragraph. For it seeks at least to\n                      &quot;lessen&quot;, otherwise than provided in the rules in the\n                      Schedule the liability of the ship or carrier for loss or\n                      damage to goods or in connection with goods caused by\n                      the failure to deliver. This stipulation requiring claim for\n                      compensation being made within one month from the\n                      date of arrival of the ship is therefore null and void.&quot;\n\n\n        24.

In that case, the Sujir Ganesh Nayak &amp; Company was\n\n        carrying on business in import and export of cashew. The\n\n        respondent-company has taken insurance relating to riot and strike.\n\n        As there was a labour dispute, the strike was called by the worker,\n\n        physically obstructed the movement of goods, on that account the\n\n        respondent-Company sustained loss, which was refused by the\n\n        appellant-Insurance Company as condition No.19 of the Insurance\n\n        policy stipulates that &quot;in no case whatever shall the Company be\n\n        liable for any loss or damage after the expiration of 12 months from\n\n        the happening of loss or the damage unless the claim is the subject\n\n        of pending action or arbitration&quot;. The plea was contested in view\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act that the right to seek relief has\n\n        been shortened the time which was prescribed by the common law\n\n        and as such it would fall within the mischief of the provisions.

This cannot be\n                            construed as curtailing the normal period of\n                            limitation provided for filing of the suit.

From the case-law referred to above the legal\n                      position that emerges is that an agreement which in\n                      effect seeks to curtail the period of limitation and\n                      prescribes a shorter period than that prescribed by law\n                      would be void as offending <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 28</a> of the Contract\n                      Act. That is because such a an agreement would seek to\n                      restrict the party from enforcing his right in Court after\n                      the period prescribed under the agreement expires even\n                      though the period prescribed by law for the enforcement\n                      of his right has yet not expired. But there could be\n                      agreements which do not seek to curtail the time for\n                      enforcement of the right but which provide for the\n                      forfeiture or waiver of the right itself if no action is\n                      commenced with in the period stipulated by the\n                      agreement. Such a clause in the agreement would not\n                      fall within the mischief of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_37\">section 28</a> of the Contract\n                      Act. To put it differently, curtailment of the period of\n                      limitation is not permissible in view of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 28</a> but\n                      extinction of the right itself unless exercised within a\n                      specified time is permissible and can be enforced. If the\n                      policy of insurance provides that if a claim is made and\n                      rejected and no action is commenced within the time\n                      stated in the policy, the benefits flowing from the policy\n                      shall stand extinguished and any subsequent action\n                      would be time barred.

This, in\n                      Brief, seems to be the settled legal position. We may\n                      now apply it to the facts of this case.&quot;\n\n\n        26.

Both the courts below thus found as a fact that an\n                      agreement was entered between the appellant and the\n                      company on March 24, 1970 stipulating period of\n                      guarantee from February 15, 1970 to February 15,\n                      1971, that the default occurred on July 1, 1970, that the\n                      demand was made on June 17, 1971 and the suit was\n                      filed on January 20, 1973 but they differed as a matter\n                      of law on the effect of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act on\n                      such agreement. <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 28</a> is extracted below :\n\n                              &quot;Every agreement, by which any party thereto is\n                              restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights\n                              under or in respect of any contract, by the usual\n                              legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or\n                              which limits the time within which he may thus\n                              enforce his rights, is void to that extent.&quot;\n\n                      The section is a departure from English law as there is\n                      no such statutory bar restraining parties from entering\n                      into such agreement. In Rehmatunnisa Begum v. Price it\n                      was observed as a general principle that, &quot;no man can\n                      exclude himself from the protection of the courts&quot;. The\n                      rationale obviously is to ensure protection against fair\n                      dealing even between unequal bargaining parties. The\n                      intention and objective being clear the courts&#x27; primary\n                      responsibility is to construe and interpret it in a manner\n                      so as to advance the objective and protect the interest of\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       29/106\n\n\n\n\n                      the party who might be frustrated by too technical and\n                      expensive approach in such matters. Further it is trite\n                      saying that the courts should lean in favour of\n                      construction which keeps the remedy alive, that is if two\n                      constructions are possible then the one favouring\n                      continuance of the suit is to be preferred than the one\n                      barring the remedy. Even though the phraseology of\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 28</a> is explicit and strikes at the very root by\n                      declaring any agreement curtailing the normal statutory\n                      period of limitation to be void the courts have been\n                      influenced by the distinction drawn by English Courts in\n                      extinction of right by agreement and curtailment of\n                      limitation. For instance in Baroda Spg. and Wvg. Co.\n                      Ltd. v. Satyanarayen Marine and Fire Insurance Co.\n                      Ltd. the agreement providing, &quot;if the claim to be made\n                      and rejected, an action or suit be not commenced within\n                      three months after such rejection ... all benefits under\n                      the policy shall be forfeited&quot; was construed as\n                      extinguishing right and not the remedy. Reliance for\n                      this was placed on numerous English decisions and the\n                      Court was of opinion that, &quot;what the plaintiff was\n                      forbidden to do under the agreement was to limit the\n                      time within which he was to enforce the right but what\n                      he had actually done was to limit the time within which\n                      he was to have any rights to enforce and that appears to\n                      be very different thing&quot;. In Vulcan Insurance Co. v.\n                      Maharaj Singh this Court, incidentally, in a different\n                      context referred to the decision in Baroda Spg. and\n                      observed that a clause like the one which provided that:\n                      &quot;In no case whatever shall the company be liable for\n                      any loss or damage after the expiration of twelve\n                      months from the happening of the loss or damage unless\n Patna High Court REQ.

Similar\n                      clause was considered in Pearl Insurance Co. v. Atma\n                      Ram on which reliance was placed by the High Court.\n                      Since the Bombay decision in Baroda Spg.2 has been\n                      referred, even though incidentally in Vulcan Insurance\n                      and it has been observed that clause like the one which\n                      came up for consideration in that case was not hit\n                      by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act the distinction drawn\n                      by the Bombay High Court on strength of English\n                      decisions between agreements giving up the right to\n                      enforce and the one curtailing limitation may be\n                      assumed to be valid. The occasion to draw such\n                      distinction flows from the anxiety of the courts to\n                      interfere as less as possible in agreements unless it is\n                      unconscionable or against public policy etc. Where\n                      statutory prohibition is placed on agreements and they\n                      are declared to be void the provision has to be\n                      construed strictly and applied restrictively confining to\n                      only those situations which are squarely covered in it. It\n                      is for this reason that any agreement which was not\n                      specifically covered in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 28</a> was not held to be\n                      invalid. When this Court observed in Vulcan Insurance\n                      that clause like 19, in that, case was not violative\n                      of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 28</a> it, obviously, meant that where filing of\n                      suit within specified time agreed between parties is\n                      made dependent on any consideration precedent then\n                      such agreement would not be void. And probably,\n                      rightly, as then it is not an agreement curtailing\n                      limitation but providing for doing one or other thing\n                      and filing the suit only after condition precedent was\n                      complied.

In all\n                      these the filing of the suit within stipulated period was\n                      dependent on rejection of claim. It could be validly said\n                      that it was not violative of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 28</a> of the Contract\n                      Act as the agreement did not curtail limitation but\n                      provided for that if the suit was not filed within the\n                      stipulated period after rejection of clause the plaintiff\n                      shall lose all rights or benefits. No further is necessary\n                      to be said as it shall be explained later that it was not\n                      necessary for the High Court to enter into this aspect at\n                      all. As regards the decision in South British Fire &amp;\n                      Marine Insurance Co. of New Zealand v. Brajanath\n                      Shaha on which reliance was placed by the High Court,\n                      it itself observed that it was not very relevant as the\n                      effect of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act on such\n                      agreement was not expressly considered. Yet it placed\n                      reliance on observations to the effect &quot;it was considered\n                      in argument that in England the agreement in clause\n                      (18) would be perfectly valid; and it cannot, I think, be\n                      contended that insurance companies in India have less\n                      need than such companies in England of the protection\n                      afforded by an agreement for the acceleration of legal\n                      proceedings to be brought against them. That being so,\n                      there is no less reason to suppose that the legislature\n                      intended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 28</a> to have far-reaching effect for\n                      which the plaintiff contended&quot;. But what the High Court\n                      lost sight of was that there was no provision like Section\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       32/106\n\n\n\n\n                      28 of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_54\">Contract Act</a> in English law and, therefore,\n                      any agreement curtailing the period of limitation than\n                      that what was provided under the ordinary law was not\n                      void. The various English decisions, adverted to by the\n                      High Court, namely, Bank of England v. Vagliano\n                      Brothers, Ford v. Baron, Thimbley v. Barton, Walker v.\n                      Nevil therefore, do not appear to be appropriate for\n                      deciding either the effect of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 28</a> or for the\n                      construction of the Fidelity Insurance Guarantee\n                      clause. The High Court further placed reliance on the\n                      following passage from Porter&#x27;s Law of Insurance :\n\n                            &quot;In Porter&#x27;s Law of Insurance (6th Edn.) page 195\n                            it is stated that insurance may lawfully limit the\n                            time within which an action may be brought to a\n                            period less than that allowed by the statute of\n                            limitation and that the true ground, on which the\n                            clause limiting the time of claim rests and is\n                            maintainable is that, by the contract of the parties\n                            the right to indemnity in case of loss and the\n                            liability of the Company therefor do not became\n                            absolute, unless the remedy is sought within the\n                            time fixed by the condition in the policy.&quot;\n\n                      It is indeed doubtful if the time-limit for bringing an\n                      action can be lawfully limited and brought to a period\n                      less than that allowed by the Statute. By lawful limit the\n                      author appeared to mean by a valid and legal\n                      agreement. But no agreement could be entered against\n                      statute. The statement was made in context of English\n                      law and not <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act. The only\n                      extent to which it could be helpful could be in the sense\n                      explained in various decisions. That is if curtailment of\n Patna High Court REQ.

From the agreement it is clear that it does not\n                      contain any clause which could be said to be contrary\n                      to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act nor it imposes any\n                      restriction to file a suit within six months from the date\n                      of determination of the contract as claimed by the\n                      company and held by the High Court. What was agreed\n                      was that the appellant would not have any right under\n                      this bond after the expiry of six months from the date of\n                      the termination of the contract. This cannot be\n                      construed as curtailing the normal period of limitation\n                      provided for filing of the suit. If it is construed so it may\n                      run the risk of being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 28</a> of the\n                      Contract Act. It only puts embargo on the right of the\n                      appellant to make its claim known not later than six\n                      months from the date of termination of contract. It is in\n                      keeping with the principle which has been explained in\n                      English decisions and by our own court that the\n                      insurance companies should not be kept in dark for long\n                      and they must be apprised of their liabilities\n                      immediately both for facility and certainty. The High\n                      Court erroneously construed it as giving up the right of\n                      enforceability of its claim after six months. Since the\n                      period is provided under the agreement the appellant\n                      had to move within this period asserting its right and\n                      apprising the company of the breach or violation by the\n                      miller to enable it either to pay or to persuade the\n                      miller to pay itself. It does not directly or indirectly\n                      curtail the period of limitation nor does it anywhere\n Patna High Court REQ.

The assertion of right, therefore,\n                      was governed by the agreement and it is imperative as\n                      well that the party concerned must put the other side on\n                      notice by asserting the right within a particular time as\n                      provided in the agreement to enable the other side not\n                      only to comply with the demand but also to put on\n                      guard that in case it is not complied it may have to face\n                      proceedings in the court of law.

Since the restriction says that the\n                      Corporation shall have no rights under the bond after\n                      the expiry of six months from the date of termination of\n                      the contract, the rights of the Corporation under the\n                      contract continue to exist for six months beyond the\n                      period during which the contract could be in force\n                      unless the dues of the Corporation under the contract\n                      are paid or satisfied in the manner provided for in the\n                      clauses of the bond itself, as could be seen therefrom.\n                      Therefore, what is envisaged by the &#x27;restriction&#x27; is that\n                      the Corporation, if wants to exercise or enforce the\n                      rights given to it under the Fidelity Insurance\n                      Guarantee Bond, it could present before the Insurance\n                      Company, the claim for its loss under the contract\n                      entered into with the rice miller even up to the period of\n                      six months from the date of termination of the contract\n                      and not beyond.

In fact the period of limitation\n                      for filing a suit or instituting a legal proceeding by the\n                      Corporation for recovery of the claim made against the\n                      Insurance Company could also be regarded as\n                      commencing from the date when the Insurance\n                      Company expressly refuses to honour the claim or from\n                      a date when its conduct amounts to refusal to honour\n                      the claim, in that, such default could also give rise to\n                      the cause of action for the institution of the suit or legal\n                      proceeding by the Corporation against the Insurance\n                      Company.

In the case of Himachal Pradesh State Forest\n\n        Company Limited vs. United India Insurance company Limited,\n\n        reported in (2009) 2 S.C.C. 252, the question of extinguishment of\n\n        right in terms of the agreement between the parties came for\n\n        consideration as in that case there was a insurance with respect to\n\n        the timber, but on account of heavy rains the insured timber was\n\n        washed away and the appellant-Forest Company Limited suffered a\n\n        loss.

From the case-law referred to above the legal\n                            position that emerges is that an agreement which in\n                            effect seeks to curtail the period of limitation and\n                            prescribes a shorter period than that prescribed by\n                            law would be void as offending <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 28</a> of the\n                            Contract Act. That is because such an agreement\n                            would seek to restrict the party from enforcing his\n                            right in Court after the period prescribed under the\n                            agreement      expires      even   though   the   period\n                            prescribed by law for the enforcement of his right\n                            has yet not expired. But there could be agreements\n Patna High Court REQ.

Such a clause in the agreement would\n                            not fall within the mischief of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 28</a> of the\n                            Contract Act. To put it differently, curtailment of the\n                            period of limitation is not permissible in view\n                            of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 28</a> but extinction of the right itself unless\n                            exercised within a specified time is permissible and\n                            can be enforced. If the policy of insurance provides\n                            that if a claim is made and rejected and no action is\n                            commenced within the time stated in the policy, the\n                            benefits flowing from the policy shall stand\n                            extinguished and any subsequent action would be\n                            time-barred.

This, in\n                            brief, seems to be the settled legal position. We may\n                            now apply it to the facts of this case.\n\n                            19.

The\n                            contract in that case said that the right shall stand\n                            extinguished after six months from the termination\n                            of the contract. The clause was found valid because\n                            it did not proceed to say that to keep the right alive\n                            the suit was also required to be filed within six\n                            months. Accordingly, it was interpreted to mean\n                            that the right was required to be asserted during\n                            that period by making a claim to the Insurance\n                            Company.

Such clauses\n                            are generally found in insurance contracts for the\n                            reason that undue delay in preferring a claim may\n                            open up possibilities of false claims which may be\n                            difficult of verification with reasonable exactitude\n                            since memories may have faded by then and even\n                            ground situation may have changed. Lapse of time\n                            in such cases may prove to be quite costly to the\n                            insurer and therefore it would not be surprising that\n                            the insurer would insist that if the claim is not made\n                            within a stipulated period, the right itself would\n                            stand extinguished.

Here the claim was\n                            not subject to any action or arbitration proceedings.\n                            The clause says that if the claim is not pressed\n                            within twelve months from the happening of any\n                            loss or damage, the Insurance Company shall cease\n                            to be liable.

Even so more than twelve months thereafter\n                            on 25-10-1978 the notice of demand was issued and\n                            the suit was filed on 2-6-1980. It is precisely to\n                            avoid such delays and to discourage such belated\n                            claims that such insurance policies contain a clause\n                            like clause 19. That is for the reason that if the\n                            claims are preferred with promptitude they can be\n                            easily verified and settled but if it is the other way\n                            round, we do not think it would be possible for the\n                            insurer to verify the same since evidence may not be\n                            fully and completely available and memories may\n                            have faded. The forfeiture Clause 12 also provides\n                            that if the claim is made but rejected, an action or\n                            suit must be commenced within three months after\n                            such rejection; failing which all benefits under the\n                            policy would stand forfeited. So, looked at from any\n                            point of view, the suit appears to be filed after the\n                            right stood extinguished. That is the reason why in\n                            Vulcan Insurance case while interpreting a clause\n                            couched in similar terms this Court said: (SCC p.\n                            952, para 23)\n\n                                    &quot;23) ...

In the present case, the contractor\n                      has not made any claim within 90 days of even receipt\n                      of the amount under the final bill.

But\n\n        the Section does not invalidate an agreement in the nature of\n\n        prescription, that is to say, an agreement which provides that, at the\n\n        end of specified period, if the right thereunder is not enforced, the\n\n        right shall cease to exist. The Law Commission of India has\n\n        considered the judgment of the Bombay, Kerla and Pubjab High\n\n        Courts and the Hon‟ble Supreme Court.

In paragraph Nos. 3.7, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 the Law\n\n        Commission has taken the views in the following terms:-\n\n\n                       &quot;3.7. A revision of the law, by invalidating even\n                      prescriptive contractual clauses, is not only required on\n                      the merits (for the reasons mentioned above), but will\n                      also make the law simplier. At present, in every case, a\n                      subtle distinction has to be applied as to whether a\n                      clause merely bars a remedy or extinguishes the right.\n                      The decision hangs on a fine distinction that is not easy\n                      of application, creating uncertainty in the minds of\n                      parties for a conflict of approach in actual cases in\n                      courts. For example, it has been held that a condition in\n                      a life insurance policy that no suit shall be brought on\n                      the policy after one year from the death of the insured is\n                      void. But a condition in a fire insurance policy that the\n                      company shall not be liable for loss or damage after the\n                      expiry of twelve months from the happening of the loss\n                      or damage, unless the claim was the subject of a\n                      pending action of arbitration, does not contravene\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_73\">section 28</a>.\n\n\n                      5.1. We now come to the changes that are needed in the\n                      present law. In our opinion, the present legal position\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       46/106\n\n\n\n\n                      as to prescriptive clauses in contracts cannot be\n                      defended as a matter of justice, logic commonsense or\n                      convenience. When accepting such clauses, consumers\n                      either do not realize the possible adverse impact of such\n                      clauses,    or    are     forced   to   agree   because   big\n                      corporations are not prepared to enter into contracts,\n                      except on these onerous terms. &quot;Take it or leave it all&quot;,\n                      is their general attitude, and because of their superior\n                      bargaining power, they naturally have the upper hand.\n                      We are not, at present, dealing with the much wider\n                      field of &quot;standard from contracts&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; terms.\n                      But confining ourselves to the narrow issue under\n                      discussion, it would appear that the present legal\n                      position is open to serious objection from the common\n                      man‟s point of view. Further, such clauses introduce an\n                      element of uncertainty in transactions which are entered\n                      into daily by hundreds of persons.\n\n\n                      5.2.

Insofar as the second aspect is\n                            concerned, it cannot be lost sight of that the\n                            judgment in National Insurance Company case\n                            (supra) was delivered on 23.3.1997 and thus\n                            related to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 28</a> as it stood\n                            prior to the amendment because that was the\n                            substantive law in force at the time when the cause\n                            of action had arisen. The amendment to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 28</a>\n                            was made with effect from 8.1.1997 and it is not\n                            disputed that the cause of action in respect of the\n                            subject matter in the present suit arose after the\n                            amendment. Sub-clause (b) of the amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_94\">Section\n                            28</a> deals with the clauses which extinguish the\n                            rights of any party thereto or discharge any party\n                            from any liability begin void under the said\n                            Section. Thus the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 28</a> has been\n                            widened whereby Clause (a) deals with the\n                            position prior to the amendment alone and Clause\n                            (b)is in addition.&quot;\n\n\n        39.             Again the matter came for consideration in the case of\n\n        JSW Steel Ltd. vs. AI Ghurir Iron and Steel LLC, reported in\n\n        2015(2) Arb. L.R. 373 (Bombay) and the same issue has been dealt\n\n        with in paragraph No.17 and 25 of the said judgment, there also the\n\n        Court has taken into consideration the effect of the amendment in\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_96\">section 28</a> of the Contract Act and the Court has in paragraph\n\n        No.25 has declared that the contract to extent limiting shorter\n\n        period with respect to discharge from liability and extinguishment\n Patna High Court REQ.

It will be relevant to quote paragraph Nos. 18, 19, 20,\n\n        24 and 25 of the said judgment, which read as under:-\n\n\n                       &quot;18. The learned arbitrators have considered the\n                       parameters of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 28</a>. A reading of the section\n                       becomes material as the learned arbitrators must be\n                       seen to have passed an award in accordance with law.\n                       <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 28</a>, as it initially stood, consisted of only the\n                       first part of the aforesaid section which is now shown to\n                       be <a href=\"/doc/333029/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 28(a)</a>. That part dealt with contracts which\n                       restricted absolutely a party enforcing any right in any\n                       legal proceeding or which limited the time to enforce\n                       such right. The first part of the section dealt with such\n                       contracts which did not allow one party to at all sue. If\n                       the restriction was absolute the contract would be void.\n                       Certain contracts only conferred a time less than time\n                       which would otherwise be available under the\n                       <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_101\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> to a party to sue. Such contracts\n                       which limited the time to enforce the rights were also\n                       void to the extent of such limitation. If the contract,\n                       therefore, provided that no claim could be made (in a\n                       court of law or in any alternate forum such an\n                       arbitration) after 30 days from a given date when the\n                       law of limitation would allow 3 years within which a\n                       party can sue, the contract would be void to the extent\n                       of the provision of the period of 30 days. The remainder\n                       of the contract would, of course, be effectuated.\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       54/106\n\n\n\n\n                      19. The legislature amended the section by the addition\n                      of clause (b) to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 28</a>. This amendment was made\n                      for specific reasons. The reasons have been set out in\n                      the Statement of objects and Reasons (SOR) of the\n                      gazetted amendment. The SOR has been shown to court\n                      by Mr. Seervai upon the argument of law requiring the\n                      court to consider whether clause such as Clause 4.2(b)\n                      could be considered void under <a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 28(b)</a>. It would\n                      be material to see the SOR to understand the legal\n                      position which prevailed by the judge made law prior to\n                      the amendment and for which the legislature considered\n                      it necessary to amend the law. The SOR runs thus:-\n\n\n                              &quot;Statement of Objects and Reasons-\n\n                              1.      The Law Commission of India has\n                              recommended in its 97th Report that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 28</a> of\n                              the Indian Contract Act, 1872 may be amended\n                              so that the anomalous situation created by the\n                              existing section may be rectified. It has been held\n                              by the courts that the said <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 28</a> shall\n                              invalidate only a clause in any agreement which\n                              restricts any party thereto from enforcing his\n                              rights absolutely or which limits the time within\n                              which he may enforce his rights. The courts\n                              have, however, held that this section shall not\n                              come into operation when the contractual term\n                              spells out an extinction of the right of a party to\n                              sue or spells out the discharge of a party from all\n                              liability in respect of the claim. What is thus hit\n                              by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 28</a> is an agreement relinquishing the\n                              remedy only, i.e. where the time limit specified in\n Patna High Court REQ.

A distinction is\n                              assumed to exist between remedy and right and\n                              this distinction is the basis of the present position\n                              under which a clause barring a remedy is void,\n                              but a clause extinguishing the rights is valid.\n                              This approach may be sound in theory but, in\n                              practice it causes serious hardship and might\n                              even be abused.\n\n\n                              2. It is felt that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 28</a> of the Indian Contract\n                              Act, 1872 should be amended as it harms the\n                              interests of the consumer dealing with big\n                              corporations and causes serious hardship to\n                              those who are economically disadvantaged.\n\n                              3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.&quot;\n\n\n                      20. This would show that there was an anomalous\n                      situation created upon the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 28</a>\n                      as it then prevailed. That was under <a href=\"/doc/333029/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 28(a)</a> cited\n                      above. The SOR states that it has been held by the\n                      courts that the unamended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 28</a> would invalidate\n                      only a clause which would restrict the party from\n                      absolutely enforcing its rights or from limiting the time\n                      to sue. The SOR further states that the courts have held\n                      that this section would not come into operation when\n                      any contractual term sets out the extinction of the right\n                      to sue or discharges a party from the liability when\n                      sued. The legislature considered that, therefore, even\n                      when a remedy was relinquished, the agreement would\n                      be hit by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 28</a>. This would be on the basis of\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       56/106\n\n\n\n\n                      reasonableness       of    agreements.   However,    the\n                      legislature thought that though this would be sound in\n                      theory, it caused serious hardship to parties and could\n                      be abused specially if they were consumers dealing with\n                      large corporations. The legislature, therefore, did the\n                      act of power balancing. The law came to be amended.\n                      The amended law, therefore, caused all contracts where\n                      the remedy was relinquished as also where the right to\n                      sue was extinguished or a discharge was claimed. All\n                      the aforesaid 3 types of agreements would be void and,\n                      therefore, unenforceable under the amended law. Mr.\n                      Seervai would argue that the learned arbitrators held\n                      that consequently Clause 4.2(b) is void as falling within\n                      the mischief of <a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 28(b)</a> of the Contract Act.\n\n                      24.       In fact, it may be seen that the right of\n                      examination of the goods and the consequent right of\n                      rejection of the goods which are two statutory rights of\n                      the respondent as they buyer would be defeated because\n                      the respondent would not have reasonable opportunity\n                      of examining the goods and a reasonable time to reject\n                      the goods outside the period of 30 days specified in\n                      Clause 4.2(b) of the contract. Such an agreement would\n                      be void under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act because if\n                      permitted it would defeat the provisions contained in\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1057711/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/210742/\" id=\"a_115\">42</a> of the Sale of Goods Act.\n\n                      25. It is, therefore, clear that such a contract would be\n                      void under <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 28</a>. The arbitrators have so held.\n                      The award is, therefore, in accordance with law as seen\n                      from the statute.&quot;\n Patna High Court REQ.

The Delhi High court in the case of Chander Kant and\n\n        Co.      vs.     The       Vice       Chairman,    D.D.A.     and     Ors.\n\n        MANU/DE/2221/2009, considered the effect of amendment in\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act. In the aforesaid case, there was a\n\n        provision stipulating 90 days for raising the claim, otherwise, it will\n\n        be deemed to have been waived and absolutely barred and the\n\n        authority shall be treated to have been discharged from all the\n\n        liabilities under the Contract in respect of all claims. The Court has\n\n        held that the effect of amendment in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act\n\n        will be that any clause extinguishing the right of any party thereto,\n\n        or discharge of any party from any liability under or in respect of\n\n        any contract on the expiry of a specified period less than the period\n\n        prescribed in the limitation Act so as to restrict the time period is\n\n        void.\n\n\n        42.             It will be relevant to quote paragraph No.8 and 9 of the\n\n        said judgment, which reads as under:-\n\n                       &quot;8.   The 1997 Amendment to the Section now also\n                       prohibits clauses which seek to extinguish the rights of\n                       any party thereto, or discharge any party from any\n                       liability under or in respect of any contract on the\n                       expiry of a specified period so as to restrict any party\n                       from enforcing his rights. The amendment gave effect to\n                       the 97th report of the Law Commission of India. The\n                       effect of the amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 28</a> was considered by the\n Patna High Court REQ.

The effect of the amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_121\">Section\n                            28</a> thus made it clear that any clause extinguishing\n                            the right of a party or discharging any party from\n                            the liability in respect of any contract on expiry of\n                            specific period so as to restrict the time period\n                            would be void.\n\n\n                            53. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments,\n                            two aspects have to be noted. The first is that it is\n                            the terms of the bank guarantee which have to be\n                            given due weight and the second is the distinction\n                            which is sought to be carved out in National\n                            Insurance Company Ltd. Case between a clause\n                            curtailing the period of limitation being void\n                            under <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act and a clause\n                            which provides for forfeiture or waiver of a right if\n                            no action is commenced within the period\n                            stipulated by the agreement.

The amendment to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 28</a> was\n                            made with effect from 8.1.1997 and it is not\n                            disputed that the cause of action in respect of the\n                            subject matter in the present suit arose after the\n                            amendment. Sub-clause (b) of the amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_125\">Section\n                            28</a> deals with the clauses which extinguish the\n                            rights of any party thereto or discharge any party\n                            from any liability being void under the said\n                            section. Thus, the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 28</a> has been\n                            widened whereby clause (a) deals with the position\n                            prior to the amendment alone and clause (b) is in\n                            addition.\n\n\n                            54. In view of the amended section coming into\n                            force, the distinction sought to be carved out\n                            earlier by the legal pronouncements would not\n                            hold good.\n\n\n                            55. In my considered view it is not open for\n                            defendant no.2 to contend that if any suit or claim\n                            is not filed within one month of the expiry of the\n                            bank guarantee, the right of the plaintiff to\n                            institute    any     legal   proceedings   itself   is\n                            extinguished. Such a plea would fly in the face of\n                            the amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 28</a> as defendant no.2 cannot\n                            be discharged from the liability nor can the rights\n                            of the plaintiff be extinguished by inclusion of the\n Patna High Court REQ.

I am thus of the considered\n                            view that to the extent there is restriction on any\n                            suit or claim being filed by the plaintiff beyond a\n                            period of one month from the expiry of the bank\n                            guarantee, the said clause would not prohibit the\n                            plaintiff from instituting the suit as it would be\n                            barred by the provisions of the amended <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_128\">Section\n                            28</a> of the Contract Act.&quot;\n\n                      9. We are in respectful agreement with the view taken\n                      by the learned Judge. In our opinion, in view of the\n                      amendment, the distinction which was drawn earlier\n                      has been obliterated and the clauses providing for\n                      extinction or discharge of the rights of the parties on the\n                      expiry of the specified period are also covered by\n                      inserting Clause (b) in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act.&quot;\n\n\n        43.

In the aforesaid case, the Court has considered the effect\n\n        of amendment in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 28</a> of the Contract act and held that\n\n        &quot;however, the law as it now stands after this amendment not only\n\n        the curtailment of limitation period is impermissible, but also the\n\n        extinction of right, if sought to be brought by the agreement within\n\n        a specified period, which period is less than the period of limitation\n\n        prescribed for the suit under the contract in question is also\n Patna High Court REQ.

In the Karnataka High Court same issue came for\n\n        consideration in the case of Central Ware Housing Corporation vs.\n\n        Ravi Constructions, (AIR 2013 Kant 18), there the question was\n\n        raised with respect to referring the matter to the arbitrator. In the\n\n        aforesaid case, there was a clause which stipulates that if the\n\n        respondent-company does not invoke arbitration clause within 90\n\n        days from the date of stipulated therein, claim was deemed to have\n\n        been waived and barred as per Clause-25 of the Contract. The High\n\n        Court has also considered the effect of amendment and held that the\n\n        agreement which restricts the period of limitation within which\n\n        claims could be referred, as also agreements which extinguish the\n\n        right of a party to prefer a claim or discharges any party from any\n\n        liability under a contract on expiry of a specified period, are void to\n\n        the aforesaid extent.

Before the amendment of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 28</a> in 1997, the\n                      agreements reducing the period of limitation were\n                      distinguished from those which did not limit the time\n                      within which a party might enforce his rights, but which\n                      provided for a release or forfeiture of rights, if no suit\n                      was brought within the period stipulated in the\n                      agreement; and the latter class of agreements, being\n                      outside the scope of the section, were held to be binding\n                      between the parties. Thus, in National Insurance Co.\n                      Ltd.      v.     Sujir      Ganesh   Nayak     &amp;      Co.\n                      (MANU/SC/0491/1997 : AIR 1997 SC 2049), the\n                      Supreme Court drew a clear distinction between an\n                      agreement which curtails the period of limitation and\n                      an agreement which provides for forfeiture or waiver of\n                      the right itself, if no action is commenced within the\n                      period stipulated by the agreement. The first was held to\n                      be void as offending <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 28</a> but the later was held\n                      not falling within the mischief of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 28</a>. It was,\n                      thus, held that curtailment of the period of limitation\n                      was not permissible in view of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 28</a> but extinction\n                      of the right itself, unless exercised within the specified\n                      time, was permissible and can be enforced.\n\n                      6. After the 1997 amendment to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 28</a> of the Indian\n                      Contract Act, 1872, not only the curtailment of the\n                      period of limitation is void, but also the extinction of\n                      right, if sought to be brought by the agreement within a\n                      specific period, which period is less than the period of\n                      limitation prescribed for the suit under the Contract in\n                      question, is also rendered void. In other words, after the\n                      amendment to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 28</a> of the Indian Contract Act,\n Patna High Court REQ.

In view of the aforesaid provisions, the amendment\n\n        made in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act specifically states that the\n\n        period other than the prescribed in the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_140\">Limitation Act</a> or any other\n\n        Statutory provisions, within which the claim has to be made,\n\n        otherwise it will be treated to have been extinguished, waived and\n\n        partly relieved from all liabilities, has been declared to be void in\n\n        view of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 28 (i)(b)</a> the Contract Act.\n\n\n        47.             In the present case, an agreement has been reached\n\n        between the parties, which stipulates that if the contractor does not\n\n        make any demand for appointment of arbitrator in respect of any\n\n        claim in writing, as aforesaid, within 45 days from receiving the\n\n        intimation from the employer or his authorized representative that\n\n        final bill is ready for payment, the claim of the contractor shall be\n\n        deemed to have been waived and absolutely barred and the\n\n        employer shall be discharged or released from all the liabilities\n\n        under the Contract in respect of his claims, is declared to be void on\n\n        account of the amendment in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 28(i)(b)</a> of the Contract Act\n\n        and it should be ignored to be a part of the agreement as the period\n Patna High Court REQ.

In such circumstances, ignoring\n\n        this provision, this Court holds that parties who have a dispute have\n\n        a right to get adjudication of the said dispute through an arbitrator.\n\n        In the present case the Chankya National Law University did not\n\n        respond by appointing the arbitrator. Hence, this Court in exercise\n\n        of power under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 11(6)</a> of this <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_145\">Arbitration Act</a> has power and\n\n        jurisdiction for appointment of Arbitrator to adjudicate the dispute\n\n        involved in the present case.\n\n\n        48.             The second point has been raised by the respondents\n\n        that as the final payment has been received by the petitioner-\n\n        company without demur will be treated that all the liabilities have\n\n        been discharged and no contract between the parties subsists and it\n\n        is no longer remain an arbitral issue and does not require to appoint\n\n        an arbitrator for adjudication of the dispute.\n\n\n        49.             It will be proper to examine the facts at hand, under\n\n        what limit this Court will have to exercise its own jurisdiction to\n\n        entertain the request for appointment of arbitrator vis-à-vis the\n\n        objection raised by the respondents taking a plea that in view of\n\n        acceptance of final bill, it is no longer an arbitral dispute for\n\n        reference.\n Patna High Court REQ.

This aspect has been dealt with by the Constitution\n\n        Bench of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of S.B.P. &amp; Co.\n\n        vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. and Another, reported in (2005) 8\n\n        S.C.C. page 618, there the Hon‟ble Supreme Court has considered\n\n        the circumstances where the Court has to form an opinion before\n\n        passing the order in reference considering the situation. There have\n\n        been some cases where the appointment of an arbitrator has been\n\n        sought, after the parties had settled the dispute and the party\n\n        concerned had certified that he had no further claims against the\n\n        other contracting party. In other words, there have been occasions\n\n        when dead claims are sought to be resurrected and there have been\n\n        cases where assertions are made of the existence of arbitration\n\n        agreements when, in fact, such existence is strongly disputed by the\n\n        other side, who appears on issuance of notice. The controversies are\n\n        also raised as to whether the claim that is sought to be put forward\n\n        comes within the purview of the arbitration clause. The Chief\n\n        Justice or his designate has necessarily to apply his mind to these\n\n        aspects before coming to conclusion, one way or the other and\n\n        before proceeding to appoint an arbitrator or declining to appoint an\n\n        arbitrator. The Court has also directed that the Chief Justice or his\n\n        designate has to examine as to whether there is an arbitration\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       66/106\n\n\n\n\n        agreement, as defined in the Act and whether the person who has\n\n        made the request before him, is a party to such an agreement. It is\n\n        further held that it is necessary to indicate that he can also decide\n\n        the question whether the claim was a dead one; or a long-barred\n\n        claim that was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties\n\n        have concluded the transaction by recording satisfaction of their\n\n        mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final payment\n\n        without objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to decide\n\n        whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the purview\n\n        of the arbitration clause. It will be proper to leave that question to\n\n        be decided by Arbitral Tribunal on taking evidence, along with the\n\n        merits of the claims involved in the arbitration.\n\n\n        51.             It will be relevant to quote paragraph Nos. 36, 37, 39,\n\n        47 of the Patel Engineering Case (supra):-\n\n\n                      &quot;36. Going by the above test it is seen that at least in\n                      the matter of deciding his own jurisdiction and in the\n                      matter of deciding on the existence of an arbitration\n                      agreement, the Chief Justice when confronted with two\n                      points of view presented by the rival parties, is called\n                      upon to decide between them and the decision vitally\n                      affects the rights of the parties in that, either the claim\n                      for appointing an Arbitral Tribunal leading to an award\n                      is denied to a party or the claim to have an arbitration\n                      proceeding set in motion for entertaining a claim is\n Patna High Court REQ.

In this context, it is not\n                      possible to say that the Chief Justice is merely\n                      exercising an administrative function when called upon\n                      to appoint an arbitrator and that he need not even issue\n                      notice to opposite side before appointing an arbitrator.\n\n\n                      37. ...There have been cases where the appointment of\n                      an arbitrator has been sought, after the parties had\n                      settled the accounts and the concerned party had\n                      certified that he had no further claims against the other\n                      contracting party. In other words, there have been\n                      occasions when dead claims are sought to be\n                      resurrected. There have been cases where assertions\n                      are made of the existence of arbitration agreements\n                      when, in fact, such existence is strongly disputed by the\n                      other side who appears on issuance of notice.\n                      Controversies are also raised as to whether the claim\n                      that is sought to be put forward comes within the\n                      purview of the concerned arbitration clause at all. The\n                      Chief Justice has necessarily to apply his mind to these\n                      aspects before coming to a conclusion one way or the\n                      other and before proceeding to appoint an arbitrator or\n                      declining to appoint an arbitrator. Obviously, this is an\n                      adjudicatory process. An opportunity of hearing to both\n                      parties is a must....\n\n                      39.

It is necessary to\n                      indicate that he can also decide the question whether\n                      the claim was a dead one; or a long-barred claim that\n                      was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties\n                      have     concluded        the     transaction   by   recording\n                      satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by\n                      receiving the final payment without objection. It may\n                      not be possible at that stage, to decide whether a live\n                      claim made, is one which comes within the purview of\n                      the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to leave\n                      that question to be decided by the arbitral tribunal on\n                      taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims\n                      involved in the arbitration. The Chief Justice has to\n                      decide whether the applicant has satisfied the\n                      conditions for appointing an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_147\">Section\n                      11(6)</a> of the Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on\n                      these aspects, the Chief Justice can either proceed on\n                      the basis of affidavits and the documents produced or\n                      take such evidence or get such evidence recorded, as\n                      may be necessary.

Mr.Mehta also urged that wrong reliance had been\n                      placed by the Division Bench on the decision of this\n                      Court in the case of P.K.

According to Mr.\n                      Mehta it was out of necessity, namely, to recover its\n                      security deposit, that a no-claim certificate had been\n                      submitted by the appellant and the same ought not to be\n                      held as a bar against the appellant for raising claims in\n                      respect of its lawful duties.\n\n                      14. In support of the aforesaid submissions, Mr.Mehta\n                      referred to and relied upon the decision of this Court in\n                      Chairman       and     MD,        NTPC   Ltd.   vs.   Reshmi\n                      Constructions, wherein the aforesaid maxim had been\n                      explained and applied to a similar situation where a\n                      question had arisen for decision as to whether an\n                      arbitration clause in a contract agreement continues to\n                      survive despite the purported satisfaction thereof.

Having regard to the\n                      views expressed in the aforesaid judgment, Mr. Mehta\n                      submitted that the Division Bench of the Calcutta High\n                      Court had erred in relying solely on Clause 43(2) of the\n                      General Conditions of Contract and the no- Claim\n                      Certificate submitted by the appellant in arriving at a\n                      conclusion      that     no     further    dispute     existed   for\n                      determination in arbitration and the judgment and\n                      orders under appeal were liable to be set aside.\n\n                      18. From the submissions made on behalf of the\n                      respective     parties        and   in    particular     from    the\n                      submissions made on behalf of the appellant, it is\n                      apparent that unless a discharge certificate is given in\n                      advance, payment of bills are generally delayed.\n                      Although, Clause 43(2) has been included in the\n                      General Conditions of Contract, the same is meant to be\n                      a safeguard as against frivolous claims after final\n                      measurement. Having regard to the decision in Reshmi\n                      Constructions, it can no longer be said that such a\n                      clause in the contract would be an absolute bar to a\n                      contractor raising claims which are genuine, even after\n                      the submission of such no-claim certificate.&quot;\n\n\n        54.

Illustration was given that if a contractor makes a claim a\n\n        decade or so after completion of the work without referring to any\n\n        acknowledgement of a liability or other factors that kept the claim\n\n        alive in law, and the claim is patently long time barred, the Chief\n\n        Justice or his designate will decide the issue whether it is a dead\n\n        claim or still is a alive claim, but if the claim has been made\n\n        beyond three years of completion of work, but say within five years\n\n        i.e. from the date of completion of work, bill was drawn up and\n\n        payments were made within three years before the claim, the Court\n\n        will not enter into a disputed question, the Court will leave the\n\n        matter to the decision of the tribunal.

It will be relevant to quote paragraph Nos. 15 and 16\n\n        of the said judgment, which reads as under:-\n\n                      &quot;15. An application under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 11</a> of the Act is\n                      expected to contain pleadings about the existence of a\n                      dispute and the existence of an arbitration agreement to\n                      decide such dispute. The applicant is not expected to\n                      justify the claim or plead exhaustively in regard to\n                      limitation or produce documents to demonstrate that the\n                      claim is within time in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 11</a> of\n                      the Act. That issue should normally be left to the Arbitral\n                      Tribunal. If the Chief Justice or his designate is of the\n                      view that in addition to examining whether there is an\n                      arbitration agreement between the parties, he should\n                      consider the issue whether the claim is a dead one (long\n                      time barred) or whether there has been satisfaction of\n                      mutual rights and obligation under the contract, he\n                      should record his intention to do so and give an\n                      opportunity to the parties to place their materials on\n                      such issue. Unless parties are put on notice that such an\n                      issue will be examined, they will be under the impression\n                      that only questions of jurisdiction and existence of\n                      arbitration agreement between the parties will be\n                      considered in such proceedings.\n\n                      16. The question whether a claim is barred by res\n                      judicata, does not arise for consideration in a\n                      proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 11</a> of the Act. Such an issue\n                      will have to be examined by the arbitral tribunal. A\n                      decision on res judicata requires consideration of the\n                      pleadings as also the claims/issues/points and the award\n                      in the first round of arbitration, in juxtaposition with the\n Patna High Court REQ.

The limited scope of <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 11</a> of the Act\n                      does not permit such examination of the maintainability\n                      or tenability of a claim either on facts or in law. It is for\n                      the arbitral tribunal to examine and decide whether the\n                      claim was barred by res judicata. There can be no\n                      threshold consideration and rejection of a claim on the\n                      ground of res judicata, while considering an application\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 11</a> of the Act.&quot;\n\n\n        56.             Similar issue came for consideration in the case of\n\n        Chairman and M.D., N.T.P.C. Ltd. vs. Reshmi Constructions,\n\n        Builders and contractors, reported in (2004) 2 S.C.C. 663. In that\n\n        case, the respondent-Reshmi Constructions has entered into an\n\n        agreement with the N.T.P.C. for a project at Kayamkulam. After\n\n        completion of the work, the respondent-Reshmi Constructions\n\n        submitted the final bill, which was allegedly not accepted by the\n\n        N.T.P.C., whereafter they themselves prepared the final bill and\n\n        forwarded the same along with a printed format of &quot;No-Demand\n\n        Certificate&quot;. The said No-Demand Certificate was signed by the\n\n        respondent-Reshmi Constructions. However, on the same date the\n\n        respondent-Reshmi Construction raised objection, mentioning\n\n        therein that the alleged final bill was signed under coercion, under\n\n        undue influence and under protest only without prejudice to rights\n\n        and claims whatsoever. There was no accord and satisfaction\n Patna High Court REQ. CASE No.8 of 2014 dt.16-11-2016\n\n                                       76/106\n\n\n\n\n        between the contracting parties. Respondent-Reshmi Construcitons\n\n        invoked the arbitration Clause for reference, which was resisted on\n\n        the ground that total amount of payment has been made and the\n\n        final bill has been settled without protest and &quot;No Dues Certificate\n\n        in the standard Performa has been submitted by the Contractor. The\n\n        respondent- Reshmi Constructions filed an application under\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 20</a> of the Arbitration Act before the Subordinate Court,\n\n        which was dismissed. The same was challenged before the Kerala\n\n        High Court, which was allowed. The matter went to the Hon‟ble\n\n        Supreme Court where plea was taken that the application under\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 20</a> of the Arbitration Act was not sustainable to be taken\n\n        into consideration as the respondent-Reshmi Constructions did not\n\n        raise the plea that they have submitted the &quot;No Demand\n\n        Certificate&quot; under coercion and the High Court committed an error\n\n        in passing the impugned order. In paragraph no. 13, the Hon‟ble\n\n        Supreme Court has framed following questions, which are as\n\n        follows:-\n\n                      &quot;(i) Whether after the contract comes to an end by\n                      completion of the contract work and acceptance of the\n                      final bill in full and final satisfaction and after issuing a\n                      No- Demand Certificate by the contractor, can any\n                      party to the contract raise any dispute for reference to\n                      arbitration?\n\n                      (ii) Whether in view of letter dated 20-12-1990 sent by\n Patna High Court REQ.

Discussing the same the Hon‟ble Supreme Court held\n\n        that the issues required to be adjudicated by the Arbitrator, placing\n\n        reliance on several judgments and applied the principle that on\n\n        completion of the work, the right to get the payment normally arise\n\n        and it is also true that on settlement of the final bill, the right to get\n\n        further payment gets weakened, but claims subsists or does not\n\n        subsist, it is an arbitral issue.\n\n\n        58.             It will be relevant to quote paragraphs Nos. 17-22 and\n\n        39 of the said judgment which read as under:-\n\n                      17. In Damodar Valley Corporation vs. K.K.

While discharge of contract by performance refers\n                      to fulfillment of the contract by performance of all the\n                      obligations in terms of the original contract, discharge\n                      by `accord and satisfaction&#x27; refers to the contract being\n                      discharged by reason of performance of certain\n                      substituted obligations. The agreement by which the\n                      original obligation is discharged is the accord, and the\n                      discharge      of     the    substituted   obligation   is   the\n                      satisfaction. A contract can be discharged by the same\n                      process which created it, that is, by mutual agreement.\n                      A contract may be discharged by the parties to the\n                      original contract either by entering into a new contract\n                      in substitution of the original contract; or by\n                      acceptance of performance of modified obligations in\n                      lieu of the obligations stipulated in the contract.\n\n                      28. The classic definition of the term `accord and\n                      satisfaction&#x27; given by the Privy Council in Payana\n                      Reena     Saminathan         vs.   Pana    Lana    Palaniappa\n                      (reiterated in Kishorilal Gupta) is as under: (I.A.

It\n                            is a clear example of what used to be well known\n                            as common law pleading as `accord and\n                            satisfaction by a substituted agreement&#x27;.

The\n                            consequence is that when such an accord and\n                            satisfaction takes place the prior rights of the\n                            parties are extinguished. They have in fact been\n                            exchanged for the new rights; and the new\n                            agreement becomes a new departure, and the\n                            rights of all the parties are fully represented by it.&quot;\n                            [Emphasis supplied]&quot;\n\n\n                      29. It is thus clear that the arbitration agreement\n                      contained in a contract cannot be invoked to seek\n                      reference of any dispute to arbitration, in the following\n                      circumstances, when the contract is discharged on\n                      account of performance, or accord and satisfaction,\n                      or mutual agreement, and the same is reduced to\n                      writing (and signed by both parties or by the party\n                      seeking arbitration) :\n\n                              (a) Where the obligations under a contract are\n                              fully performed and discharge of the contract by\n                              performance is acknowledged by a full and final\n                              discharge voucher/receipt.

What requires to be noticed is that in Nav Bharat\n                      Builders and Nathani Steels, this Court on examination\n                      of facts, was satisfied that there were negotiations and\n                      voluntary settlement of all pending disputes, and the\n                      contract was discharged by accord and satisfaction. In\n                      P. K.

In those circumstances, this Court\n                      held that after such voluntary accord and satisfaction or\n                      discharge of the contract, there could be no arbitrable\n                      disputes.\n\n                      36.

The purchaser required the supplier to\n                      furnish a full and final receipt. But the supplier did not\n                      give such a receipt. Even though there was no discharge\n                      voucher, the purchaser contended that the payments\n                      made by it were in full and final settlement of the bills.\n                      This Court rejected that contention and held that the\n                      question whether there has been a settlement of all the\n                      claims arising in connection with the contract also\n                      postulates the existence of the contract which would\n                      mean that the arbitration clause operates. This Court\n                      held that the question whether there has been a full and\n                      final settlement of a claim under the contract is itself a\n                      dispute arising `upon&#x27; or `in relation to&#x27; or `in\n                      connection with&#x27; the contract; and where there is an\n                      arbitration clause in a contract, notwithstanding the\n                      plea that there was a full and final settlement between\n                      the parties, that dispute can be referred to arbitration.\n                      It was also observed that mere claim of accord and\n                      satisfaction may not put an end to the arbitration\n                      clause. It is significant that neither P.K. Ramaiah nor\n                      Nathani Steels disagreed with the decision in Damodar\n                      Valley Corporation but only distinguished it on the\n                      ground that there was no full and final discharge\n Patna High Court REQ.

In S.C.C. para 25 (p. 284), it was explained\n                      that when a contract has been fully performed, then\n                      there is a discharge of the contract by performance and\n                      the contract comes to an end and in regard to such a\n                      discharged contract, nothing remains and there cannot\n                      be any dispute and, consequently, there cannot be\n                      reference to arbitration of any dispute arising from a\n                      discharged contract. It was held that the question\n                      whether     the    contract       has   been   discharged   by\n                      performance or not is a mixed question of fact and law,\n                      and if there is a dispute in regard to that question, such\n                      question is arbitrable.\n\n                      15. The Court in Boghara Polyfab case, however, noted\n                      an exception to this proposition. The exception noticed\n                      is that where both the parties to a contract confirm in\n                      writing that the contract has been fully and finally\n                      discharged by performance of all obligations and there\n                      are no outstanding claims or disputes, courts will not\n                      refer any subsequent claim or dispute to arbitration. Yet\n                      another exception noted therein is with regard to those\n                      cases where one of the parties to the contract issues a\n                      full and final discharge voucher (or no-dues certificate,\n                      as the case may be) confirming that he has received the\n                      payment in full and final satisfaction of all claims, and\n                      he has no outstanding claim. It was observed that\n                      issuance of full and final discharge voucher or no-dues\n                      certificate of that kind amounts to discharge of the\n                      contract by acceptance or performance and the party\n                      issuing     the     discharge voucher/certificate      cannot\n                      thereafter make any fresh claim or revive any settled\n Patna High Court REQ.

In SCC para 26 (pp. 284-85), this Court in Boghara\n                      Polyfab Private Limited held that if a party which has\n                      executed the discharge agreement or discharge\n                      voucher, alleges that the execution of such document\n                      was on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence\n                      practised by the other party, and if that party\n                      establishes the same, then such discharge voucher or\n                      agreement is rendered void and cannot be acted upon\n                      and consequently, any dispute raised by such party\n                      would be arbitrable.\n\n                      17. In S.C.C. para 24 (p. 284) in Boghara Polyfab\n                      Private Limited1, this Court held that a claim for\n                      arbitration cannot be rejected merely or solely on the\n                      ground that a settlement agreement or discharge\n                      voucher has been executed by the claimant. The Court\n                      stated that such dispute will have to be decided by the\n                      Chief     Justice/his     designate   in   the   proceedings\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act or by the Arbitral\n                      Tribunal.&quot;\n\n\n        67.

Placing reliance on the judgment of Patel Engineering\n\n        Limited (supra and the National Insurance Company Limited\n\n        (supra) held that an arbitrator can be appointed only if there is an\n\n        arbitration agreement in regard to the contract in question. If there\n\n        is an arbitration agreement in regard to contract with A and no\n\n        arbitration agreement in regard to contract with B, obviously a\n\n        dispute relating to contract B cannot be referred to arbitration on\n\n        the ground that contract A has an arbitration agreement. The\n\n        Hon‟ble Supreme Court further held that the Chief Justice or his\n\n        designate is required to examine the allegations of fabrication and\n\n        forgery made by a party in regard to the contract containing the\n\n        arbitration agreement, before appointing an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_179\">Section\n\n        11</a> of the Act, the proceedings under the said section will cease to\n\n        be summary proceedings.\n\n\n        69.

The learned counsel for the first respondent next\n                      submitted that if the Chief Justice or his designate is\n                      required to examine the allegations of fabrication and\n                      forgery made by a party in regard to the contract\n                      containing the arbitration agreement, before appointing\n                      an    arbitrator     under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_183\">section    11</a> of   the   Act,   the\n                      proceedings under the said section will cease to be a\n                      summary proceedings, and become cumbersome and\n                      protracted, necessitating recording of evidence, thereby\n                      defeating the object of the Act. In our considered view\n                      this apprehension has no relevance or merit.

When serious\n                      allegations of fraud and fabrication are made, it is not\n                      possible for the Court to proceed to appoint an\n                      arbitrator without deciding the said issue which relates\n                      to the very validity of the arbitration agreement.\n                      Therefore the fact that the allegations of fraud, forgery\n                      and fabrication are likely to involve recording of\n                      evidence or involve some delay in disposal, are not\n                      grounds for refusing to consider the existence of a valid\n                      arbitration agreement.\n\n                      17. The apprehension that such contentions are likely to\n                      be raised frequently to protract the proceedings\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_185\">section 11</a> of the Act or to delay the arbitration\n                      process, thereby defeating the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_186\">section 11</a> of\n                      the Act is also without basis. Where agreements have\n                      been performed in part, such a contention will not be\n                      entertained. It is only in a very few cases, where an\n                      agreement which had not seen the light of the day is\n                      suddenly propounded, or where the agreement had\n                      never     been     acted     upon   or   where   sufficient\n                      circumstances exist to doubt the genuineness of the\n                      agreement, the Chief Justice of his designate will\n                      examine this issue. This course has repeatedly held that\n                      on the ground of termination, performance or\n                      frustration of the contract, arbitration agreement\n                      cannot be avoided. The legislature has entrusted the\n                      power of appointment of an arbitrator to the holders of\n                      high judicial offices like the Chief Justice or Judge of\n                      the Supreme Court/High Court, with a view that they\n                      can identify and effectively deal with false or vexatious\n                      claims made only to protract the proceedings or defeat\n Patna High Court REQ.

If a party is found to have falsely contended\n                      that the contract was forged/fabricated, the Chief\n                      Justice or his designate may subject such part to heavy\n                      costs so that such false claims are discouraged.
