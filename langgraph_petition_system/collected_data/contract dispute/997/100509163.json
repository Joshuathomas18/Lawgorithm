In the rejoinder, the factum of constitution of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Committee has been denied.

In view of the above factual position, it seems that\n\n\n\n\n\n    the relationship of the parties, in the present writ petition, is\n\n\n\n\n\n    governed by the contract agreement, which has been executed\n\n    between the petitioner and the respondents on 1 st August,\n\n    2021.

Board, Subathu\n             have argued their sides in respect of settling the issue.\n             The contractor has claimed 90 days rebate for the\n             period of Corona Curfew, but he did not produce any\n\n\n\n\n                                                                .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">             authentic document in support of his claim except an\n\n\n\n\n\n             written application dated 06.12.2021 addressed to\n             CEO, Cantt. Board Subathu. This application was\n             perused and discussed at length. The contractor\n\n\n\n\n\n             failed to prove his claim of compensation for 90 days\n             and other part of his application is not tenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">                       xxx            xxx               xxx\n\n\n\n\n\n             In view of the above documents the committee is of the\n             view that the contractor is entitled to get relief only\n             for 35 days as calculated above during which the\n             vehicle traffic did not ply. Therefore the committee\n             assessed the claim of rebate to the contractor Sh. Bali\n\n             Ram, on the basis of total contract of Rs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">             1,33,10,000/- which comes to Rs. 12,76,301/- +\n             recovery whichever the contractor has collected from\n             the toll barriers during 35 days.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_80\">    46.      When the petitioner has moved the application,\n\n    which was considered by the respondents and constituted the\n\n\n\n\n    Committee by associating the petitioner himself, then, it\n\n\n\n\n\n    cannot lie in the mouth of the petitioner that he is entitled to\n\n\n\n\n\n    get the matter referred to the arbitrator, as per Clause 30 of\n\n    the contract agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">    47.      At the cost of repetition, the dispute, which has been\n\n    raised by way of the applications, claiming compensation, on\n\n    account of the losses suffered by him, due to the restrictions\n\n    imposed in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, clearly falls\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 29/12/2022 20:37:26 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                       19</span>\n\n    within Clause 25 of the contract agreement and the petitioner\n\n    is unable to make out a case, which falls within the purview of\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">    Clause 30 of the contract agreement (Annexure P-2). Hence,\n\n    he is not entitled for the relief, as claimed, in the present writ\n\n\n\n\n\n    petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">    48.           The petitioner has not only attended the meeting,\n\n\n\n\n\n    dated 6th December, 2021, but he had also attended the earlier\n\n    meetings, which were held on 23rd November, 2021, as well as\n\n    on 30th November, 2021. This fact has not been disclosed by\n\n    the writ petitioner, in his writ petition.        Therefore, on this\n\n    count also, he is not entitled to claim any relief from this\n\n\n    Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">    49.           Having glance of the above discussion, no ground for\n\n\n\n\n    interference is made out, in the instant case.
