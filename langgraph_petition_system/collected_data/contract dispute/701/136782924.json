The learned Single Judge, by way of the Impugned Order,\n                 observed that it is not in dispute that although as many as four contractors\n                 have been changed by the appellant/CWC between 2001 and 05.01.2021,\n                 when M/s RR was appointed as one of the contractors, a substantial\n                 number of workmen have remained on the rolls of one contractor or the\n                 other. It was also not in dispute that the industrial dispute(s) raised by the\n                 workmen are pending adjudication before the learned CGIT. The learned\n                 Single Judge has held that the status quo was disturbed by the\n                 appellant/CWC without taking express permission of the Industrial\n                 Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1544515/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 33(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947\n                 (hereinafter referred to as the „<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_2\">ID Act</a>‟), which, according to the learned\n                 Single Judge, was attracted to the facts of the petition. The learned Single\n                 Judge has further held that though the Notification dated 17.11.2006,\n                 prohibiting the employment of contract labour at the ICD Patparganj, had\n                 been stayed by the Court in the writ petition filed by the appellant/CWC,\n                 being W.P.(C) 4114 of 2008, vide order dated 28.05.2008 (which was\n                 made absolute on 26.04.2010), the said interim order did not efface either\n                 the findings of the Central Advisory Contract Labour Board (hereinafter\n                 referred to as the „CACLB‟) or the Notification dated 17.11.2006, which\n                 was based on these findings. The learned Single Judge has held that the\n                 appellant/CWC was therefore, wrong in replacing the workmen while the\n                 above disputes were pending consideration.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Signing Date:01.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">14:44:26              LPA 172/2021   &amp; LPA 173/2021                            Page 5 of 45</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">                  Background Facts\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">                 9.

The Impugned Order further directs status\n                 quo ante, which could not have been granted at an interim stage.\n                 10.4 He further submits that the appellant/CWC has, in fact, introduced\n                 a number of SVRS Schemes and as against the regular employee strength\n                 of 8579 in the year 2000-01, the strength in the year 2021 is only 2642.\n                 The total number of Twenty Equivalent Units (in short, „TEUs‟) handled\n                 at the ICD, Patparganj, in the year 2000 was 47496, which has been\n                 reduced to 17183 in the year 2020 and has further gone down drastically\n                 thereafter.

He submits that therefore, the implementation of the interim\n                 order passed by the learned Single Judge, will lead to an irreparable\n                 injury to the appellant/CWC and M/s RR.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">                 Submissions on behalf of M/s RR\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">                 11.

It is the core\n                                            issue on which only the very locus to make a\n                                            complaint can at all be claimed.

There is an inherent\n                                            admission in such a situation that patently the\n                                            arrangement is between the complainant and the\n                                            contractor and the claim for a new and different\n                                            relationship itself is a disputed fact. To put it\n                                            differently, the complainant seeks for a\n                                            declaration that such arrangement is not a real\n                                            one but something which is a facade.

In the said case, as there was no dispute otherwise that the\n                 workmen were temporary employees of the industry, the Supreme Court\n                 held that <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 33</a> of the ID Act would be attracted where the industry\n                 wanted to effect a change of their system in getting the work done\n                 through a contractor instead of by these temporary workers. In fact, the\n                 Supreme Court went on to hold that in a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 33A</a> of\n                 the ID Act, even if the employer is found to have contravened the\n                 provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 33</a> of the ID Act, the Tribunal has to pronounce\n                 upon the merits of the dispute between the parties. The order passed in an\n                 application under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 33A</a> of the ID Act is an Award similar to one\n                 passed in a reference under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 10</a> of the ID Act. A complaint under\n                 <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 33A</a> of the ID Act takes, as it were, in the form of a reference of\n                 the industrial dispute by the appropriate authority and the same has to be\n                 disposed of in like manner by adjudicating the matter and making the\n                 award on the merits as required under the law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_86\">                 20.      Applying the above ratio to the facts of the present case, therefore,\n                 before attracting <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 33</a> of the ID Act, a finding would have to be\n                 rendered        that      the   respondents/workmen          are,    in    fact,      the\n                 employees/workmen of the appellant/CWC. Without such determination,\n                 and merely on the assertion of the respondents/workmen, <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 33</a> of\n                 the ID Act could not have been invoked by the learned Single Judge.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">Signing Date:01.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">14:44:26              LPA 172/2021   &amp; LPA 173/2021                                    Page 35 of 45</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"4000086\" id=\"span_198\">21.

From the above discussion, it is apparent that the stage for\n                 applying or invoking <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 33</a> of the ID Act has not yet arrived. The\n                 applications of the respondents/workmen, on which the Impugned\n                 Judgment has been passed, clearly required adjudication of disputed\n                 questions of fact for determining whether the claim of the\n                 respondents/workmen that they are employees of the appellant/CWC was\n                 correct or not. It could not have been so determined in a summary\n                 manner. Equally, unless such determination is made, in the facts of the\n                 present case, <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 33</a> of the ID Act could not have been invoked. The\n                 learned Single Judge has, therefore, committed an error in placing\n                 reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 33</a> of the ID Act in granting relief to the\n                 respondents/workmen in the Impugned Order.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">Digitally Signed By:SHALOO</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">BATRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">Signing Date:01.06.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">14:44:26              LPA 172/2021   &amp; LPA 173/2021                         Page 38 of 45</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">                  Other important submissions/material\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">                 29.      In our view, the learned Single Judge has also failed to take note of\n                 the submissions of the appellant/CWC that the contractor hired by CWC\n                 are not paid on the basis of workmen employed but on the basis of the\n                 tonnage handled by it, which is stated to be measured in TEUs. In this\n                 regard, the learned senior counsel for the appellant has drawn our\n                 attention to the terms and conditions of the Notice Inviting E-Tender,\n                 which resulted in the contract being awarded to M/s RR and the invoices\n                 of M/s SFPL.
