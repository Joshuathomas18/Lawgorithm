Application No.33863/2012  was filed for amendment of the original arbitration application  by striking out / deleting / omitting the paragraphs with regard to the averment relating to the alleged MOU dated 7.7.2009.  Application No.33727/2012 was filed by Mr.V.K.Tamolia, counsel for the Non-applicants No.1,2 and 4 for correction of the words counsel for both the parties submit as counsel for the Applicant submits, which was not pressed by Mr.V.K.Tamolia on 7.12.2012 and on the other Application filed by Mr.L.L.Gupta, counsel for the Non-applicants No.6 and 7, consequential order of striking out the reference of the MOU dated 7.7.2009 was passed by this Court with the further direction for filing of the amended arbitration application and the time was also granted to the counsel for the Non-applicants to file reply to the amended arbitration application.  Thereafter, amended arbitration application has been filed on 31.1.2013 to which reply / rejoinder have been filed by the respective parties, therefore, it would be appropriate to take the facts and issues raised  in the amended arbitration application. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(4)\tBriefly stated, the facts of the case, as stated in the amended arbitration application, are that the Applicant, Non-applicant No.1 M/s.Sequin Real Estate is a partnership firm, originally constituted vide partnership deed dated 8.6.2006 (Anx.1) consisting of Non-applicants No.2 to 7 and Smt.Jadav Devi as partners. On 15.3.2007, Smt.Jadav Devi retired and the aforesaid original partnership deed dated 8.6.2006 (Anx.1) was reconstituted  first time on 15.3.2007. Smt.Jadav Devi, on her retirement, was paid a sum of Rs.7.56 lacs which were remaining in her account (in lieu of capital amount) as per Clause 8 of the re-constituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and further, a sum of Rs.2,44,44,000/- for leaving of her rights and profit  as per Clause 9 of the said deed.  As per Clause 16 of the re-constituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007, the Applicant invested the capital amount of Rs.30,00,000/- in the firm, which was increased subsequently. As per Clause 21 of the  re-constituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007, all other partners, except Jadav Devi, invested Rs.1,26,000/- for the share of 2520 Sq.Yards. The Applicant has deposited Rs.30 lacs along with Suresh Kumar Golya and the Applicant had the maximum share in the profit @ 27.50% whereas other Applicants were given profit in the share of 12.00% and Suresh Kumar Golya was given the profit of 12.50%. He and Suresh Kumar were the working partners. Clause 34 of the  re-constituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 provided for the determination of money on retirement of the partner in the form of capital amount as well as profit and loss of the firm. Clause 37 of the  re-constituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 is the arbitration clause. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(5)\tAfter the retirement of the Applicant, immediately the partnership deed was further reconstituted  on 7.7.2009. Out of the amount of Rs.78,71,000/-, a sum of Rs.46,000/- has been received in cash by the Applicant and further, a cheque of Rs.12 lacs dated 7.1.2010 was received by the Applicant but the cheque has not been encashed and other two post dated cheques of Rs.12 lacs have not been received by the Applicant. Further, as per Clause 4(b), the remaining amount of Rs.41,21,000/- was to be paid after eighteen months of the execution of the reconstituted partnership deed to the retiring partner with mutual consent. The Applicant stated in the amended arbitration application that the said amount of Rs.78,71,000/- is not inclusive of profit, which has not been calculated as per the balance sheet of the firm from 15.3.2007 to 7.7.2009 as per his share @ 27.50%.  The compliance of Clause 26 has also not been made while working out the aforesaid amount which is in lieu of capital amount. The other relevant Clauses of the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009  4(?),(?),(?) 5, 6, 26 and the arbitration Clause 29 are also given just below the  opening relevant para and the relevant clauses 4, 8, 9,16, 21, 34 and 37 of the first reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 . \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(6)\tThe relevant clauses contained in the first reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 (Anx.2) and 7.7.2009 (Anx.3) are as under: \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Relevant Clauses 4,8,9,16, 21, 34 and 37 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007\nRelevant portion of the opening para \n\t&quot;.....??

The Applicant learnt that most of the profit amount has  been concealed  by not disclosing the same in the account books which has resulted in the surrender of the aforesaid amount to the Income Tax Department. The fact of concealment of income by not disclosing the same in the balance sheet of the firm for the period 15.3.2007 to 7.7.2009 resulted in misleading the Applicant in order to take undue advantage of non payment of profit to the Applicant by  the Firm  and other partners with regard to the non-payment of profit and loss after working out the same from the balance sheet came to his notice in the month of November, 2009,  therefore, the Applicant is entitled to get appointment of an Arbitrator for production of accounts of the firm and their scrutiny as well as his entitlement in the share of the profit as per the first reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(8)\tA dispute arose between the Applicant and other partners of the reconstituted partnership firm when they did not honour the terms of the first and last reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and 7.7.2009 and did not pay to the Applicant the amount of Rs.78,71,000/-, except Rs.46,000/- in cash which was in lieu of capital and further no amount was paid to the Applicant in lieu of profit of the firm as per Clause 34 of the earlier reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 which came to his notice in the month of November, 2009, as stated above. The Applicant sent a legal notice on 13.4.2010 (Anx.4) for invoking the arbitration clause of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and 7.7.2009 as the settlement has not been arrived at between the parties. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(9)\tFurther case, as stated in the amended arbitration application, is that the Non-applicants have withheld Annexure A-1, as referred in Clause 2 of the amended arbitration application with regard to the balance sheet of the firm from 15.3.2007 to 7.7.2009 which has been said to be part of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 at the time of filing the said reconstituted partnership deed  before the Registrar of Firms and the same has also not been made available to the Applicant. It is further stated in the arbitration application that the earlier retiring partner Smt.Jadav Devi was paid a sum of Rs.7,56,000/- towards the capital amount taking into account the value of the land as Rs.7,42,000/- therefore, it cannot be said that a sum of Rs.2,42,44,000/- was paid as profit since she gave her land to the firm, although subsequent facts of income tax raid and assessment of the income tax wherein surrender of Rs.5-6 Crores by the firm and the Applicant and reply of the Non-applicants that the assessment has been made on 12.3.2013 with regard to the assessment year 2009-2010 and assessment period 2010-2011 on the basis of the return filed on 15.10.2012. The issue of non payment of the profit from 15.3.2007 to 7.7.2009 to the Applicant has been raised by the Applicant which has been disputed by the Non-applicants on the basis of the aforesaid clauses and the affidavit. Otherwise also, the same is not for me to decide. It only depends upon the decision of the existence of arbitration clause and   the arbitration application. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(10)\tSeparate reply has been filed by the Non-applicants No.1,2 and 4, Non-applicants No.6 and 7 as well as Non-applicants No.3 &amp; 5 to which  rejoinder has also been filed. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(11)\tDuring the course of arguments on 22.5.2013, the Applicant has not pressed the facts and submissions based on manipulation, misapplication of funds, fake and fabricated accounts,therefore, the same have not been included in the facts of the amended arbitration application and are also not being dealt with herein while deciding this arbitration application. However, the Applicant has pressed the averments and circumstances of concealment  of the profit amount, taken by him in para 13 and subsequent paras,which was learnt by him in the month of November, 2009 when a search was conducted by the Income Tax Department and a sum of Rs.5-6 Crores was surrendered by the Firm and further submissions based thereon.  The order sheet dated 22.5.2013 is as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">In the amended arbitration application, &#x27;counsel for the Applicant does not press the allegation of manipulation, mis-application of funds taken in para 8 of the arbitration application, although he has  not raised the issue of  fake and fabricated accounts in the amended arbitration application and even if there is some reference by inadvertence, then also he does not press the same. He pressed the averments  and circumstances mentioned in para 13 that most of the profit amount has been concealed in the accounts of the Firm and the consequences thereof referred in subsequent paras and further submissions based thereon.&#x27;\n\tArguments heard.

Thereafter, counsel for the Applicant has not pressed certain allegations of manipulation, mis-application of funds taken in para 8 of the arbitration application, although he has raised the issue of  fake and fabricated accounts in the amended arbitration application and even if there is some reference of inadvertence, then also he does not press the same. He pressed the averments that most of the profit amount has been concealed in the accounts of the Firm which has resulted into surrender of approximately Rs.5-6 Crores to the Income Tax Department in the month of November, 2009 as taken in para 13 and consequences thereof which the Applicant came to know after signing the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009. Therefore, the aforesaid additional objection raised by Mr.Surana does not survive.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">(15)\tI have gone through the arbitration application and further considered the preliminary objections  taken in the replies filed by the Non-applicants and further rejoinder filed by the Applicant to the aforesaid replies along with rival submissions of the counsel for the parties with the judgments cited by counsel for both the parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(i) Neither Clause 37 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 nor Clause 29 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009, which are couched in the same language, are arbitration clauses.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"974878\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1913246\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1850352\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1913246\" id=\"span_21\">(16)\tRegarding the Preliminary Objection No.(i), Mr.Maloo has placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1913246/\" id=\"a_4\">Jagdish Chander V.

If the terms of the agreement clearly indicate an intention on the part of the parties to the agreement to refer their disputes to a private tribunal for adjudication and a willingness to be bound by the decision of such tribunal on such disputes, it is arbitration agreement. While there is no specific form of an arbitration agreement, the words used should disclose a determination and obligation to go to arbitration and not merely contemplate the possibility of going for arbitration. Where there is merely a possibility of the parties agreeing to arbitration in future, as contrasted from an obligation to refer disputes to arbitration, there is no valid and binding arbitration agreement. \t                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1913246\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1850352\" id=\"span_24\">(iv) But mere use of the word arbitration in a clause will not make it an arbitration agreement, if it requires or contemplates a further or fresh consent of the parties for reference to arbitration.

Clause   10   of   the   Conditions   of   Contract   which   is   the   subject   of controversy reads thus: \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">       &quot;Clause   10:  The   Engineer-in-Charge   shall   have   power   to   make   any  alterations in or additions to the original specifications, drawings, designs  and   instructions   that   may   appear   to   him   necessary  and   advisable   during  the progress  of work,  and the contractor  shall be bound to carry out the work in accordance with any instructions which may be given to him in  writing   signed   by   the   Engineer-in-Charge   and   such   alterations   shall   not invalidate the contract, and any additional work which the contractor may  be directed to do in the manner above specified as part of the work shall be carried out by the contractor on the same conditions in all respects on   which   he   agreed   to   do   the   main   work,   and   at   the   same   rates   as   are specified in the tender for the main work. The time for the completion of the work shall be extended in the proportion that the additional work bears   to the original contract work and the certificate of the Engineer-in-Charge shall  be   conclusive   as   to   such   proportion.   And   if   the   additional   work includes any class of work for which no rate is specified in this contract,  then   such   class   of   work   shall   be   carried   out   at   the   rates   entered   in   the sanctioned   schedule   of   rates   of   the   locality   during   the   period   when   the        work is being carried on and if such last mentioned class of work is not entered   in   the   schedule   of   rates   of   the   district   then   the   contractor   shall within seven days of the date of the rate which it is his intention to charge for  such  class  of work,   and if  the  Engineer-in-Charge  does  not  agree  to this rate he shall be noticed in writing be at liberty to cancel his order to carry out such class of work and arrange to carry it out in such manner as he may consider advisable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">       No   deviations   from   the   specifications   stipulated   in  the contract  nor additional items of work shall ordinarily be carried out by the contractor,  nor shall any altered, additional or substituted work be carried out by him, unless   the  rates  of the  substituted,   altered  or additional   items  have  been approved and fixed in writing by the Engineer-in-Charge, the contractor    shall be bound to submit  his claim for any additional  work done during any month on or before the 15th days of the following month accompanied by   a     copy   of   the   order   in   writing   of   the   Engineer-in-Charge   for   the additional   work   and   that   the   contractor   shall   not   be   entitled   of   any payment in respect of such additional work if he fails to submit his claim within the aforesaid period:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">     Provided always that if the contractor shall commence work or incur any expenditure in respect thereof before the rates shall have been determined as lastly hereinbefore mentioned, in such case he shall only be entitled to             be paid in respect of the work carried out or expenditure incurred by him prior to the date of the determination of the rates as aforesaid according to such rate or rates as shall be fixed by the Engineer-in-Charge.

A reading of the said clause shows that it is a clause relating to power of the Engineer-in-Chief to make  additions and alterations in the drawings and specifications  and  execution of non-tendered  additional  items  of work (that   is   items   of   work   which   are   not   found   in   the   bill   of   quantities   or schedule of work). It provides for the following: \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">\t(a)   that the Engineer-in-charge could make additions and alterations in the drawings / specifications; and that such alterations and additions will   not   invalidate   the   contract, but   will   entitle   the   contractor   to  extension of time for completion of work proportionately; \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">\t(b)   that if the additional work be executed is an item for which the rate is not specified in the contract (or in the schedule of rates for the district), the contractor shall specify the rate and the Engineer-in-charge may either accept the rate or cancel the order to execute that                 particular work; \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">\t(c)  that   if   the   contractor   commences   the   work   with   reference   to   an item   for   which   there   is   no   rate   in   the   contract   and   there   is   no  agreement in regard to the rate for execution of such work, he shall be paid at the rates fixed by the Engineer-in -Charge; and \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">\t(d)    that   if   the   contractor   disputes   the   rate   fixed   by   the   Engineer-in-Charge,  the decision of the Superintending  Engineer  in regard to rate for such non-scheduled item shall be final. \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">22.    We   may   next   examine   whether   the   last   sentence   of   the   proviso   to clause   10   could   be   considered   to   be   an   arbitration   agreement.   It   does   not refer to arbitration as the mode of settlement of disputes. It does not provide for reference of disputes between the parties to arbitration. It does not make the decision of the Superintending Engineer binding on either party. It does not   provide   or   refer   to   any   procedure   which   would   show   that   the Superintending   Engineer   is   to   act   judicially   after   considering   the submissions of both parties.   It does not disclose any intention to make the Superintending Engineer an arbitrator in respect of disputes that may arise between   the   Engineer-in-Charge   and   the   contractor.   It   does   not   make   the decision of the Superintending Engineer final on any dispute, other than the claim  for   increase   in  rates   for   non-tendered   items.   It   operates   in  a   limited sphere, that is, where in regard to a non-tendered additional work executed by   the   contractor,   if   the   contractor   is   not   satisfied   with   the   unilateral determination   of   the   rate   therefor   by   the   Engineer-in-Charge   the   rate   for such work will be finally determined by the Superintending Engineer. It is a provision made with the intention to avoid future disputes regarding rates for non-tendered  item.  It is  not a provision  for reference of future disputes  or settlement of future disputes. The decision of superintending Engineer is not a   judicial   determination,   but   decision   of   one   party   which   is   open   to challenge   by   the  other   party   in  a   court   of  law.   The   said   clause   can   by   no stretch of imagination be considered to be an arbitration agreement. The said clause is not, and was never intended to be, a provision relating to settlement of disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">23.    That clause 10 was never intended to be an arbitration  agreement is evident from the contract itself. It is relevant to note the Standard Conditions of   Contract   of   the   state   government,   as   originally   formulated   consisted   a provision (Clause 23) relating to settlement of disputes by arbitration, which is extracted below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">      &quot;Except   where   otherwise   provided   in   the   contract, all questions   and disputes relating to the meaning of the specifications, designs, drawings and   instructions   herein   before   mentioned   and   as   to   the   quality   of        workmanship, or materials used on the work, or as to any other question, claim,   right,   matter   or   thing   whatsoever, in   any   way   arising   out   of   or        relating   to   the   contract,   designs,   drawing,   specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or these conditions, or otherwise concerning the work, or the execution, or failure to execute the same, whether arising during the progress of the work or after the completion or abandonment thereof shall  be   referred   to   the   sole   arbitration   of  a   Superintending   Engineer   of   the        State Public Works Department unconnected  with the work at any stage nominated   by   the   Chief   Engineer   concerned.   If   there   be   no   such Superintending   Engineer, it   should  be   referred   to  the   sole   arbitration   of Chief Engineer concerned. It will be no objection to any such appointment that the arbitrator so appointed is a government servant. The award of the         arbitrator   so   appointed   shall   be   final,   conclusive   and   binding   on   all  parties to this Contract.&quot; \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\t\t\t\t\t(emphasis supplied in original)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">24.   The   abovesaid   clause   was   deleted   by   the   State   Government   from   the   Standard Conditions   of   Contract   by   official   Memorandum   dated   24.12.1981. Contracts entered by the State Government thereafter did not have the said arbitration   clause,   though   the   other   Conditions   of   Contract   remained   the same.   The   contracts   in   all   these   cases   are of a   period   subsequent   to 24.12.1981 and the Conditions of Contract  forming part  of these contracts do   not   contain   the   arbitration   clause.   When   the   State   Government   has consciously   and   intentionally   deleted the  provision for  arbitration   from  its contracts, it will be a travesty of justice to read another clause in the contract providing   for   execution   of   non-tendered   items   and   the   method   of determination of the rates therefor, as a provision for arbitration.        (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">25.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168696\" id=\"span_26\">In fact, in <a href=\"/doc/168696/\" id=\"a_12\">Executive Engineer RCO vs. Suresh Chandra Panda</a> [1999 (9) SCC 92], this Court considered the effect of the said clause relating to execution of  non-tendered items, vis-`-vis clause 23 in a pre-1981 contract. This court held that the said clause (then numbered as clause 11, numbered as   clause   10  in   subsequent   contracts)   was  a   provision   which   excluded   the issue   relating   to   finality   of   rates,   from   the   scope   of   arbitration   agreement contained in clause 23 on the following reasoning: (SCC p.94,para 4)  \n\n      &quot;4.Under Clause 11 of the contract, there is an elaborate provision dealing  with   the   power   of   the   Engineer-in   Charge   to   make   any   alterations   or   additions to the original specifications, drawings, designs and instructions.         It,   inter   alia,   provides   that   if   for   such   alterations   or   additions   no   rate   is specified in the contract, then the rates which are entered in the sanctioned schedule of rates of the locality during the period when the work is being  carried out, would be paid. However, if this class of work, not provided for in the sanctioned schedule of rates then the contractor has the right, in the manner specified in that clause, to inform the Engineer-in-Charge of the   rate   at   which   he   intends   to   carry   out   that   work.   If   the   Engineer-in-Charge does not agree to this rate he is given the liberty to cancel his order and   arrange   to   carry   out   such   class   of   work   in   such   manner   as   he   may   consider advisable. The   clause   further   provides   that   if   the   contractor commences such additional work or incurs any expenditure in respect of it before the rate are determined as specified in that clause, then the rate or   rates shall be as fixed by the Engineer-in-Charge. In the event of a dispute, the   decision   of   the   Superintendent   Engineer   of   the   circle   will   be   final.  Under Clause 23, except as otherwise provided in the contract, all disputes  are   arbitrable   as   set   out   in   that   clause.   The   finality   of   rates,   therefore, under   Clause   11   is   a   provision   to   the   contrary   in   the   contract   which   is  excluded from Clause 23.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"974878\" id=\"span_27\"><a href=\"/doc/974878/\" id=\"a_13\">Powertech World Wide Limited V.

Ramesh Chander and others</a> (2007) 5 SCC 719 cited by Mr.G.K.Garg, is as under:</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">\t9. Para 16 of the partnership deed provides that if there is any dispute touching the partnership arising between the partners, the same shall be mutually decided by the parties or shall be referred to arbitration if the parties so determine. If the clause had merely said that in the event of disputes arising between the parties, they shall be referred to arbitration, it would have been an arbitration agreement. But the use of the words shall be referred for arbitration if the parties so determine completely changes the complexion of the provision. The expression determine indicates that the parties are required to reach a decision by application of mind. Therefore, when clause 16 uses the words the dispute shall be referred for arbitration if the parties so determine, it means that it is not an arbitration agreement but a provision which enables arbitration only if the parties mutually decide after due consideration as to whether the disputes should be referred to arbitration or not. In effect, the clause requires the consent of parties before the disputes can be referred to arbitration. The main attribute of an arbitration agreement, namely, consensus ad idem to refer the disputes to arbitration is missing in clause 16 relating to settlement of disputes. Therefore it is not an arbitration agreement, as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 7</a> of theAct. In the absence of an arbitration agreement, the question of exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 11</a> of the Act to appoint an arbitrator does not arise.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">\t\t\t\t\t                          (emphasis supplied)\n(19)\tThe clause 37 of the partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 (Anx.2) and Clause 29 of the partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 (Anx.3) are arbitration clauses which are applicable in the present case for the reason that the alleged amicable settlement is not amicable settlement of the profit and loss of the Applicant after working out the profit and loss of the firm as per the various clauses of the first reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and lastly reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009, as stated above. The said amicable settlement of capital amount will not debar  the Applicant  to raise the dispute of profit and loss  which came to his notice after the execution of the second reconstituted partnership dated 7.7.2009 when in November, 2009, a search was conducted by the Income Tax Department and an amount of Rs.5-6 Crores was surrendered which revealed that most of the profit amount has been concealed by the Firm  and further the Applicant was misled by the Non-applicants  in order to take undue advantage by not producing the entire balance sheet / correct balance sheet of the Firm, either before the Registrar of Firms or before this Court, after working out the profit of the Firm and he has disputed the fact that Annexure R-6/4 is not the notarised / true copy of Annexure A-1, reference of which has been made in the reconstituted partnership deed 7.7.2009 which was not produced either before the Registrar of Firms or this Court. The resolution of the dispute through arbitration award referred in Clause 37 of the partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and Clause 29 of the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 required no further consent of the parties or any determination before making the reference and further, the said Clauses  pre-supposes the right of reference and further the same would be binding also being an arbitration award, therefore, my finding is that the said Clauses are arbitration clauses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">(20)\tApart from the above, the Applicant is seeking compliance of the terms and conditions of the contract dated 15.3.2007 and 7.7.2009 and has not challenged any part of the agreement, the Arbitration Clause 29 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 survives and further, the capital amount settled in view of the arbitration agreement  dated 7.7.2009 has not been paid and further, profit and loss of the firm has not been determined and worked out separately for the Applicant, therefore, the Applicant is entitled to invoke the arbitration Clause 37 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and further reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009, are available to the Applicant for the purpose of appointment of the Arbitrator,  hence, the present arbitration application is maintainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">Regarding the Preliminary Objection No.(ii)  Clause 29 of Annexure-3 dated 7.7.2009 is not available to the Applicant in view of Clause 31 of the dissolution deed Anx.3. - Arbitration Clause 37 of the earlier first reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 will not survive after the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009. \t\t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">(21)\tSubmission of Mr.Maloo, Sr.Advocate is that the reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 containing arbitration clause 29 is applicable between the partners referred to therein in view of Clause 31 and not the retiring partner i.e. the Applicant. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">(22)\tReply of Mr.Garg to the preliminary objection No.(ii) is that Clause 29 of Annexure-3 is available to the Applicant since the Applicant is one of the signatories to the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 wherein the capital amount of investment has been worked out as Rs.78,71,000/- and no profit amount has been shown and the submission of the Non-applicants is that the disputes have been settled as per the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009, therefore, the same is applicable to the Applicant and the Non-applicants as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_20\">Sec.11(6)</a> of the Act of 1996 for appointment of the Arbitrator. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">(23)\tSubmission of Mr.G.K.Garg, Sr.Advocate is that the dispute arising out of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 still survives, therefore, Clause 37 of the same will not perish and the same continues to remain in operation and further, the accounts are  said to have been settled under the reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 therefore, the Arbitration Clause 37 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and Clause 29 of the further reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 are applicable for invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">section 11</a> of the Act of 1996 for appointment of Arbitrator. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">(24)\t In support of his reply to the aforesaid  preliminary objections, Mr.G.K.Garg, Sr.Advocate has cited the following judgments:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">\t(i) N.Srinivasa V.Kuttukaran Machine Tools Ltd.

It is well settled that even if an agreement ceases to exist, the arbitration clause remains in force and any dispute pertaining to the agreement ought to be resolved according to the conditions mentioned in the arbitration clause.

The statement of law expounded by Viscount Simon, L.C. In Heyman as noticed above, in our view, equally applies to the situation where the contract is terminated by one party on account of the breach committed by the other particularly in a case where the clause is framed in wide and general terms. Merely because the contract has come to an end by its termination due to breach, the arbitration clause does not get perished nor is rendered inoperative; rather it survives for resolution of disputes arising in respect of or with regard to or under the contract. This is in line with the earlier decisions of this Court, particularly as <a href=\"/doc/200767/\" id=\"a_23\">laid down in</a> Kishorilal Gupta.          (emphasis supplied) \n(25)\tMy conclusion to the Preliminary Objection No.(ii) is that the dispute is arising out of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 wherein the Applicant was a partner and further made entitled  for capital amount as per his share and profit amount, which was to be determined as per Clause 26 of the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009, therefore, arbitration clause  37 of the partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 remains operative and Clause 29 of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 will apply.</span>  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_33\">(26)\tMy prima facie conclusion with regard to the dispute of non payment of profit amount is that most of the profit amount has been concealed in the accounts of the Firm which has resulted in the surrender of Rs.5-6 Crores to the Income Tax Department in the month of November, 2009 which also reveal that the disputed amount of profit has also not been correctly worked out in order to mislead the Applicant and further to take undue advantage  by the Non-applicants, is disputed question of  fact and law made applicable thereon which is touching the merit of the case.

In our opinion, when a person signs a document, there is a presumption, unless there is proof of force or fraud, that he has read the document properly and understood it and only then he has affixed his signatures thereon, otherwise no signature on a document can ever be accepted. In particular, businessmen, being careful people (since their money is involved) would have ordinarily read and understood a document before signing it. Hence the  presumption would be even stronger in their case. There is no allegation of force or fraud in this case. Hence it is difficult to accept the contention of the respondent while admitting that the document, Ext.D-8 bears his signatures that it was signed under some mistake. We cannot agree with the view of the High Court on this question. On this ground alone, we allow this appeal, set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and remand the matter to the High Court for expeditious disposal in accordance with law.

Even otherwise we feel that once the parties have arrived at a settlement in respect of any dispute or difference arising under a contract and that dispute or the difference is amicably settled by way of a final settlement by and between the parties, unless that settlement is set aside in proper proceedings, it cannot lie in the mouth of one of the parties to the settlement to spurn it on the ground that it was a mistake and proceed to invoke the Arbitration clause. If  this is permitted the sanctity of contract, the settlement also being a contract, would be wholly lost and it would be open to one party to take the benefit under the settlement and then to question the same on the ground of mistake without having the settlement set aside. Ins the circumstances, we think that in the instant case since the dispute or difference was finally settled and payments were made as per the settlement, it was not open to the respondent unilaterally to treat the settlement as non est and proceed to invoke the Arbitration clause.

What is however clear is when a respondent contends that the dispute is not arbitrable on account of discharge of the contract under a settlement agreement or discharge voucher or no claim certificate, and the claimant contends that it was obtained by fraud, coercion or undue influence, the issue will have to be decided either by the Chief Justice / his designate in the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 11</a> of the Act or by the Arbitral Tribunal as directed by the order under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 11</a> of the Act.

We may next examine some related and incidental issues. Firstly, we may refer to the consequences of discharge of a contract. When a contract has been fully performed, there is a discharge of the contract by performance, and the contract comes to an end. In regard to such a discharged contract, nothing remains  neither any right to seek performance nor any obligation to perform. In short, there cannot be any dispute. Consequently, there cannot obviously be reference to arbitration of any dispute arising from a discharged contract. Whether the contract has been discharged by performance or not is a mixed question of fact and law, and if there is a dispute in regard to that question, that is arbitrable. But there is an exception. Where both the parties to a contract confirm in writing that the contract has been fully and finally discharged by performance of all obligations and there are no outstanding claims or disputes, courts will not refer  any subsequent claim or dispute to arbitration. Similarly, where one of the parties to the contract issues a full and final discharge voucher (or no dues certificate, as the case may be) confirming that he has received the payment in full and final satisfaction of all claims, and he has no outstanding claim, that amounts to discharge of the contract by acceptance of performance and the party issuing the discharge voucher / certificate cannot thereafter make any fresh claim or revive any settled claim nor can it seek reference to arbitration in respect of any claim.

When we refer to a discharge of contract by an agreement signed by both the parties or by execution of a full and final discharge voucher / receipt by one of the parties, we refer to an agreement or discharge voucher which is validly and voluntarily executed. If the party which has executed the discharge agreement or discharge voucher, alleges that the execution of such discharge agreement or voucher was on account of fraud / coercion / undue influence practised by the other party and is able to establish the same, then obviously the discharge of the contract by such agreement / voucher is rendered void and cannot be acted upon. Consequently, any dispute raised by such party would be arbitrable.\t\t               \t\t\t (emphasis supplied)\n(31)\tIn <a href=\"/doc/1682326/\" id=\"a_35\">Union of India and others V.

It was observed that issuance of full and final discharge voucher or no-dues certificate of that kind amounts to discharge of the contract by acceptance or performance and the party issuing the discharge voucher / certificate  cannot thereafter make any fresh  claim or revive any settled claim nor can it seek reference to arbitration in respect of any claim.</span> \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">16.

The Applicant who had signed the reconstituted partnership deed has not filed the arbitration application for reopening the alleged amicable settlement but he has filed this arbitration application for compliance of the terms and conditions of the reconstituted partnership deed dated 15.3.2007 and 7.7.2009 so far as it relates to the non-payment of full capital amount as well as profit and loss worked out after preparing the entire account of the firm.

Therefore, the earlier contract extinguished and its arbitration clause perishes with it and further both the parties settled the issue that the delay in completion of the project was attributable to causes that were beyond the control of the contractor and they undertook and guaranteed that they will not seek any further action including arbitration or civil suit under the contract for any issues of any nature whatsoever.

Counsel for the applicant further submits that the undertakings / amicable settlement dated 15.11.2007, relied upon by the Non-applicant as full and final settlement, were obtained by the Non-applicant under the influence and coercion exercised by it, using its dominant position, therefore, the said undertakings are  not tenable in law and the settlement(s)  cannot be termed as mutual settlement signed voluntarily.

In Reshmi Construction, the question of novation of contract was not raised as referred to hereinabove in para 26. However, the Supreme Court in para 39(xi) has drawn a conclusion that in P.K. Ramaiah and Nathani Steels the contract agreement containing arbitration clause was substituted by another contract and such a question is to be considered and determined in each individual case having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein.

Ramaiah in para 34 of <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_45\">National Insurance Co.</a> (supra) and it was concluded that the Court was satisfied that there were negotiations and voluntary settlement of all pending disputes and therefore, there could be no arbitral issue.</span> \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">(36)\tAdverting to the fact situation of this case, the issue of terms and conditions of the alleged voluntary undertakings / amicable settlements dated 15.11.2007 has been raised by the Non-applicant whereas the Applicant submits that the undertakings/amicable settlements, relied upon by the Non-applicant as full and final settlement were  obtained by the Non-applicant under the influence and coercion exercised by it, using its dominant position, therefore, I have to find out whether in the fact situation of the present case, there has been mutual agreement with regard to the terms and conditions of the amicable settlement and further the Applicant has signed the undertakings/mutual settlements dated 15.11.2007 voluntarily by recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations under the contract so that neither the contract nor the arbitration agreement survived, which bars reference to the Arbitrator. The dispute with regard to the delay in completion of the project attributable to the non-applicant was going on leading to the compensation events much prior to the undertakings dated 15.11.2007  and the payment was not  released, the Applicant was left with no other alternative except to sign the undertakings/amicable settlements. However, the payment was released subsequently.  Considering the ratio of the judgment cited by Dr. P.C. Jain to the fact situation of the present case, I am of the view that the same are distinguished on the present fact situation of this case, as discussed hereinabove, and the judgments cited by Mr. Mehta are applicable on the issue that there is no novation of contract.  Since the payment was withheld by the Non-applicant and the Applicant was under the pressure that the same will not be released unless the undertakings / amicable settlements were signed, the Non-applicant was in a dominant position. Therefore, considering the present fact situation of this case, as discussed hereinabove, I record my preliminary satisfaction that the Non-applicant, who was in a dominant position, obtained  the undertakings / amicable settlements dated 15.11.2007 under undue influence and coercion, hence, the terms of the mutual agreement cannot be said to be settled mutually and there has been no novation of contract and further,  neither the original contract extinguished nor arbitration clause 21 of the original contract perishes which will bar reference to the Arbitrator and the arbitration Clause 21 of the original contract, to which the Applicant is a party, will survive. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"48449\" id=\"span_49\">(37)\tThe said Question No.(i) can only be conclusively decided after taking evidence of both the parties. The said question is discretionary for me to decide  as per para 22.2(b) of National Insurance Co.  and para 14 of <a href=\"/doc/48449/\" id=\"a_46\">Indian Oil Corporation</a> (supra) and in my view, evidence is required on the issue of dominant position, undue influence and coercion, as raised by the Applicant, which has been disputed by the Non-applicant by submitting that the said undertakings / amicable settlements were signed voluntarily, therefore, I am leaving the said issue to be decided by the Sole Arbitrator.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">Consideration of Question No.(ii)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">(ii) having  accepted full and final payment, the applicant is estopped from raising the dispute under  arbitration clause No.21 of the original contract, which would stand discharged, therefore, no arbitral issue is involved in the matter ?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">(38)\tSubmission of the counsel for the Non-applicant is that even  if this Court comes to the conclusion that the arbitration Clause 21 of the contract survives, then also, having accepted full and final payment, the Applicant is estopped from raising the dispute under clause 21 of the original agreement  which stood discharged whereas the submission of Mr. Mehta, learned Sr. Advocate is that  the  dispute regarding the delay on the part of the Non-applicant was raised by the Applicant for the first time on 26.7.2007 prior to the undertakings/amicable settlements dated 15.11.2007. The  genuine and  legitimate claims of the Applicant against the Non-applicant cannot be foreclosed by referring to the undertakings / amicable settlements dated 15.11.2007 which were neither signed voluntarily nor the terms of the same were settled mutually.  Since the payment of the Applicant was to be released, the Applicant was left with no option except to accept the terms of the undertakings/amicable settlements and sign it, therefore, mere acceptance of the claim, which would not discharge the parties from all rights, obligations and remedies under the contract, will not estop the Applicant from raising genuine and legitimate claim and the same is an arbitral issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">(39)\tQuestion  No.(ii) is with regard to estoppel. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_50\">In  the latest case of <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_47\">R.L. Kalathia &amp; Co.</a> (supra) cited by Mr. Mehta, learned counsel for the applicant, their Lordships of the Supreme Court after considering the various judgments including Reshmi Constructions and National Insurance Co.  laid down three principles according to which mere acceptance of the bill would not be an absolute bar to the  contractor for raising claims which are genuine and even after submission of  &#x27;no such-claim&#x27;.  In Asian Tech., National Insurance Co., Reshmi Construction Co.,  Port of Calcutta, Bharat Drillings have been considered and it has been held that even in the case of discharge/settlement voucher/ no dues certificate, are arbitral issues and the Court can go into the question whether the liability has been satisfied or not.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">(40)\tNow, adverting to the fact situation of the present case, on Question No.(ii) with regard to estoppel, the contractor was raising the dispute that the delay in completion of the project is attributable to the Non-applicant and he is entitled for compensation on account of the said delay but his payment was not released unless he signed the undertakings / amicable settlements which according to him were not signed voluntarily and the terms of the same were not settled mutually. The full and final payment was received by the Applicant  subject to the rights and contentions available to it  under law and as such, the said payment cannot be related to the undertakings / amicable settlements dated 15.11.2007 so given under undue influence and coercion exercised by the non-applicant using its dominant position. The cases - Nathani Steels, P.K. Ramaiah and Nav Bharat Builders,  cited by Dr.P.C.Jain on the issue of estoppel, are also distinguished on present fact situation of this case, as discussed hereinabove.  The judgment in the case of Indian Oil Corporation cited by Dr. P.C. Jain is of res judicata and not of estoppel and  in the aforesaid judgments cited by Mr. Mehta, the issue of estoppel has been held to be arbitral issue. On the Question No.(ii) relating to estoppel,  considering the present fact situation of this case, as discussed hereinabove, I record my preliminary satisfaction  that payment has been accepted by the Applicant subject to the rights and contentions available to it under law  which would not discharge the original contract, by recording satisfaction of all rights and obligations under the contract, and the same will not foreclose  the right of reference under Clause 21 of the original contract by referring to the three undertakings / amicable settlements dated 15.11.2007 and the said issue is arbitral. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_51\">(41)\tThe said Question No.(ii) of estoppel can also be conclusively decided after taking evidence of both the parties and it is also discretionary for me to decide as per Para 22.2.(b) of <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_48\">National Insurance Co.</a> (supra), therefore, I am leaving the said issue to be conclusively decided by the Sole Arbitrator.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48449\" id=\"span_52\">(42)\tThe dispute of delay in completion of the project is attributable to the non-applicant or not ?, for which the Applicant is entitled for compensation or not ? are the issues which are required to be decided by the Sole Arbitrator after recording evidence of the parties. Both the aforesaid Questions No.(i) and (ii) relate to Second Category in Para 22.2.(b) of National Insurance Co.  and para 14 of the <a href=\"/doc/48449/\" id=\"a_49\">Indian Oil Corporation</a> (supra) which requires evidence, therefore, I am leaving them to the decision of the Sole Arbitrator.             (emphasis supplied)\n\n(43)\tAs mentioned in the arbitration application, the Applicant suffered heavily during the execution of the work and incurred additional costs on account of delay in completion of the project, alleged on the part of the Non-applicant, leading to the aforesaid compensation events and therefore, the contract price was required to be adjusted as per Clause 38.3 so as to adequately compensate the Applicant for the delays on the part of the Non-applicant.  The Applicant presented its claim for compensation of Rs.63,85,109/- along with the notice under Clause 21 of the Contract Agreement on 5.2.2008 to the Superintending Engineer, who was the Engineer In-charge. The Superintending Engineer summarily rejected the claim on 20th March, 2008 (Annexure-3). Having recorded dissatisfaction on the decision of the Engineer In-charge, another notice dated  11.4.2008 (Anx.4) for commencement of arbitration was given within 28 days as per clause 21.2. The reply to the notice dated 11.4.2008  (Anx.4) was received on 20.5.2008 (Anx.5) whereby the request for commencement of the arbitration was not accepted by the Non-applicant; then within 56 days a notice for  appointment of Arbitrator was given as per clause no.21.3 and when  no settlement was made with regard to the delay, further notice dated 10.7.2008 under clause 21.4 with the intention to commence the arbitral proceedings  and suggesting the name of Mr. Justice SN Bhargava (Former Chief Justice of Sikkim High Court) was sent by the applicant. Thus, it is clear that the arbitral procedure as prescribed under Clause 21 of the Contract Data has been followed by the Applicant and, therefore, the Applicant is entitled for a reference to the Arbitrator.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">(39)\tOn consideration of the aforesaid submissions along with the judgments, I am of the prima facie view that the settlement referred to in the reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009 is not an amicable settlement, more particularly, with regard to the share of the Applicant in the profit and loss of the firm after working out the entire accounts of the firm from 15.3.2007 to 7.7.2009 (Anx.A-1) but the same refers to the Applicant without working out the profit and loss of the firm and further, the agreed amount of Rs.78,71,000/- has not been paid to the Applicant so far except Rs.46,000/- in cash, therefore, the aforesaid bona fide dispute  of non-payment of profit in accordance with the balance sheet of the Firm from 15.3.2007 to 7.7.2009 still exists between the parties. Thus, the  present case is not reopening the settlement  referred in the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009  and the Applicant is also not asking to reopen the same but simply making a request for reference of the non-payment of the capital amount as well as working out of the profit and loss of the firm and further payment of his share  i.e. 27.50% between 15.3.2007 and 7.7.2009, therefore, bona fide arbitral dispute survives  for making payment of the profit amount as per the clause 26 of the last reconstituted partnership deed dated 7.7.2009, as discussed hereinabove, which is required to be decided after production of evidence by both the parties before the Arbitrator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">(40)\tOn merit, Mr.Maloo submitted that the amount of Rs.78,71,000/- is inclusive of profit and they could not make compliance of the same as the Applicant  has not en-cashed the first cheque. His further submission is that   determination of the capital amount and profit and loss of the firm and payment thereof to the Applicant, the same are not relevant for the purpose of deciding the arbitration application as in case the same are decided, then it will touch the merit of the case. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">(41)\tIn view of the above, I deem  it proper to appoint the Arbitrator in this arbitration application. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">(42)\tAccordingly, the arbitration application is allowed and Mr.Justice Anoop Chand Goyal, Former Judge of this Court is appointed as the Arbitrator  and the matter is referred to him for resolving the dispute between the parties arising out of the reconstituted partnership deeds dated 15.3.2007 and 7.7.2009.  The Sole Arbitrator  will fix his fee according to the Arbitration Manual. All objections, except the existence of the arbitration clauses, would be open to be raised by the Non-applicants before the Arbitrator. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">(43)\tA copy of this order be sent to Mr.Justice Anoop Chand Goyal, Former Judge, D-19-B, Seema Sadan, Meera Marg, Bani Park, Jaipur.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77810103\" id=\"span_53\">S.B.
