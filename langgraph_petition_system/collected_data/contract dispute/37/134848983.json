It is stated by the petitioner that the MoU was a separate\n     and distinct agreement vis-a-vis the SHA and the Share Purchase\n     Agreement dated April 12, 1996, as, evident from their respective\n     terms, the MoU was binding on the members of the Prakash\n     family inter-se and SHA was binding as between the Prakash\n     Family shareholders and Reuters. Subsequent thereto, the terms\n     of the MoU were included in the Articles of Association of the\n     Company which were amended on May 14, 1996 (Articles of\n     1996) after the investment by Reuters to recognize and\n     acknowledge the special rights that were existing in the MoU.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">     The Articles of 1996 continued to be operative till August 30,\n     2012 and demonstrate how the MoU was fully acted upon and\n     recognized by the parties thereto. However, on August 30, 2012,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">ARB.

However, this did not and was\n     never intended to, modify the arrangement inter-se the Prakash\n     Family. Indeed, the Company once again adopted the Articles of\n     1996 on 26 March 2014, before adopting the Articles as it exists\n     in the current form in September 2014. It is therefore clear that\n     the Prakash Family Members who have each benefited from the\n     MoU and the resultant partnership with Reuters remained bound,\n     and continue to be bound, inter-se by the terms of the MoU\n     irrespective of changes to the Articles.

It is also stated that it\n     is a well settled principle of company law that a share of any\n     member in a company is movable property and is transferable in\n     the manner provided by the Articles of the company.

Therefore, the language\n     of the Articles as it then stood reflected the intention of the\n     parties to be bound by terms set out in the Articles itself, both in\n     respect of dealings inter-se Prakash Family Shareholders and in\n     respect of their dealings with Reuters.

It operated in the field of inter-se family\n     arrangements, the basis for this being the the fact that respondent\n     No.3, Prem Prakash had gifted the shares to respondent Nos. 1\n     and 2 and petitioner was the person who was responsible along\n     with respondent No.3 for the growth of the business. He also\n     stated, it was only because of the petitioner&#x27;s efforts that Reuters\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">ARB.

The whole purpose of the MoU\n     was to define rights of the family members between themselves\n     and to guarantee petitioner a right to purchase the shares in case\n     of transfer or transmission by any family member. SHA on the\n     other hand is an agreement between two groups of shareholders\n     i.e. Prakash Family Shareholders and Reuters and extensively\n     defines the special rights of the Reuters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">     47.     It is also stated by Mr. Nayar that respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2\n     having received benefits under the MoU including huge monetary\n     benefits with the induction of Reuters as a shareholder of the\n     Company, which was facilitated by the petitioner in terms\n     Clause 6 of the MoU, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 are estopped\n     from questioning the MoU.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">     48.     It is further stated by Mr. Nayar, drawing the attention of\n     the Court to clause 16 of the SHA, the plea of respondent Nos. 1\n     &amp; 2 that arbitration clause, clause 16, under the SHA should have\n     been invoked instead of arbitration clause under the MoU is\n     untenable as the said clause pertains only to disputes arising\n     under the SHA and in the present case, the petitioner, being a\n     dominus litis, is asserting the rights under the MoU. Moreover,\n     the said clause is intended for disputes between Reuters and\n     Prakash Family which is why it provides that the mediation\n     would be between Reuters and Chairperson (respondent No.3) to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">ARB.

It is also stated that\n     as per clause 16, on the failure of mediation talks, the disputes\n     will be referred to London Court of International Arbitration to\n     be resolved as per English Law and the present dispute being a\n     family dispute between parties in respect of shares in an Indian\n     Company, contracting out of Indian law would be opposed to\n     public policy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">     49.

Mr. Arun Kathpalia, learned Senior Counsel, also\n     appearing for the petitioner, in addition to the similar submissions\n     made by Mr. Nayar, has drawn the attention of this Court various\n     Articles of the SHA to contend that the SHA does not supersede\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">ARB.

In support of his contention it is stated by Mr.\n     Kathpalia that SHA describes itself as an agreement executed\n     between the Prakash Family Shareholders and Reuters with\n     Article 1.1. of the SHA defining Prakash Family Members as a\n     group with certain group rights and Reuters Group as Reuters, its\n     holding company and such holding company&#x27;s subsidiaries for\n     the time being, respectively. Further, it is his submission that\n     <a href=\"/doc/1200881/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 1.1</a> defines &#x27;Artificial Deadlock&#x27; as a management\n     deadlock caused by virtue of Prakash Family Members (as one\n     group) or Reuters (as another group) voting against an issue or\n     proposal to contend that the SHA essentially defines the issues\n     with regard to the management of the Company as between\n     Prakash Family Members as one group and Reuter as an another\n     group and that the terms of the SHA do not in any manner touch\n     upon the terms of the MoU which governs the rights and\n     obligations of the rights and obligations of the Prakash Family\n     members inter-se. In other words, the subject matter as well as\n     the purpose of the two agreements are distinct, which also goes\n     for the dispute resolution clauses in both the agreements.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">     52.

The MoU constitutes a special\n     arrangement between family shareholders with a succession plan\n     and management and ensured that the petitioner remained in\n     control of Company. In other words, it is his submission that the\n     MoU was executed between the Prakash Family members inter-\n     se to regulate the 51 % shareholding of the Company and the\n     same falls under the scope of the MoU and not under the SHA\n     and the MoU is binding only on the Prakash Family while SHA is\n     binding as between Prakash Family Shareholders and Reuters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">     53.       It is also stated by Mr. Kathpalia, the contention of the\n     respondent Nos. 1 &amp; 2 that the MoU was superseded by the SHA\n     is ex-facie belied as clause 8 of the MoU was incorporated in\n     <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 11 (i)</a> of the Articles of Association by the subsequent\n     amendment on May 14, 1996 after the execution of the SHA on\n     April      12,    1996,    which     would     not   have     been\n     incorporated/amended if the MoU had been superseded.

And since, as per Clause 28 of the SHA\n     any or all prior agreements, arrangements etc. are superseded the\n     fundamental question which needs to be decided by this Court\n     before referring the parties to the Arbitration is the validity and\n     existence of a contract having an arbitration clause which has\n     been novated / superseded as the parties cannot invoke a clause\n     which     has   been    perished     with      a   new   subsequent\n     understanding/contract i.e., once a contract/agreement has been\n     superseded or extinguished by a subsequent contract/agreement,\n     the arbitration clause being a component of the superseded\n     contract/agreement stands superseded along with the terms of\n     superseded contract/agreement. Further, it is submitted by them\n     that issue of novation/supersession is not a preliminary issue and\n     beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 16</a> of the\n     Act as the Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_58\">section 16</a> of the Act is not\n     empowered to decide upon any issue if the appointment of the\n     Ld.

In this\n     regard they have relied upon two Apex Court judgments in\n     <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_61\">Union of India v.

It is also submitted by them that\n     Clauses 4, 11, 12, 14 and Schedule 1 are the only valid and\n     binding restrictions on the shareholders of the Company and even\n     otherwise specifically override Clauses 8-10 of the alleged MoU.\n     Similarly, in terms of the provisions of Cause 28 of the SHA,\n     Clause 16 of the SHA shall unambiguously override Clause 12 of\n     the alleged MoU.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">     74.

In fact, the SHA has been executed by all the\n     shareholders of the Prakash Family in their individual capacity\n     and not by one person representing the family or &#x27;block&#x27; as\n     contended by the ld. Counsels for the petitioner. The term\n     shareholder has also been defined under Clause 1.1 of the SHA\n     as:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">           &quot;Shareholders means each of the Prakash Family\n           Shareholders and Reuters.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_102\">     86.     The learned Senior Counsels appearing for the petitioner\n     have relied heavily on Clause 1.1 as well as Clause 16 of the\n     SHA to further the plea that the SHA has been executed by the\n     Prakash Family as a group/bloc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">     87.     In so far as Clause 16 is concerned, dispute resolution\n     clause under the SHA, the same contemplates resolution of\n     dispute between shareholders and on failure of the shareholders\n     to amicably resolve the dispute within 30 days from service of\n     notice, the same shall be referred to the Managing Director of\n     Reuters having responsibility for India and the Chairman of the\n     Company/ANI. It cannot be said that the Clause 16 is intended\n     only for disputes between Reuters and Prakash Family, as the\n     said clause contemplates dispute between &#x27;shareholders&#x27; who\n     have been defined as individual shareholders of both Prakash\n     Family and Reuters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">     88.     In so far as Clause 1.1 is concerned, the same defines\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">ARB. PET. 4/2020                                                  Page 48/56</span>\n      &#x27;artificial deadlock&#x27; as a management deadlock caused by virtue\n     of the Prakash Family Shareholders or Reuters voting against an\n     issue or proposal in circumstances where the approval of the\n     same is required for the functioning of the Company as per\n     approved plans. No doubt,     Mr. Kathpalia, Mr. Nayar and Mr.\n     Sethi may be right in contending that there exist a contemplation\n     of groups viz. Prakash Family Members and Reuters under the\n     SHA, but the same is in a particular fact situation of deadlock\n     then the Prakash Family Members and Reuters act as &#x27;blocks&#x27;,\n     which does not mean that SHA does not recognize Prakash\n     Family Shareholders in their individual capacity. More so, as per\n     the opening paragraph, the term &#x27;parties&#x27; envisages Prakash\n     Family Shareholders both individually as well as collectively.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">     89.     Clause 28.2 (reproduced above), contemplates a situation\n     where the &#x27;parties&#x27; agree that SHA supersedes any or all prior\n     agreements,     understandings,      arrangements,      promises,\n     representations, warranties and/or contracts of any form or\n     nature whatsoever, whether oral or in writing and whether\n     explicit or implicit, which may have been entered into prior to\n     the date hereof between the parties, except for Ancillary\n     Agreement and SPA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_106\">     90.     A conjoint reading of the Clause 28.2 with the opening\n     paragraph of SHA therefore necessarily means that any kind of\n     agreement as detailed in Clause 28.2, &#x27;between the parties&#x27; shall\n     stand superseded as per Clause 28.2.         So, it follows the\n     shareholders of Prakash Family having being individually\n     recognized under the SHA as parties, the MoU, an agreement, as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">ARB. PET. 4/2020                                                      Page 49/56</span>\n      relied upon by the petitioner which governs the inter-se rights\n     and obligations of the Prakash Family stands superseded.      It is\n     not the case of the Ld. Counsel for the petitioner that the SHA\n     does not deal with inter-se rights of the members / shareholders\n     of the Prakash Family. The plea of Mr. Nayar that MoU was\n     entered by Prakash Family to define their family arrangement\n     before the Reuters came in by purchasing the shares and hence\n     cannot be overridden by the SHA is not appealing. Nothing\n     precluded the members of the Prakash Family to include a\n     stipulation in the SHA, that the SHA, shall not supersede the\n     MoU, as has been specially stated in Clause 28.2 with regard to\n     ancillary agreements and share purchase agreement. The plea of\n     Mr. Nayar, that the present dispute between the parties being in\n     respect of shares in an Indian company to be resolved by London\n     Court of International Arbitration as per English law, contracting\n     out of Indian Law is opposed to public policy is also not\n     appealing as such an issue doesn&#x27;t arise in these proceedings\n     which have been filed by invoking the MoU. Nor such a plea\n     would revive the MoU, which stands novated by the SHA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">     91.     In so far as the plea of Mr. Kathpalia and Mr. Sethi that\n     the plea of Dr. Singhvi and Mr. Srinivasan that MoU is\n     superseded by SHA is belied as Clause 8 of MoU was\n     incorporated in Articles of Association by the subsequent\n     amendment on May 14, 1996 after the execution of the SHA on\n     April 12, 1996 would not have been incorporated had MoU been\n     superseded, is not appealing, firstly, as the effect of Clause 28.2\n     of SHA is that the MoU stands superseded. Assuming, if a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">ARB.

Further it can be said, that para\n     materia clause was incorporated in Articles of Association,\n     knowing well that as MoU stands superseded a stipulation similar\n     to Clause 8 should be incorporated in Articles of Association.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">     92.     The plea of Mr. Kathpalia that proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1176490/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 58 (2)</a>\n     of the Companies Act recognizes private arrangements outside\n     Articles of Association for transfer of shares like MoU has no\n     relevance to the issue which falls for consideration.

It is trite law that to attract the theory of novation as per\n     <a href=\"/doc/595325/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 62</a> of the Contract Act, there should be total substitution\n     of the earlier contract and its terms and all the terms of the earlier\n     contract should perish with it. <a href=\"/doc/595325/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 62</a> of the Contract Act\n     reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">             &quot;62.

We shall now notice some of the authoritative statements\n         in the text-books and a few of the cases bearing on the\n         question raised : In Chitty on Contract, 21st Edn., the scope\n         of an arbitration clause is stated thus, at p. 322 :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">              &quot;So that the law must be now taken to be that when an\n              arbitration clause is unqualified such a clause will\n              apply even if the dispute involve an assertion that\n              circumstances had arisen whether before or after the\n              contract had been partly performed which have the\n              effect of discharging one or both parties from liability,\n              e.g., repudiation by one party accepted by the other, or\n              frustration.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">         15. In &quot;Russel on Arbitration&quot;, 16th Edn., p. 63, the following\n         test is laid down to ascertain whether an arbitration clause\n         survives after the contract is determined:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">               &quot;The test in such cases has been said to be whether the\n               contract is determined by something outside itself, in\n               which case the arbitration clause is determined with it, or\n               by something arising out of the contract, in which case\n               the arbitration clause remains effective and can be\n               enforced.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">         xxx                xxx                       xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">      20. These observations throw considerable light on the question\n      whether an arbitration clause can be invoked in the case of a\n      dispute under a superseded contract. The principle is obvious; if\n      the contract is superseded by another, the arbitration clause,\n      being a component part of the earlier contract, falls with it. The\n      learned Law Lord pin-points the principle underlying his\n      conclusion at p. 347:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">               &quot;I am accordingly of opinion that what is commonly\n               called repudiation or total breach of a contract, whether\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">ARB.

The\n             contract is not put out of existence, though all further\n             performance of the obligations undertaken by each party\n             in favour of the other may cease. It survives for the\n             purpose of measuring the claims arising out of the\n             breach, and the arbitration clause survives for\n             determining the mode of their settlement. The purposes of\n             the contract have failed, but the arbitration clause is not\n             one of the purposes of the contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">       21. Lord Wright, after explaining the scope of the word\n       &quot;repudiation&quot; and the different meanings its bears, proceeded\n       to state at p. 350 :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">             &quot;In such a case, if the repudiation is wrongful and the\n             rescission is rightful, the contract is ended by the\n             rescission; but only as far as concerns future\n             performance. It remains alive for the awarding of\n             damages, either for previous breaches, or for the breach\n             which constitutes the repudiation. That is only a\n             particular form of contract breaking and would generally,\n             under an ordinary arbitration clause, involve a dispute\n             under the contract like any other breach of contract.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">       22. This decision is not directly in point; but the principles laid\n       down therein are of wider application than the actual decision\n       involved. If an arbitration clause is couched in widest terms as\n       in the present case, the dispute, whether there is frustration or\n       repudiation of the contract, will be covered by it. It is not\n       because the arbitration clause survives, but because, though\n       such repudiation ends the liability of the parties to perform the\n       contract, it does not put an end to their liability to pay\n       damages for any breach of the contract. The contract is still in\n       existence for certain purposes. But where the dispute is\n       whether the said contract is void ab initio, the arbitration\n       clause cannot operate on those disputes, for its operative force\n       depends upon the existence of the contract and its validity. So\n       too, if the dispute is whether the contract is wholly superseded\n       or not by a new contract between the parties, such a dispute\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">ARB.

The argument, therefore,\n        that the legal position is the same whether the dispute is in\n        respect of repudiation or frustration or novation is not borne\n        out by these decisions. .......&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">     95.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545494\" id=\"span_81\">In <a href=\"/doc/1545494/\" id=\"a_105\">Damodar Valley Corporation v.

It may also be open to the parties\n              to terminate the previous contract and substitute in its\n              place a new contract or alter the original contract in\n              such a way that it cannot subsist. In all these cases,\n              since the entire contract is put an end to the arbitration\n              clause, which is a part of it, also perishes along with it,\n              <a href=\"/doc/595325/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 62</a> of the Contract Act incorporates this\n              principle when it provides that if this parties to a\n              contract agree to substitute a new contract or to rescind\n              or alter it, the original contract need not be performed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">              Where, therefore, the dispute between the parties is that\n              the contract itself does not subsist either as a result of its\n              being substituted by a new contract or by rescission or\n              alteration, that dispute cannot be referred to the\n              arbitration as the arbitration clause itself would perish\n              if the averment is found to be valid. As the very\n              jurisdiction of the arbitrator is dependent upon the\n              existence of the arbitration clause under which he is\n              appointed, the parties have no right to invoke a clause\n              which perishes with the contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">              8.

In such a situation the rescission would put an\n              end to the performance of the contract in future, but it\n              may remain alive for claiming damages either for\n              previous breaches or for the breach which constituted\n              the termination.

On similar lines the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/142820901/\" id=\"a_111\">Larsen and\n     Toubro Ltd. v.

An arbitration\n     agreement being a creation of an agreement may be destroyed by\n     agreement. That is to say, if the contract is superseded by\n     another, the arbitration clause, being a component/part of the\n     earlier contract, falls with it or if the original contract in entirety\n     is put to an end, the arbitration clause, which is a part of it, also\n     perishes along with it. Hence, the arbitration clause of the MoU,\n     being Clause 12, having perished with the MoU, owing to\n     novation, the invocation of arbitration under the MoU is\n     belied/not justified.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"98159847\" id=\"span_88\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"115852355\" id=\"span_89\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"23402471\" id=\"span_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"49992145\" id=\"span_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"43502055\" id=\"span_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"133653680\" id=\"span_93\">99.
