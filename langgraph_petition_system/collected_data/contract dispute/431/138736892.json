Workmen as represented by\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                      Page 1 of 38</span>\n New Delhi General Mazdoor Union).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2       The petitioner claims to have entered into a contract with M/s.\nDelhi Guard and Security Services (DGSS), for providing security\npersonnel in the SCOPE complex. It claims that the said contract had\nbeen terminated w.e.f. 11th May 1991, whereafter all dues, in respect\nof the workmen engaged through DGSS were settled, and no further\nservice was rendered by the said workmen. The Tribunal, by the\nimpugned order dated 16th February 1996, has held the contract,\nbetween the petitioner and DGSS, not to be genuine.               Following\nthereupon, and as a sequel thereto, the Tribunal has, vide the\nimpugned award dated 2nd December 2003, directed the regularization,\nof the workmen who had petitioned it, w.e.f. 1st January 1990, with\nconsequential benefits.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.      The industrial dispute, wherein the impugned order dated 16th\nFebruary 1996 and the impugned award dated 02nd December 2003,\ncame to be passed, was initiated vide Order of Reference\nNo.F.24(1219)/95-Lab dated 20th July 1995, of the Secretary (Labour),\nGovt. of NCT of Delhi, containing the following term of reference:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;Whether the workmen mentioned in Annexure-A are entitled to\n        absorption/regularization by the management of S.C.O.P.E. and if so,\n        what directions are necessary in this regard?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1309191\" id=\"span_2\">4.      Before me, Mr. Vinay Bhasin, learned senior counsel appearing\nfor the petitioner, confined his submission to the issue of validity of\nthe aforementioned reference, dated 20th July 1995, made by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                             Page 2 of 38</span>\n Secretary Labour, Govt of NCT of Delhi. In his submission, the\nreference ought to have been made by the Central Government, and\nnot by the State Government. As such, the proceedings before the\nTribunal, he would contend, stand vitiated ab initio, emanating, as\nthey do, from a reference incompetently made. He contends, in this\ncontext, that the issue is no more res integra being fully covered by an\nearlier judgment of a learned Single Judge of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1309191/\" id=\"a_1\">Standing\nConference of Public Enterprises v Government of NCT of Delhi,\n(W.P (C</a>) 11782/2004). Mr. Salman Khurshid, learned senior counsel\nfor the respondent, advanced his submissions by way of rebuttal\nthereto. In view of the limited submissions advanced at the Bar, I\npassed the following order, on 27th October 2017:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot;Arguments have been advanced on behalf of the petitioner and\n        respondent by Mr. Vinay Bhasin and Mr. Salman Khurshid, learned\n        senior counsel, respectively.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        Mr. Vinay Bhasin, Sr. Adv. for the petitioner limited his submission\n        to the argument the reference made under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 10</a> of Industrial\n        Disputes Act in the present case was incompetent, as the appropriate\n        Government to make the said reference was not the State\n        Government but the Central Government. Mr. Salman Khurshid, Sr.\n        Adv. has advanced his arguments by way of rebuttal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        Arguments have been concluded and judgment is reserved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        After conclusion of arguments, both counsel submit, at the Bar, that\n        there may be a possibility of settlement. Renotify on 10th November,\n        2017 for the parties to report whether the dispute has been settled out\n        of the Court or not. In case settlement does not take place, judgment\n        would be pronounced, thereafter, on the basis of the arguments\n        advanced today, in the light of the record available before the Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">It was, therefore, understood, at the Bar, that no other contention was\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                               Page 3 of 38</span>\n being raised by the petitioner, and, consequently no other issue was\nanswered by the respondent. As such, I have confined my analysis\nand decision, hereinafter, to the issue of validity of the reference,\ndated 20th July 1995, by the Secretary (Labour), Govt of NCT of\nDelhi. Be it noted, in this regard, that the attempt at settlement of the\nmatter was unsuccessful, as was reported, to the court, on 10 th\nNovember 2017, thereby necessitating this judgement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1800993\" id=\"span_5\">5.      A brief overview of the factual matrix would, at this stage, be\napposite.      It is necessary, at the outset, to understand the exact\ncharacter of the petitioner (SCOPE). Fortunately, a Division Bench of\nthis Court has, in <a href=\"/doc/1800993/\" id=\"a_3\">New Delhi General Mazdoor Union v. Standing\nConference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE), ILR</a> (1992) I Del 358,\nsubjected the petitioner to a minute psychoanalysis and has, thereafter,\nexpressed its view, thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        &quot;8.    Before we refer to the relevant provisions of the Act it will be\n        appropriate to examine what the SCOPE is and how it is governed\n        and if there are any service regulations for its employees. This is\n        relevant also to see if the SCOPE is an instrumentality of the State.\n        Under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, the „State‟ under Part III\n        (Fundamental Rights) includes the Government and Parliament of\n        India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States\n        and all local or other authorities within the territory of India under\n        the control of the Government of India. As noted above, SCOPE is a\n        society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_5\">Societies Registration Act, 1860</a>. It was\n        registered on September 29, 1970 in the name &quot;New Horizon&quot;. It\n        was then rechristened in its present name (Standing Conference of\n        Public Enterprises). The basic objective of SCOPE is as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                    &quot;SCOPE looks upon its task as both internal and external to\n                    the public sector. Internally, it would endeavour to assist the\n                    public sector in such ways as would help improve its total\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                   Page 4 of 38</span>\n                     performance. Externally, it would help improve its total\n                    boundary role in conveying such information and advice to\n                    the community and the Government as would generally help\n                    the public sector in its role&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">        9.      There are other objects as well. In the booklet Memorandum\n        and Articles of Association of SCOPE there is a copy of letter dated\n        November 8, 1976 addressed by the Government of India to the\n        Chairman of SCOPE wherein it is stated that in view of the aforesaid\n        basic objective of SCOPE, Government had accorded formal\n        recognition to SCOPE. It is mentioned in this letter that Government\n        had taken note of the fact that structure of SCOPE would be as\n        indicated in <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_7\">7</a> of the Articles of Association. Then it is\n        mentioned that with regard to <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 3</a> under which SCOPE can\n        admit non-Central Government Enterprises as members, it had been\n        decided that such membership might, better be restricted to the\n        institutional/sector-wise representations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">        10.    Under <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 3</a> membership of SCOPE is open to (1) all\n        public enterprises of the Central Government, (2) State Government\n        enterprises etc. subject to approval and confirmation by the\n        Executive Board, and (3) other organisations/corporate\n        bodies/institutions again subject to approval and confirmation by the\n        Executive Board. Public enterprise in the Articles of Association\n        means a Government company or a statutory corporation owned and\n        controlled by the Central Government or State Government. SCOPE\n        has two administrative organs- Governing Council and the Executive\n        Board. Under <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 6</a>, Chief Executive of a member enterprise\n        automatically becomes the member of the Governing Council. The\n        Director General, Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) and two\n        Advisers in the Bureau not below the rank of Joint Secretaries, to be\n        nominated by the Director General, BPE, shall be ex-officio\n        members of the Governing Council with full voting rights. A\n        nominee of each State SCOPE, affiliated to SCOPE, shall also be an\n        ex-officio member of the Governing Council. It is made clear that in\n        case the Chief Executive is transferred, dies, retires or leaves his\n        post, his successor automatically becomes the member of the\n        Governing Council. Then functions of the Governing Council have\n        been prescribed. The executive authority of SCOPE vests in the\n        Executive Board whose functions are also prescribed. The Board\n        consists of 29 members. Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Director\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                Page 5 of 38</span>\n         General, B.P.E., are the ex-officio members of the Board. 19\n        members are to be elected by the Governing Council and 7 members\n        are to be co-opted as per rules. Chairman and Vice-Chairman are to\n        be elected by the Governing Council. The finances of the SCOPE are\n        provided in Article10 which is as under -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                    &quot;<a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 10</a>\n                    FINANCES\n                    The finance of the Society shall be derived from\n                    subscriptions, contributions donations, bequests, gifts, grants-\n                    in-aid, investments, loans, endowments, rents, revenue\n                    earning schemes or any other legitimate source approved by\n                    the Executive Board which is not contrary to the objects of the\n                    Society.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">        11.    Patron-in-Chief of the SCOPE is Prime Minister of India. In a\n        booklet published by SCOPE it is mentioned that &quot;New Horizon&quot;, a\n        registered society was set up in New Delhi on September 29, 1970\n        with the basic objective of promoting &quot;better understanding among\n        the public about the individual and collective contribution of public\n        sector&quot;. Gradually the amorphous concepts began to take shape. The\n        objectives were widened and &quot;New Horizon&quot; was rechristened as\n        SCOPE which assumed the role and contours of an apex body of\n        Central Public Sector Enterprises on April 10, 1973. It was given\n        formal recognition by the Government of India on November 8, 1976\n        by a decision of the Union Cabinet. It is also stated that SCOPE was\n        created by a decision of the Cabinet presided over by the Prime\n        Minister and that it is an apex body of Public Sector Enterprises\n        numbering about 214 with a total investment of nearly about Rs.\n        40,000 crores and employing about 20 lakhs people. In the form of\n        application for membership of SCOPE one has to specify if the\n        applicant is (1) a Government of India enterprise, (2) a State Govt.\n        enterprise, or (3) any other. The annual subscription for membership\n        is prescribed as Rs. 30,000 for Schedule „A‟ Company, Rs. 20,000\n        for Schedule „B‟ Company and Rs. 10.000 for Schedule „C‟ and „D‟\n        Company. We have been told that this categorisation of companies is\n        of public enterprises guided by the B.P.E., a department of the\n        Central Government in the Ministry of Finance/Industry. The\n        application form does not show the annual membership fee of a\n        company outside these four categories which apply to Government\n        companies. We are further told that the Chief Executive in Schedule\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                    Page 6 of 38</span>\n         „A‟ public enterprise gets a pay in the pay-scale of Rs. 4,500-125-\n        5,000, that in. Schedule ‟B‟ Rs. 4,000-125-4,500, Schedule „C‟ Rs.\n        3,500-100-4,000 and Schedule „D‟ Rs. 3,000-100-3,700. At our\n        instance SCOPE filed a list of members. They number 196 and all of\n        them are Public Sector Undertakings. The building complex of\n        SCOPE at Lodhi Road was built with contributions of various Public\n        Sector Undertakings who have been provided space therein. They are\n        paying service charges as well to the SCOPE for amenities who in\n        turn has also utilised the services of contract labour for various job\n        requirements for the purpose. There is no private party who is either\n        a member of the SCOPE or has got any space in the building\n        complex. All funding of SCOPE is done by various Public Sector\n        Undertakings and not even a penny has been received from any\n        outside agency, either by way of gift, bequest, donation, etc.\n        Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the SCOPE have always been the\n        Chief Executive of various Public Sector Undertakings. It, therefore,\n        does appear to us that though if reference is made to the\n        Memorandum and Articles of Association of the SCOPE, one may\n        get the impression that SCOPE is neither an agency nor\n        instrumentality of State so as to come within the purview of &quot;other\n        authorities&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. But then, as the facts\n        show, SCOPE is wearing a mask obviously to show that it is outside\n        the control of the Central Government but no effort is needed to tear\n        open that mask. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1281050\" id=\"span_9\">An argument was raised that funding had to be done\n        by the Government to make SCOPE an instrumentality of State and\n        not that when funding is done by a public sector enterprise who in\n        turn may be getting funded by the Government. This argument is just\n        taken to be rejected. The colour of money does not change by\n        adopting such a method. Reference was made to four decisions of the\n        Supreme Court - (<a href=\"/doc/1281050/\" id=\"a_13\">1) Ramanna D. Shetty v.

The criteria evolved was applied by the Court in Ajay\n        Hasia&#x27;s and Tekraj Vasandi&#x27;s (ICPS) cases. After examining these\n        decisions we are clear in our opinion that our answer should be in the\n        affirmative to hold that SCOPE is an &quot;authority&quot; falling within the\n        definition of „State‟ in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. We have no\n        doubt that it is the Central Government which controls the strings in\n        the case of SCOPE. We may also note that in the service rules of\n        SCOPE there is a provision for deputation of officers from Central/\n        State Governments and other public sector undertakings. These\n        officers can thereafter be absorbed in SCOPE. Services of an\n        employee of SCOPE can also be lent to the Government or any\n        authority subordinate thereto or to any other public undertaking.\n        Further, where an order of suspension is made or disciplinary\n        proceeding is taken against an employee who is on deputation to\n        SCOPE from the Central or State Government or any other public\n        undertaking or a local authority, the authority lending his services is\n        to be informed of the circumstances leading to the order of\n        suspension or the commencement of disciplinary proceedings, as the\n        case may be. An employee of SCOPE is liable to be transferred on\n        deputation/foreign service to any department of the Government or\n        any of the public sector undertaking anywhere in India or abroad. It\n        is difficult to find these service conditions in a private organisation.\n        These conditions show the nexus of SCOPE with the Government.\n        About finances coming from the government agencies,\n        notwithstanding <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 10</a> have already been noted above and\n        influence of Government on SCOPE, through the B.P.E., a\n        department of the Central Government, we find is all pervasive.

Mr. Bhasin, understandably, strongly relies on the observation,\nin para 12 of the report in <a href=\"/doc/1800993/\" id=\"a_20\">New Delhi General Mazdoor Union</a> (supra,\nto the effect that &quot;it is the Central Government which control the\nstrings in the case of SCOPE&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">7.      Reconnoitring, now, the facts.    On 22nd February 1989, the\npetitioner wrote to the Directorate General Re-settlement (DGR),\nMinistry of Defence, Government of India, stating that it had\nconstructed a multi-storied office complex at Lodhi Road for\naccommodating 28 leading public sector undertakings, and was\nrequired to provide security services for the said premises. The letter\nfurther stated that the petitioner had, till then, been negotiating\nagencies for such service by open competition, but had been advised,\nby its management, to &quot;derive such services&quot; through agencies\nrecommended by the DGR. Accordingly, the DGR was requested to\nrecommend four to six agencies, who could be considered for\nproviding such services.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">8.      The DGR responded vide a letter dated 03rd March 1989,\naddressed to the petitioner, wherein it was clarified that the companies\nsponsored by the DGR entered into bilateral agreements with it and\nthat, in practice, it used to nominate only one agency, after negotiating\nemoluments with the public sector undertaking in question.\nNomination of more than one agency, it was stated, would neutralize\nthe object for which the DGR was established, which was to stop\nexploitation of, and rehabilitate, ex-servicemen.      Finally, the said\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                          Page 9 of 38</span>\n communication stated that, in response to the requisition by the\npetitioner, the DGR was nominating M/s. Great Ex-servicemen\nSecurity Transport Service (P) Ltd.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">9.      It appears that, thereafter, the petitioner wrote, to the DGR, on\n4th August 1989, in response whereto the DGR wrote, to the petitioner,\non 10th August 1989, nominating the DGSS in addition to M/s. Great\nEx-servicemen Security Transport Services (P) Ltd.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">10.     Following thereupon, on 28th September 1989, the petitioner\ninvited quotations, from M/s.

In response to the said communication, bids were received from\nM/s. Great Ex-servicemen Security Transport Services (P) Ltd. and\nDGSS, and were put up before a committee constituted by the\npetitioner, which, vide minutes dated 25th October 1989, approved the\nbid of DGSS.            On the basis of such approval, the contract for\nproviding security services at the SCOPE building was awarded, by\nthe petitioner, to DGSS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">12.     Invoices issued by DGSS, and receipts of payments made by the\npetitioner thereagainst, have also been placed on record by the\npetitioner.         It is seen that the invoices raised by DGSS on the\npetitioner set out the particulars of the Security Personnel provided by\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                          Page 10 of 38</span>\n it, with accompanying rates, and that payment, against such invoices,\nwere made by the petitioner to DGSS, against payment vouchers. The\npetitioner also placed, on record, attendance registers in respect of the\nSecurity Personnel, which were also maintained by DGSS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">13.     Five writ petitions, one by the New Delhi General Mazdoor\nUnion and the remaining four by the Delhi Officers and Establishment\nEmployees Union, were filed before this Court, against the petitioner\nherein, avowedly espousing the cause of workmen who had been\nengaged, by the petitioner, through contractors such as the DGSS.\nThe specific case, canvassed by the petitioner-Unions in the said writ\npetitions, turned on the fact that the petitioner herein i.e. SCOPE, was\nnot registered under <a href=\"/doc/1150040/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 7</a> and the contractors (including DGSS),\nthrough whom services were requisitioned by the petitioner, were not\nlicensed under <a href=\"/doc/476610/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12</a> of the Contract Labour (Regularisation and\nAbolition) Act, 1970 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;CLRAA&quot;, for the\nsake of convenience).      The consequence of this default, in the\nsubmission of the petitioner-Unions, was that the workmen were\nentitled to be treated as direct employees of SCOPE i.e. the petitioner\nherein. It is not necessary to enter into the particulars of the said\njudgement; suffice it to state that the said issue was answered, by this\nCourt, in the negative, i.e. in favour of SCOPE and against the\npetitioner-Unions, holding that non-registration of SCOPE under\n<a href=\"/doc/1150040/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 7</a>, and non-licensing of the contractors, under <a href=\"/doc/1570927/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 12</a>, of\nthe CLRAA, would not result ipso facto in the workmen becoming\ndirect employees of SCOPE.

As the issues involved in\nthe appeals before it were common, the Supreme Court treated Civil\nAppeal 5497/1995 as the lead case, and returned detailed findings, on\nthe questions arising before it, in para 53 of the report, which reads as\nunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">         &quot;53. Our conclusions and answers to the questions raised are,\n         therefore, as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                    (i)    In view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 10</a> of the Act, it is\n                    only the appropriate Government which has the authority to\n                    abolish genuine labour contract in accordance with the\n                    provisions of the said section. No court including the\n                    industrial adjudicator has jurisdiction to do so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                    (ii)   If the contract is a sham or not genuine, the workmen\n                    of the so-called contractor can raise an industrial dispute for\n                    declaring that they were always the employees of the principal\n                    employer and for claiming the appropriate service conditions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">                    When such dispute is raised, it is not a dispute for abolition of\n                    the labour contract and hence the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 10</a> of\n                    the Act will not bar either the raising or the adjudication of\n                    the dispute. When such dispute is raised, the industrial\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                     Page 12 of 38</span>\n                     adjudicator has to decide whether the contract is a sham or\n                    genuine. It is only if the adjudicator comes to the conclusion\n                    that the contract is a sham, that he will have jurisdiction to\n                    adjudicate the dispute. If, however, he comes to the\n                    conclusion that the contract is genuine, he may refer the\n                    workmen to the appropriate Government for abolition of the\n                    contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 10</a> of the Act and keep the\n                    dispute pending. However, he can do so if the dispute is\n                    espoused by the direct workmen of the principal employer. If\n                    the workmen of the principal employer have not espoused the\n                    dispute, the adjudicator, after coming to the conclusion that\n                    the contract is genuine, has to reject the reference, the dispute\n                    being not an industrial dispute within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n                    2(k)</a> of the ID Act.

However, the dispute will have to be\n                    raised invariably by the direct employees of the principal\n                    employer. The industrial adjudicator, after receipt of the\n                    reference of such dispute will have first to direct the workmen\n                    to approach the appropriate Government for abolition of the\n                    contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 10</a> of the Act and keep the\n                    reference pending. If pursuant to such reference, the contract\n                    labour is abolished by the appropriate Government, the\n                    industrial adjudicator will have to give opportunity to the\n                    parties to place the necessary material before him to decide\n                    whether the workmen of the erstwhile contractor should be\n                    directed to be absorbed by the principal employer, how many\n                    of them and on what terms. If, however, the contract labour is\n                    not abolished, the industrial adjudicator has to reject the\n                    reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">                    (iv) Even after the contract labour system is abolished, the\n                    direct employees of the principal employer can raise an\n                    industrial dispute for absorption of the ex-contractor‟s\n                    workmen and the adjudicator on the material placed before\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                     Page 13 of 38</span>\n                     him can decide as to who and how many of the workmen\n                    should be absorbed and on what terms.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">15.

The remedy of the workmen is to raise a proper industrial\n        dispute as indicated earlier for appropriate reliefs.

Civil appeals are therefore dismissed but with no order as to\n        costs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">16.

The work of handling goods in stockyards of the Steel\nAuthority of India Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;SAIL&quot;) was, in that\ncase, entrusted to contractors.

The very first question framed by the Supreme Court for its\nconsideration, as set out in para 6 of the report, read thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">        &quot;What is the true and correct import of the expression „appropriate\n        Government‟ as defined in clause (A) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1817848/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 2</a>\n        of the CLRA Act?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">24.

Alternatives (a) and (c) indicate cases of any\n        industry carried on directly by the Central Government or a railway\n        company. They are too clear to admit of any polemic.

The word is frequently\n        used to express derivative power; and in this sense, the word may be\n        used as meaning instructions, permission, power delegated by one\n        person to another, the result of the manifestations by the former to\n        the latter of the former&#x27;s consent that the latter shall act for him,\n        authority in this sense -- in the laws of at least one State, it has been\n        similarly used as designating or meaning an agency for the purpose\n        of carrying out a State duty or function; someone to whom by law a\n        power has been given. In Words and Phrases we find various shades\n        of meaning of the word &quot;authority&quot; at pp. 603, 606, 612 and 613:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">        authority, as the word is used throughout the restatement, is the\n        power of one person to affect the legal relations of another by acts\n        done in accordance with the other&#x27;s manifestations of consent to him;\n        an agency of one or more participating governmental units created\n        by statute for specific purpose of having delegated to it certain\n        functions which are governmental in character; the lawful delegation\n        of power by one person to another; power of agent to affect legal\n        relations of principal by acts done in accordance with principal&#x27;s\n        manifestations of consent to him.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">        30.

A hypothetical example, cited by the Supreme\nCourt in para 38 of the report, while explaining this distinction, is\nimportant, in the context of the present controversy, and para 38 may,\ntherefore, be reproduced, to advantage, thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">        &quot;From the above discussion, it follows that the fact of being an\n        instrumentality of a Central/State Government or being &quot;State&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">        within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution cannot be\n        determinative of the question as to whether an industry carried on by\n        a company/corporation or an instrumentality of the Government is by\n        or under the authority of the Central Government for the purpose of\n        or within the meaning of the definition of &quot;appropriate Government&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">        in the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_75\">CLRA Act</a>. Take the case of a State Government\n        corporation/company/undertaking set up and owned by the State\n        Government which is an instrumentality or agency of the State\n        Government and is engaged in carrying on an industry, can it be\n        assumed that the industry is carried on under the authority of the\n        Central Government, and in relation to any industrial dispute\n        concerning the industry, can it be said that the appropriate\n        Government is the Central Government? We think the answer must\n        be in the negative. In the above example, if, as a fact, any industry is\n        carried on by the State Government undertaking under the authority\n        of the Central Government, then in relation to any industrial dispute\n        concerning that industry, the appropriate Government will be the\n        Central Government.

In our view, the same reasoning applies to a Central\n        Government undertaking as well. Further, the definition of\n        &quot;establishment&quot; in the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_76\">CLRA Act</a> takes in its fold purely private\n        undertakings which cannot be brought within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_77\">Article\n        12</a> of the Constitution. In such a case, how is &quot;appropriate\n        Government&quot; determined for the purposes of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_78\">CLRA Act</a> or the\n        <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_79\">Industrial Disputes Act</a>? In our view, the test which is determinative\n        is: whether the industry carried on by the establishment in question is\n        under the authority of the Central Government. Obviously, there\n        cannot be one test for one part of the definition of &quot;establishment&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">        and another test for another part. Thus, it is clear that the criterion is\n        whether an undertaking/instrumentality of the Government is\n        carrying on an industry under the authority of the Central\n        Government and not whether the undertaking is an instrumentality or\n        agency of the Government for purposes of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 12</a> of the\n        Constitution, be it of the Central Government or the State\n        Government.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">                                                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">27.

We have held\n        above that being the instrumentality or agency of the Central\n        Government would not by itself amount to having the authority of\n        the Central Government to carry on that particular industry.\n        Therefore, it will be incorrect to say that in relation to any\n        establishment of a Central Government company/undertaking, the\n        appropriate Government will be the Central Government. To hold\n        that the Central Government is &quot;the appropriate Government&quot; in\n        relation to an establishment, the court must be satisfied that the\n        particular industry in question is carried on by or under the\n        authority of the Central Government. If this aspect is kept in mind it\n        would be clear that the Central Government will be the &quot;appropriate\n        Government&quot; under the CLRA Act and the ID Act provided the\n        industry in question is carried on by a Central Government\n        company/an undertaking under the authority of the Central\n        Government. Such an authority may be conferred, either by a statute\n        or by virtue of the relationship of principal and agent or delegation\n        of power. Where the authority, to carry on any industry for or on\n        behalf of the Central Government, is conferred on the government\n        company/any undertaking by the statute under which it is created, no\n        further question arises. But, if it is not so, the question that arises is\n        whether there is any conferment of authority on the government\n        company/any undertaking by the Central Government to carry on the\n        industry in question.

Clearly, therefore, the petitioner functions under the control of\nthe Central Government, and more significantly, has been empowered\nand permitted to do so by the Central Government, as the above\nevidence amply discloses. The petitioner is, therefore, liable to be\nregarded as functioning &quot;by or under the authority of&quot; the Central\nGovernment. I am, therefore, in agreement with the judgment, of Shiv\nNarayan Dhingra, J., speaking for this Court, in <a href=\"/doc/1309191/\" id=\"a_92\">Standing Conference\nof Public Enterprises v Government of NCT of Delhi</a>, 2007 (93) DRJ\n616, to the extent that the Central Government would qualify to be\nregarded as the &quot;appropriate Government&quot;, to refer an industrial\ndispute under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 10</a> of the ID Act. The said decision also relies,\nfor this conclusion, on a letter, dated 11th February 2000, from the\nMinistry of Labour, Government of India categorically stating that the\n&quot;appropriate Government in respect of the petitioner under Contract\nLabour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, and ID Act, was the Central\nGovernment&quot;.

Though there is considerable ambivalence of judicial thought\nwhich could influence the decision on this issue, in the ultimate\neventuate, the answer, has, inevitably in my opinion, to be in the\nnegative. The reason, simply put, is to be found in Clause (f) of Rule\n2 of the Industrial Disputes (Central) Rules, 1957 (hereinafter referred\nto as &quot;the ID Rules&quot;), and the evolution of law thereon, to which I\nshall presently advert.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">34.

The opening words of Clause (f) of Rule 2 of the ID Rules make\nit clear that the said clause applies only to industrial disputes (i) which\narise in Union Territories, and (ii) in respect of which, under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_96\">ID\nAct</a>, the &quot;appropriate Government&quot; is the Central Government.

The industrial dispute, in the\npresent case, undoubtedly arose within the Union Territory of Delhi,\nand the discussion hereinabove also clarifies that the &quot;appropriate\nGovernment&quot;, for the purposes thereof, is the Central Government.\nBoth ingredients of clause (f) of Rule 2 of the ID Rules, thereby, stand\nsatisfied.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">36.     There is wealth of judicial authority to the effect that, by virtue\nof clause (f) of Rule 2 of the ID Rules, in the case of industrial\ndisputes arising within Union Territories, the Administrator of the\nconcerned Union Territory is competent to make the reference to the\nLabour Court or Industrial Tribunal, under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 10</a> of the ID Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                  Page 30 of 38</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\"> A glance, thereat, would be apposite.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">37.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1507353\" id=\"span_53\">In <a href=\"/doc/1507353/\" id=\"a_99\">Goa Sampling Employees&#x27; Association v General\nSuperintendence Co. of India</a>, (1985) 1 SCC 206, a dispute, raised by\nthe Goa Sampling Employees‟ Association was referred, by the\nCentral Government, to the Industrial Tribunal.        A preliminary\nobjection, to the effect that the Central Government was incompetent\nto make the reference, was taken. The Supreme Court held that the\nAdministrator of the Union Territory could not be regarded as the\n&quot;State Government&quot;.     Relying on <a href=\"/doc/178208476/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 3 (60)</a> of the General\nClauses Act, 1897, it was further held that the said clause &quot;upon its\ntrue construction would show that in the Union Territory, there is no\nconcept of State Government but wherever the expression „State\nGovernment‟ is used in relation to the Union Territory, the Central\nGovernment would be the State Government&quot; and that &quot;the very\nconcept of State Government in relation to Union Territory is\nobliterated by the definition&quot;. The said decision having been rendered\nprior to the enactment of <a href=\"/doc/78006484/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 239AA</a> in the Constitution, it went on\nto hold that &quot;the concept of State Government is foreign to the\nadministration of Union Territories and <a href=\"/doc/297117/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 239</a> provides that the\nUnion Territory is to be administered by the President&quot;.

Consequent to his termination, the said gardener\nraised an industrial dispute, contending that he had been illegally\nretrenched. The matter was referred to the Labour Court, by the Delhi\nAdministration, and award was rendered thereon. In the challenge\nthereto, the learned Single Judge of this Court, relying on clause (f) in\nRule 2 of the ID Rules, held the reference itself to be without\njurisdiction, as the Delhi Administration did not possess the requisite\npower to refer the industrial dispute for adjudication. Taking into\nstock the provision contained in the said clause, the Division Bench, in\nappeal, noticed that the power, thereunder, which could be exercised\nby the Central Government, stood delegated to the Lt.

This decision, therefore, holds, in unambiguous terms, that the\nLt.

I may mention, here, that, in response to the reliance, placed by\nMr. Salman Khurshid, on this decision, Mr. Vinay Bhasin sought to\ndraw my attention to para 6 thereof. However, on a reading of the said\npara, I am of the opinion that it does not advance the case of the\npetitioner, or impede that of the respondent. The said para merely\nrefers to the contention, of the Management of the MCD<a href=\"/doc/161886172/\" id=\"a_113\">, <a href=\"/doc/161886172/\" id=\"a_114\">in that case</a></a>,\nthat &quot;having regard to the nature of business carried out by the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                              Page 33 of 38</span>\n petitioner the Central Government is the appropriate Government&quot;.\nThere is no dispute that, under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_115\">ID Act</a>, the Central Government is\nthe &quot;appropriate Government&quot;, in the present case; indeed, this is a\nsine qua non for clause (f) of Rule 2 of the ID Rules to apply, as has\nalready been noticed hereinabove.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"285258\" id=\"span_62\">The reliance, by Mr. Salman\nKhurshid, on <a href=\"/doc/285258/\" id=\"a_116\">Mahavir</a> (supra) is, therefore, well-taken.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"285258\" id=\"span_63\">43.     <a href=\"/doc/285258/\" id=\"a_117\">Mahavir</a> (supra), and the law laid down therein, has guided\nlater decisions.</span> In Apparel Export Promotion Council v Presiding\nOfficer, 2002 (3) LLN 34 (Del), Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. (as he then\nwas) quoted, approvingly, the ratio of an earlier decision of this Court\nin National Building Construction Corporation Ltd v M. K. Jain,\n1981 Lab IC 62 - in a case in which the reference had been made, to\nthe Labour Court, by the State Government, and, as in the present\ncase, it was sought to be contended that the reference was\nincompetent, as it had to be made by the Central Government - to the\neffect that &quot;no exception could be taken to the order of reference, even\nif it be assumed that Central Government was the appropriate\nGovernment, inasmuch as the distinction between the Central and the\nState Governments in relation to the Union Territory in our\nconstitutional framework is rendered illusory&quot;.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1507353\" id=\"span_64\"><a href=\"/doc/1507353/\" id=\"a_118\">Goa Sampling</a>\n(supra), it may be noted, was also taken into account, while rendering\n<a href=\"/doc/1507353/\" id=\"a_119\">the said decision</a>, and it was observed, in this regard, that &quot;the same\nwas concerned with the distinction between the powers of the\nAdministrator in the Union Territory of Delhi to that of a Governor in\na State and the same would thus be applicable only in respect of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                         Page 34 of 38</span>\n said issue since the effect of Rule 2(f) of the Rules was not in issue.&quot;\nThis distinction, in my respectful opinion, appears entirely apt, and I\nexpress my complete concurrence therewith.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1800993\" id=\"span_66\">It may also be noted, in\npassing, that this decision, of Kaul, J. (as he then was), in Apparel\nExport Promotion Council (supra) was one of the decisions which\nwere affirmed, in appeal, by the judgement of the Division Bench of\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1800993/\" id=\"a_120\">New Delhi General Mazdoor Union</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1716903\" id=\"span_67\">44.     Another learned Single Judge of this Court echoed the same\nsentiment in <a href=\"/doc/1716903/\" id=\"a_121\">Kanhaiya Lal v. UOI</a>, 2007 (2) LLJ 1022 (Del). In that\ncase, too, an industrial dispute, raised by an employee of the Rajghaat\nSamadhi Committee, which functioned under the authority of the\nCentral Government, was referred to by the Secretary (Labour),\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi, to the Labour Court. It was contended,\nby the Management, that the reference was invalid, as the Central\nGovernment alone was competent to make it. Accepting the said\nproposition, the Labour Court declined to return any decision on\nmerits. This Court, speaking through Rekha Sharma, J., after\nextracting Clause (f) of Rule 2 of the ID Rules, proceeded to hold\nthus:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">        &quot;It is clear from the above rule that if an industrial dispute for which\n        the appropriate Government is the Central Government has arisen in\n        a Union Territory, reference to the Central Government or\n        Government of India shall be read as reference to the Administrator\n        of the territory while reference to the Chief Labour Commissioner\n        (Central), Regional Labour Commissioner (Central) and Assistant\n        Labour Commissioner (Central) shall be read as reference to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                                Page 35 of 38</span>\n         appropriate Government appointed in this behalf by the\n        Administrator of the Territory. Therefore, to say, that the Secretary\n        (Labour), Government of NCT, Delhi, was not competent to refer the\n        dispute would be ignoring the statutory provision&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"776776\" id=\"span_69\">45.     A similar dispute arose before Swatanter Kumar, J. (as he then\nwas), sitting singly, in <a href=\"/doc/776776/\" id=\"a_122\">Sports Authority of India v. Sports Authority\nKaamgar Union</a>. In that case, too, reference, under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 10</a> of the\nID Act, as made by the Government of NCT of Delhi, was alleged to\nbe incompetent, the Sports Authority of India being a body under the\ncontrol of the Central Government.           This Court rejected the said\nsubmission holding thus:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045600\" id=\"span_70\">&quot;8. Lastly, it was contended that Sports Authority of India is a body\n        under the control of Central Government and as such Government of\n        Delhi had no jurisdiction to make a reference. The appropriate\n        Government which could exercise the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/760439/\" id=\"a_124\">Section\n        10(1)(e)</a> of the Act, was the Central Government. It has already been\n        discussed that the petitioner authority is an industry and is under the\n        control of the Union. Full Bench of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1045600/\" id=\"a_125\">Indian\n        Tourism Development Corporation, New Delhi Vs. Delhi\n        Administration and Ors.</a>, 1982 (61) FJR 139, clearly enunciated the\n        principle that Lt. Governor or Administration of Union Territory of\n        Delhi would discharge functions and powers of the State\n        Government under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_126\">Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</a> and powers of\n        the kind to make reference stood delegated to the State Government\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1022486/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 39</a> of the Notification.</span> Even earlier to this, this view\n        was followed by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of M/s.\n        Lila Separator Pvt. Ltd. Vs. The Secretary (Labour), Delhi\n        Administration, and Ors., 1981 (43) FLR 170. Reference can also\n        be made to the judgment of this Court in the case of Apparel Export\n        Promotion Council Vs. Presiding Officer, Industrial Tribunal No.1\n        and Ors., 2002 (3) LLJ 511.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">        9. In view of the above considered view of this Court and the larger\n        Bench which is binding upon me, I have no hesitation in rejecting the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.P.(C) 5830/2004                                               Page 36 of 38</span>\n         contention raised on behalf of the petitioner in regard to the\n        invalidity of the reference on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of\n        Delhi Administration to make such a reference. For the reasons\n        aforestated I find no merit in this petition, the same is dismissed.\n        However, the parties are left to bear their own costs&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">46.     In the light of the cornucopia of case law cited hereinabove, it is\nnot possible, for me, to accept the submission of Mr. Vinay Bhasin,\nlearned senior counsel, that the reference dated 20th July 1995, made\nin the present case by the Secretary (Labour), Government of NCT of\nDelhi, was incompetent and sans jurisdiction. No doubt, the judgment\nof Dhingra, J. in Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (supra)\nsupports the stand of Mr. Bhasin. However, the said decision does not\ntake into account Rule 2 (f) of the ID Rules, which makes all the\ndifference, as was significantly noted in Apparel Export Promotion\nCouncil (supra). The wealth of judicial authority that exists, based on\nthe said clause, compels me to accept the stand advanced by Mr.\nSalman Khurshid that the reference, in the present case, was indeed\ncompetent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">47.     In view of the fact that Mr. Vinay Bhasin did not seek to urge\nany submission on merits, and Mr. Salman Khurshid, too,\nconsequently, addressed no submission on merits by way of rebuttal\neither, it would not be proper for me to return any finding on the\nmerits of the impugned award dated 16th February 1996 and order\ndated 2nd December 2003.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">48.
