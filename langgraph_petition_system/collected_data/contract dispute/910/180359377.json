The said sum\n\n                 was payable, only if the claimant meets all the criteria provided under the Contract\n\n                 and the R.A.

Hence, it is his contention that\n\n                 operation of the plant includes producing quality water. Even if the plant was to\n\n                 run more than 650 hours and the quantity is in variance with the guaranteed\n\n                 parameters, those hours would not be considered for the purpose of operation of\n\n                 the desalination plant. Hence, it is his contention that if the hours in which the\n\n                 desalination plant was running while deficient producing water, it has to be\n\n                 construed as the desalination plant in operation and it would be unreasonable and\n\n                 contrary to the express terms of the contract and above view of the arbitrator is not\n\n                 even possible.

Therefore, the learned\n\n                 arbitrator having held that the defective water is not attributable to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_6\">CPC</a>L and\n\n                 found that the IEIL has established that it has incurred a sum of Rs.1,25,00,000/-\n\n                 loss per month on account of the shortfall in the quality or quantity of water.\n\n                 However, the arbitrator has erroneously rejected the contention of the respondent\n\n                 that even if the claimant operated the desalination plant for a period of 650 hours\n\n                 per month with inferior quality product water, liquidated damages could be levied.\n\n                 Such interpretation is contrary to the express terms of the contract.

It is the further contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that\n\n                 the learned arbitrator awarding interest from the date of the statement of claim is\n\n                 erroneous. As far a disallowing claim No.5, it is submitted that the arbitrator has\n\n                 in fact has factually recorded a finding that no production was done due to the\n\n                 strike by the workmen during installation and commissioning of the desalination\n\n                 plant by the claimant. The above claim was made as a strike by workmen as force\n\n                 majeure event. Now, before this Court, the contention of the claimant is that it\n\n                 does not come under the force majeure clause and the same is contrary to their\n\n                 pleadings and submissions before the learned arbitrator. At any event, the learned\n\n                 arbitrator has considered the entire aspects and rejected the claim. Therefore,\n\n                 claiming such an amount by the claimant is not maintainable in the eye of law.\n\n                 With regard to the claim No.7, the learned arbitrator has factually deducted the\n\n                 damages for quantity and quality of water for particular months.                 The above\n\n                 findings is based on the factual findings of the learned arbitrator and the same\n\n                 cannot be interfered. Hence, it is his contention that the awarding pendentilie\n\n                 interest is also not as per law and against the contractual terms.

Clause 66.2 states\n\n                 that no penalty shall be levied if the plant is in operation for a minimum period of\n\n                 650 hours and produces more than 2,00,000 metric ton per month. As per 66.3, if\n\n                 the plant for reasons attributable to the contractor does not operate for a minimum\n\n                 period of 650 hours per month, but produces more than 2,00,000 metric ton,\n\n                 penalty shall be limited to 15% of the monthly payable lump sum amount. It is his\n\n                 further contention that there is no deviation of operation in the contract. Change in\n\n                 the deviation suggested by the claimant was not accepted by the respondent is not\n\n                 acceptable. Hence, it is his contention that the operation must be taken into\n\n                 consideration to interpret the contract. The learned arbitrator has taken note of the\n\n                 above facts and interpreted the contract reasonably. Hence, it is his contention that\n\n                 the construction of the terms of contract, it is for the arbitrator to decide. The\n\n                 Courts cannot interfere unless the arbitrator has considered the contract beyond\n\n                 the terms of the contract. Hence, it is his contention that the tribunal has applied\n\n                 clause 66.2 to the facts and upheld quality penalty for one month and quantity\n\n                 penalty for another month.

Clause 9 deals with pre arbitration interest and pre arbitration claim.\n\n                 Whereas the Special Conditions of the Contract in Clause 45 deals with interest\n\n                 and states that Interest, if awarded by the arbitrator, shall be at a rate not\n\n                 exceeding the cash credit prevailing on the date of the award. Hence, it is his\n\n                 contention that the clause 45 of Special Conditions of the contract empowers the\n\n                 arbitrator to award interest. The arbitral Tribunal interpreted clause 45 and clause\n\n                 9.3.5 harmoniously and held that clause 9.3.5 prohibits the awarding of pre-\n\n                 arbitration interest and clause 45 permits pendentelite interest.              Hence, the\n\n                 reasoning of the learned arbitrator is possible and reasonable and therefore, it\n\n                 cannot be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                          14.

Further, the tribunal has not taken note of\n\n                 the above facts. Hence, it is his contention that rejecting claim for July 2012 and\n\n                 January 2011 has to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">                          15. It is the further contention of the learned Senior Counsel that the arbitral\n\n                 tribunal dismissed the claim No.9 on the ground that since the labourers created\n\n                 problem and went on strike, the same lead to shut down of the plant and this\n\n                 amounts to force majeure events and therefore, the arbitrator has held that the\n\n                 contractor is relieved of payments. It is his contention that the interpretation of the\n\n                 arbitrator is not reasonable and plausible and will not fall under Clause 7.8.1.\n\n                 Clause 7.4 deals with the extension of time or relieve the contractor of his full\n\n                 obligation under the contract. Clause 7.4.6 not restricted to extension of time\n\n                 alone.

In such view of the matter, this Court is of the view that mere\n\n                 different interpretation is possible, the same cannot be a ground to bring the award\n\n                 within the ambit of perversity. Such an interpretation by the arbitrator is plausible\n\n                 taking note of all the facts of the case.

Therefore, this Court is\n\n                 of the view that when the terms of the contract particularly bars interest, awarding\n\n                 pendentilite interest by the arbitrator is nothing but perverse.
