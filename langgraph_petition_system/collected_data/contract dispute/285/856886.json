After  the  disputes had arisen between the  parties  under  Agreement No.CEDZ/19 of 80-81 relating to the provision of married accommodation  for 55  officers at Delhi Cantt, the matter was referred to the arbitration  of Shri P.Anatharam, Chief Engineer. The Arbitrator after hearing the  parties and  examining and considering the material before him made  and  published his  award  on 16th August, 1986. The award was filed in  court  and  after notice of filing of the award was served upon the parties the respondent  - Union  of India filed its objections under <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 30</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_2\">33</a> of the  Arbitration  Act against the award. The objections can be summarised under  the following heads: \n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      1.   That  after the signing and acceptance of the final bill  by the  contractor  and  the payment having been  made  to  the contractor  in full satisfaction of its claim there did  not arise  any  dispute between the parties which could  be  referred  to  the arbitrator and consequently  the  award  was without jurisdiction. \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      2.   That there was no evidence before the arbitrator to substantiate  the claims of the contractor regarding  reimbursement of escalation in wages of labour and increase in the cost of  building  material  and  consequently the  decision  of  the arbitrator was entirely beyond the scope of the terms of the contract;and  \n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      3.   Since there was no provision in the contract for payment  of interest the arbitrator could not award interest. \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"209845\" id=\"span_1\">2.   Ms.Jyoti  Singh learned counsel appearing on behalf of the  respondent arguing on the first point contended that the contractor having signed  the final  bill and having received payment in full satisfaction of  its  claim could not later on raise a dispute. She has placed reliance upon the  judgments reported as Nathani Steels Limited Vs. Associated Constructions, 1995 Supp(3)  SCC 324, M/s <a href=\"/doc/209845/\" id=\"a_3\">P.K.Ramaiah &amp; Co. Vs. Chairman &amp;  Managing  Director, National Thermal Power Corporation</a>, 1994 (1) SCALE 1, State of  Maharashtra Vs.  Navbharat and State of Maharashtra Vs.Nav Bharat Builders,  1994  Supp (3)  83 in support of her contention that once there was a full  and  final settlement  in respect of any particular dispute or difference in  relation to  a matter covered under the arbitration clause in the contract and  that dispute or difference is finally settled by and between the parties, such a dispute  or  difference does not remain to be dispute and  the  arbitration clause  could  not  be invoked even though for certain  other  matters  the contract  may be in subsistence. Once the parties had arrived at a  settlement  in respect of any dispute or difference arising under a contract  and that dispute or difference is amicably settled by way of a final settlement for and between the parties, unless that settlement was set aside in proper proceedings  it  could not lie in the mouth of one of the  parties  to  the settlement  to spurn it on the ground that it was a mistake and to  proceed to invoke the arbitration clause. If this was permitted the sanctity of the contract, the settlement also being a contract, would be wholly lost and it would  be  open to one party to take the benefit under the  settlement  and then question the same on the ground of mistake without having the  settlement set aside.</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\"> 3.   In  all the judgments referred to by the learned counsel for  the  respondent the court was concerned with the question as to whether a  dispute which has already been settled between the parties could at all be referred to  an arbitrator and whether the contractor was justified in invoking  the arbitration  clause. In my view, none of these judgments are applicable  to the facts and circumstances of the present case inasmuch as the  contractor had signed the final bill which was prepared by the Union of India and  had received  payment  only  thereunder. It is nowhere mentioned  that  on  the payment  of  this final bill there did not remain any dispute  between  the parties  or  all their disputes which had existed between the  parties  had been  amicably settled. Moreover, it is stated in the reply that  not  only that the petitioner had signed the final bill under duress and coercion  as the respondent was not making payment unless the petitioner had signed  the same  but  the matter having already been referred to the  arbitrator,  the respondent  cannot  now  make a grievance about the  same.  The  respondent participated  and submitted to the jurisdiction of the  arbitrator  without any  demur  and did not raise any objection to the matter having  been  referred  to the arbitrator. No objection at any time was raised by  the  respondent before the arbitrator that the matter having already been settled, the  arbitrator did not have the jurisdiction to enter upon the  reference. The award having gone against the respondent, in my view, it is too late  a stage  to agitate this question that the matter had been  amicably  settled between  the parties. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1311958\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/1311958/\" id=\"a_4\">Prasun Roy Vs. Calcutta  Metropolitan  Development Authority &amp; Another</a>,  it was held by the Supreme Court that:</span> \n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      &quot;Where though a party is aware from the beginning that by  reason of  some  disability  the matter is legally  incapable  of  being submitted to arbitration, participates in arbitration proceedings without  protest and fully avails of the entire arbitration  proceedings  and then when he sees that the award has  gone  against him  comes  forward  to challenge the whole  of  the  arbitration proceedings  as  without jurisdiction on the ground  of  a  known disability,  the same cannot be allowed. This  principle  applies both before and after making of the award. The principle is  that a party shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold imultaneously. Long  participation and acquiescence in the proceedings  preclude such  a party from contending that the proceedings  were  without jurisdiction.  (1987) 1 Cal LJ 207, Reversed. , Rel. on. \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">   In  the instant case, both parties got extension  of  arbitration proceedings  at  least 14 times, the Arbitrator held  74  sitting which were attended by both parties and their counsel and a large amount of time and money was spent at the cost of public. \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">   Held,  that  in view of the acquiescence of the parties,  one  of them  could not be allowed to challenge the arbitration  proceedings  on ground that because of some disability the matter  could not have been referred to arbitration.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_4\">   It  is  not disputed and it is clear from the proceedings  before  the arbitrator  that  the  respondent did not raise any  objection  before  the arbitrator  about  the proceedings without jurisdiction or  the  arbitrator having  no authority to take upon the disputes which had been  referred  to him.  The  respondent participated in the proceedings without  any  protest and,  in my view, therefore, by participation and acquiescence in the  proceedings before the arbitrator the respondent is estopped from  challenging the jurisdiction of the arbitrator on the ground that the matter could  not be  referred to the arbitrator and the award of the arbitrator,  therefore, cannot be allowed to be challenged on this ground. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"226271\" id=\"span_3\">4. It is next contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that it is  a  case of no evidence inasmuch as no vouchers were placed  before  the arbitrator in support of the claim by the contractor that they had paid any amount  towards increase in the wages of the labour or that there  was  increase in the cost of building material at the relevant time. It is submitted  that  there were vouchers of only Rs.81,000/- for  which  payment  had already  been made and it is not clear from the award of the arbitrator  as to  how a sum of Rs.1,81,000/- has been awarded. According to  the  learned counsel for the respondent, under the terms of the contract, the contractor was  required to submit proof of the payment of escalated wages by  showing the vouchers and this having not been done, the arbitrator has clearly gone beyond the scope of the contract and the award has accordingly been vitiated.  The  arbitrator, according to the learned counsel, has  acted  without jurisdiction or in any case in excess of his powers by allowing the  claims of  the  contractor  for escalation in wages and increase in  the  cost  of material.  She in support of her case has relied upon the Full Bench  judgment  of the Kerala High Court reported as <a href=\"/doc/226271/\" id=\"a_5\">State of Kerala and Another  Vs. V.P.Jolly</a>, .</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"> 5.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1015491\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"226271\" id=\"span_5\">In  <a href=\"/doc/226271/\" id=\"a_6\">State of Kerala and Another Vs. V.P.Jolly</a>, (supra) the  award  was challenged on the ground of arbitrator&#x27;s alleged violation of the terms  of the  contract and the court relying upon the judgment of the Supreme  Court in <a href=\"/doc/1015491/\" id=\"a_7\">Associated Engineering Co. Vs. Govt. of Andhra Pradesh</a>,  \nheld  that if an arbitrator by giving a non-speaking award acts in  contravention  of the clear, obvious or patent terms of the main  contract  which deals  with the rights and obligations of the parties such action  will  be without jurisdiction. For the purpose of finding out if the arbitrator  has so  acted,  it  is open to look outside the  award,  including  affidavits, pleadings and terms of the main contract.</span></span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\"> 6.   The  question before the court, therefore, is whether  the  arbitrator has acted beyond the terms of the contract. The award of the arbitrator  is a non-speaking award. A perusal of the award shows that the arbitrator  had made and published his award after considering the pleadings, the  documentary evidence and the arguments advanced by the parties. Is it open to  the court &quot;to speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled  him to arrive at his conclusions&quot;? In my view, the answer has  to be  in  the negative. The arbitrator is the final arbiter of  the  disputes between the parties and it is not open to challenge the award on the ground the  arbitrator has reached a wrong conclusion or has failed to  appreciate the facts. The Court can not proceed to determine whether the conclusion is right or wrong. It is not open to the Court to attempt to probe the  mental process by which the arbitrator has reached his conclusion, where it is not disclosed  by the terms of the award. One has to determine the  distinction between  the  error within the jurisdiction and an error in excess  of  the jurisdiction. The court cannot substitute its own evaluation of conclusions of  law  or fact to come to the conclusions that the arbitrator  has  acted contrary  to  the  stand taken between the parties.  Whether  a  particular amount  was  liable to be paid is a decision within the competence  of  the arbitrator.  By purporting to consider the contract the court  cannot  take \nupon itself the burden of seeing that this was contrary to the contract and as such beyond jurisdiction. If on a view taken of a contract, the decision of  the  arbitrator on certain amounts awarded is a  possible  view  though perhaps  not  the only correct view, the award cannot be set aside  by  the court. The court, in my view, has no jurisdiction to examine the  different items awarded clause by clause by the arbitrator and to hold that under the contract this was not sustainable on the facts before the arbitrator. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\"> 7.   In  the case of a non-speaking award it is now well settled  that  the court cannot set aside the award unless the error or law is apparent on the face of the award or in a document incorporated therein. Further, in  cases where  the ground of attack is that the award is bad on its face it is  not permissible  for the court even to look into the agreement unless the  same is  incorporated in the award. In the case of a non-speaking award one  has to  confine itself to a document incorporated therein. If the  contract  is not  incorporated in the award it is not permissible for the court to  look outside  the  award and refer to the terms of the contract. It is  not  the case of the respondent that the matter about payment of escalated wages was not  referred  to  the arbitrator. It is true that  the  arbitrator  cannot determine  matters not referred to him but once a matter has been  referred to  him  it is within his powers to take a decision thereon and  the  court cannot over-rule <a href=\"/doc/1015491/\" id=\"a_8\">the said decision</a> merely on the ground that the view taken by  the arbitrator is contrary to the terms of the contract. While  adjudicating  upon the correctness or otherwise of the award of an arbitrator  it has  to be borne in mind that the arbitrator is made the final  arbiter  of disputes between the parties and the award is not open to challenge on  the ground that the arbitrator has reached a wrong conclusion or has failed  to appreciate  facts and evidence. Some finality attaches to the  decision  of the  arbitrator  who  is the judge of both the questions of  fact  and  law referred  to him. The court cannot sit in appeal over the decision  of  the arbitrator by re-examining and re-assessing the material before him. In  my view, therefore, there is no force in the arguments of the respondent  that the award of the arbitrator is without jurisdiction. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_9\"> 8.   The question about the award of interest has not been seriously  challenged  by the learned counsel for the respondent. In any case it  is  well settled that the arbitrator has the jurisdiction to award interest from the date of the award and in my view, therefore, the decision of the arbitrator awarding  10%  interest from the date of the award to the  date  of  decree \ncannot be set aside. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\"> 9.   In  view  of  the above discussion, I do not find any  merits  in  the objections and the same are accordingly dismissed. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\"> 10.  The  award of the arbitrator dated 16th August,1986 is made a rule  of the court and a decree in terms of the award is passed. The petitioner will be  entitled to interest @ 10% per annum from the date of decree  till  the date of payment. In the circumstances of the case, parties are left to bear their own costs. \n</p> \n\n","numcites":6,"numcitedby":12,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":856886,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"acquiescence","formInput":"acquiescence"},{"value":"arbitrator jurisdiction","formInput":"arbitrator%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"final bill","formInput":"final%20bill"},{"value":" award by arbitrator","formInput":"%20award%20by%20arbitrator"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"escalation","formInput":"escalation"},{"value":"speaking award ","formInput":"speaking%20award%20"},{"value":"award of interest","formInput":"award%20of%20interest"},{"value":"arbitration proceedings","formInput":"arbitration%20proceedings"},{"value":"\"arbitration clause\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20clause%22"},{"value":"without jurisdiction ","formInput":"without%20jurisdiction%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"set-aside-award","formInput":"tag:set-aside-award"},{"value":"arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"},{"value":"application-to-file-in-arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:application-to-file-in-arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"power-to-remit-award","formInput":"tag:power-to-remit-award"}],"courtcopy":false,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
