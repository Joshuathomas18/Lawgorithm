The Plaintiff, in each suit, is a company registered in India\n\n                     and engaged in procuring CSFO of edible grade in bulk cargo from the\n\n                     international market.        Bromex Private Limited (Bromex), a company\n\n                     incorporated in India, the third Defendant, acted as the intermediary or\n\n                     broker for facilitating the purchase of CSFO.           The dispute in C.S.\n\n                     No.407 of 2019 relates to 12 contracts that were executed between\n\n                     July 2018 and June 2019 by Gem and ADM. As regards C.S.No.409 of\n\n                     2019, the dispute pertains to 13 contracts that were executed by\n\n                     Sunraja and ADM between May 2018 and June 2019.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                                   5. The respective Plaintiff asserts that there are only four\n\n                     companies which sell CSFO. Out of the four companies, Louis Defrys\n\n                     exited the Indian edible oil market.          The second seller, M/s.Cargill,\n\n                     does not do business through brokers but only undertakes business\n\n                     directly.       The third seller, Bunge Limited, does not undertake much\n\n                     business on the east coast of India.            The Plaintiff, in each case,\n\n                     previously procured CSFO from a company called Nidera between 2011\n\n                     and 2018.          Nidera was a family-run concern with South American\n\n                     owners. However, in August 2017, Nidera was acquired by COFCO, a\n\n                     Chinese Company.             Upon take over of Nidera by COFCO, the\n\n                     requirement for documentation increased, and it was difficult for the\n\n                     9 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                            A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                            and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                            in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     Plaintiff to procure CSFO from COFCO. Consequently, the Plaintiff had\n\n                     no option except to procure CSFO from ADM.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                                   6. The respective Plaintiff also asserts the following. The trade\n\n                     practice is for the broker to nominate a vessel and inform the buyer.\n\n                     Once the buyer confirms the order, the cargo would be loaded onto the\n\n                     vessel. Thereafter, the buyer is required to open letters of credit. Each\n\n                     contract was on CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) basis and the\n\n                     Plaintiff-buyer was entitled to exclusivity. In other words, the vessel\n\n                     was required to carry only cargo meant for the Plaintiff and not for\n\n                     other buyers.         This condition was repeatedly breached by ADM. In\n\n                     addition, there were various quality related issues. The contract was\n\n                     emailed to the Plaintiff only after the cargo was loaded onto the vessel.\n\n                     Even at that juncture, the standard form contract, namely, FOSFA\n\n                     Form 54, was not provided to the Plaintiff.                    The contracts are\n\n                     unconscionable because           they are totally discriminatory against the\n\n                     buyer.         While the seller is entitled to terminate the contract, a\n\n                     corresponding right is not extended to the buyer. Consequently, even\n\n                     though there were major quality issues and repeated breaches of the\n\n                     exclusivity       condition,   the   Plaintiff   was   constrained    to   continue\n\n                     procurement from ADM.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">                     10 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                      A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                      and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                      in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                                   7.   With regard to the arbitration clause, the contention of\n\n                     Sunraja and Gem is as under. Although there is an arbitration clause in\n\n                     each contract, the arbitral institution is FOSFA.              FOSFA is an\n\n                     organisation which is fully controlled by the prominent sellers of oil\n\n                     seeds such as ADM; and the rules of FOSFA do not permit the party to\n\n                     be represented by an advocate. Therefore, the arbitration agreement\n\n                     is void and cannot be enforced.          The suits and the applications for\n\n                     interim anti-arbitration injunction were filed in the above mentioned\n\n                     facts and circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">                                   8.

Mr.Nakul Dewan submitted that the respective Plaintiff and\n\n                     the first Defendant executed multiple contracts for the sale and\n\n                     purchase of CSFO.            All these contracts were based on FOSFA&#x27;s\n\n                     Standard Form 54 subject to variations as agreed to between the\n\n                     parties.

The   contracts\n\n                     admittedly contain an arbitration clause which provides for the\n\n                     resolution of disputes by an arbitral tribunal constituted by FOSFA. The\n\n                     contracts also admittedly provide that the governing law is English law\n\n                     and that court proceedings, if any, should be instituted before the\n\n                     appropriate courts in England. In these circumstances, Mr.Dewan\n\n                     submits that the suits filed by the respective Plaintiff are not\n\n                     maintainable.        Consequently, the respective application for interim\n\n                     injunction is also liable to be dismissed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1857811\" id=\"span_1\">In support of this contention,\n\n                     he relied on the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1857811/\" id=\"a_6\">Modi\n\n                     Entertainment Network v.

With regard to the grant of an anti-arbitration injunction,\n\n                     he submitted that such order is liable to be vacated because the\n\n                     contract clearly provides for dispute resolution through arbitration\n\n                     under the auspices of FOSFA.          He also pointed out that FOSFA is a\n\n                     globally recognised arbitral body and that the allegations of Sunraja\n\n                     and Gem, as regards FOSFA, are unsubstantiated and liable to be\n\n                     rejected out of hand. Given the fact that there is an arbitration clause\n\n                     and the contract is governed by English law, he submitted that this\n\n                     Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction and vacate the interim\n\n                     order which is currently continuing to operate.

On the other hand, Mr.Arvindh Pandian, learned senior\n\n                     counsel for the Respondent/Plaintiff, submitted that the contracts are\n\n                     contrary to public policy and, consequently, void.                 With specific\n\n                     reference to the termination clause, which enables termination by ADM\n\n                     but not by the Indian counter-party, he contended that such clause is\n\n                     unconscionable. Indeed, he contended that Sunraja and Gem could not\n\n                     terminate the contracts in spite of the repeated breaches of the\n\n                     exclusivity requirement by ADM, as evidenced by the correspondence\n\n                     between the parties. He also referred to the judgments of the Delhi\n\n                     High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1688102/\" id=\"a_10\">Unikol Bottlers Ltd. v.

Although FOSFA Form 54\n\n                     enables termination by either party, such clause is not contained in the\n\n                     contracts signed by the parties. Besides, he submitted that the\n\n                     standard form was not provided to the respective Plaintiff at the time\n\n                     of execution of the contract.

In addition, he contended that the arbitration agreement is\n\n                     also void inasmuch as FOSFA is controlled by oil seed producers such\n\n                     as ADM, and it does not qualify as a neutral arbitral institution.\n\n                     Indeed, the respective Plaintiff is not even entitled to engage the\n\n                     services of advocates to prosecute the proceedings in such arbitration.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">                                   14.   With regard to the arbitration agreement, he submitted\n\n                     that FOSFA is not a neutral arbitral institution but is completely\n\n                     controlled by oil seeds producers. According to Mr.Pandian, even the\n\n                     empanelled arbitrators are not neutral. By referring to the panel of\n\n                     arbitrators, he contended that each person named therein has some\n\n                     connection to the one or the other of the major oil seeds producers. In\n\n                     effect, he contended that the empanelled arbitrators are clearly in a\n\n                     conflict of interest situation but are, nevertheless, permitted to act as\n\n                     arbitrators as per the rules of FOSFA. As regards the test of bias, he\n\n                     15 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                    A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                    and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                    in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     contended that it is not necessary to prove actual bias and that it is\n\n                     sufficient to establish justifiable doubts of bias, which threshold has\n\n                     been satisfied by the respective Plaintiff.   For this proposition, Laker\n\n                     Airways Inc v. FLS Aerospace Ltd. (1992) 2 Lloyd&#x27;s Report\n\n                     45(Laker Airways) was relied upon.             For all these reasons, he\n\n                     submitted that the respective Plaintiff cannot expect an impartial\n\n                     adjudication through such arbitration.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                                   15. The conduct of both ADM and FOSFA leave much to be\n\n                     desired according to Mr.Arvindh Pandian. In spite of the grant of an\n\n                     interim injunction by this Court, he pointed out that the arbitration\n\n                     proceedings resumed and, in fact, culminated in an ex parte arbitral\n\n                     award against the respective Plaintiff.        Thus, FOSFA-the second\n\n                     Defendant did not participate in proceedings before this Court and in\n\n                     flagrant disregard of the order of injunction proceeded with the\n\n                     arbitration proceedings and granted an arbitration award in favour of\n\n                     the first Defendant.      This underscores the lack of neutrality and the\n\n                     blatant disregard for the Indian judiciary.    Hence, he submitted that\n\n                     the order of interim injunction should be made absolute and the\n\n                     applications filed by the first Defendant should be rejected.\n\n\n\n\n                     16 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                            A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                            and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                            in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">                                   16. By way of rejoinder, Mr.Nakul Dewan pointed out that it is\n\n                     false that the Plaintiff did not receive               FOSFA Form 54.          Such\n\n                     contention was not raised while the transactions were effected.                 The\n\n                     contention that the arbitral panel of FOSFA is not neutral was also\n\n                     strongly refuted.         According to Mr.Dewan, the respective Plaintiff\n\n                     should not be permitted to resile              from the contractual remedy of\n\n                     arbitration especially when the Plaintiff has miserably failed to\n\n                     demonstrate that such remedy is not effective. Mr.Dewan also pointed\n\n                     out that the first Defendant had approached the High Court of England\n\n                     and Wales to prevent the respective Plaintiff from prosecuting the\n\n                     proceedings an India and that the UK Court had granted an order\n\n                     restraining       the respective   Plaintiff    from    prosecuting    proceedings\n\n                     otherwise than in the manner specified by the contracts.                  The legal\n\n                     position with regard to the grant of anti-arbitration injunction is well\n\n                     settled and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court had laid down the limited\n\n                     circumstances in which interference is warranted.                The present case\n\n                     clearly does not qualify.

When the above clauses are examined cumulatively, the\n\n                     undisputed position that emerges is that all disputes are required to be\n\n                     referred to arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration and\n\n                     Appeal of FOSFA.             As stated earlier, such arbitration would be\n\n                     governed by the <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_17\">English Arbitration Act</a> and the juridical seat of\n\n                     arbitration is England. It is also evident that the contracts are required\n\n                     to be construed in accordance with English law. Thus, there is little\n\n                     doubt that the contract discloses the parties&#x27; intention that the\n\n                     governing and curial law is English law, and that the arbitration would\n\n                     be      governed      by   the   FOSFA   Rules   of     Arbitration   and   Appeal.\n\n                     Consequently, the arbitral tribunal constituted as per the contracts and\n\n                     not Indian courts should exercise jurisdiction, in the first instance, and,\n\n                     thereafter, challenges, if any, would lie before the English courts. The\n\n                     only exception that the contracts carve out, in this regard, is as\n\n                     regards interim measures to secure the claim or counter claim, as the\n\n                     23 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                     A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                     and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                     in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     case may be, which may be requested for before an appropriate court;\n\n                     but it is certainly not the case of the respective Plaintiff that these suits\n\n                     would qualify as actions for such interim measures.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48735888\" id=\"span_6\">22. This leads to the question whether a case is made out to\n\n                     grant an anti-arbitration injunction. The principles relating to the grant\n\n                     of anti-suit injunctions were examined and formulated in paragraph 24\n\n                     of Modi Entertainment, wherein the Supreme Court held, inter alia,\n\n                     that an anti-suit injunction would not be granted to forbear the\n\n                     exercise of jurisdiction by the forum chosen by the parties. Likewise,\n\n                     the law on anti-arbitration injunctions was considered in <a href=\"/doc/48735888/\" id=\"a_18\">McDonalds\n\n                     India Pvt. Ltd. v.

A contention was raised that FOSFA Form 54 was not\n\n                     provided to the Plaintiff, and this contention should be examined. Upon\n\n                     prima facie examining the documents on record, I do not find any\n\n                     contemporaneous document complaining of the non-receipt of FOSFA\n\n                     Form 54. On the contrary, the executed contracts contain a clause\n\n                     stating that the parties admit knowledge and notice of contract Form\n\n                     54 of FOSFA. In this context, it is noteworthy that reciprocal obligations\n\n                     were fulfilled by the buyer and seller as regards some of the executed\n\n                     contracts, all of which used the same template, and the allegation that\n\n                     contract Form 54 was not received did not surface then. Therefore, the\n\n                     material on record does not prima facie support the contention that the\n\n                     respective Plaintiff did not have a copy of the contract Form 54 of\n\n                     FOSFA. However, in order to not prejudice the contesting parties in\n\n                     proceedings before the appropriate forum, I do not propose to enter\n\n                     conclusive findings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"20317\" id=\"span_7\">24.   As   regards   the   contention   that   the   contract   is\n\n                     unconscionable because it permits termination by the seller but not by\n\n                     the buyer; prima facie, such contention appears to be untenable in\n\n                     view of the incorporation of contract Form 54 in the executed contracts\n\n                     with the consequential recourse to the termination clause contained\n\n                     25 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                         A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                         and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                         in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     therein. Although it was urged on behalf of the respective Plaintiff, by\n\n                     placing reliance on Interfoto and AEG, that mere reference to\n\n                     contract Form 54 is insufficient, upon examining the relevant clause, I\n\n                     find that the text prima facie discloses the intention to incorporate\n\n                     Form 54, albeit subject to agreed variations, and it is not a case of\n\n                     mere reference thereto as per principles formulated in that regard in\n\n                     cases such as <a href=\"/doc/20317/\" id=\"a_19\">M.R.Engineers and Contractors Pvt. Ltd. v. Som\n\n                     Datt Builders Ltd.</a> (2009) 7 SCC 696.                     Even otherwise, such\n\n                     contention could be raised before the arbitral tribunal and before the\n\n                     appropriate courts in the UK, if the awards are challenged, given the\n\n                     fact that the governing law under the contract is English law.               The\n\n                     above conclusion would apply equally to the contention that the\n\n                     respective Plaintiff did not have a choice in the matter of procuring\n\n                     CSFO and could only procure the same from ADM. The distinction\n\n                     between an arbitration clause and the other provisions of the contract\n\n                     becomes material in this context, and both severance and the\n\n                     Kompetenz-kompetenz           principle   are   firmly   entrenched   in   Indian\n\n                     jurisprudence, as is evident from Sasan and MSM.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">                                   25. The respective Plaintiff also contended that the arbitral\n\n                     institution is not neutral inasmuch as it is controlled by oil seed\n\n                     26 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                         A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                         and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                         in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     producers. In effect, the respective Plaintiff appeared to contend that\n\n                     any arbitral institution which is set up by a trade organisation is not\n\n                     neutral.       On this issue, reliance was placed on Laker Airways to\n\n                     contend that the onus on the plaintiff is limited to establishing\n\n                     justifiable doubts of bias, and that actual bias need not be established.\n\n                     While “justifiable doubts of bias” may be a valid test when an arbitral\n\n                     tribunal       is challenged either    before    such tribunal or      before   a\n\n                     jurisdictional court; as stated earlier, a higher threshold should be\n\n                     satisfied for an anti-arbitration injunction because the plaintiff should\n\n                     justify       the   departure   from   the    contractual   dispute    resolution\n\n                     mechanism. There are several arbitral institutions spread across the\n\n                     world which are established by organisations or entities that represent\n\n                     the interest of the specific trade.          This is particularly the case with\n\n                     regard to trade in commodities such as cotton, oil, spices and the like.\n\n                     The rationale for the establishment of such arbitral institutions is that\n\n                     domain expertise is necessary to effectively adjudicate such disputes\n\n                     and trade practice and the knowledge thereof is also significant. In the\n\n                     present context, unless it is ex facie evident that the contractual\n\n                     remedy is unconscionable and illusory, either because there was no\n\n                     genuine agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration or for other\n\n                     comparable and compelling reasons, there is no basis to interfere with\n\n                     27 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                      A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                      and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                      in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     the contractual dispute resolution process.

The next contention that should be dealt with relates to\n\n                     the alleged lack of neutrality on the part of the arbitrators. Although\n\n                     such allegation is levelled by the respective Plaintiff, no actionable\n\n                     material has been placed before this Court to substantiate the\n\n                     contention that all the panel arbitrators of FOSFA or the specific\n\n                     arbitrators in the present case are not neutral. Indeed, the facts on\n\n                     record disclose that the respective Plaintiff proceeded to nominate its\n\n                     arbitrator upon receiving a notice of arbitration from ADM.               The\n\n                     decision to abandon the arbitral process and institute proceedings\n\n                     before this Court was taken subsequently. In any event, any grievance\n\n                     on this score should be canvassed before the arbitral tribunal and/or\n\n                     the courts in the UK in accordance with applicable law.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">                                   27.

On\n\n                     perusal of the <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_20\">English Arbitration Act</a>, I find that there are mandatory\n\n                     provisions that ensure equal opportunity (<a href=\"/doc/1977813/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 33</a>). Indeed, there\n\n                     are provisions to challenge an arbitrator (<a href=\"/doc/1460737/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1444341/\" id=\"a_23\">24</a>) and\n\n                     provisions        that   enable:   jurisdictional   challenges   (<a href=\"/doc/472174/\" id=\"a_24\">Section    67</a>);\n\n                     challenges on the ground of serious irregularity (<a href=\"/doc/159834/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 68</a>); and on a\n\n                     point of law (<a href=\"/doc/82458/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 69</a>). Although such provisions are hedged with\n\n                     conditions, it is clear that the grounds of challenge raised here by the\n\n                     respective Plaintiff could have been and may still be raised before the\n\n                     arbitral tribunal or the English courts.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">                                   28. Thus, the respective Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that\n\n                     the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of\n\n                     being performed. In light of the above discussion and analysis, I find\n\n                     no reason to continue the anti-arbitration injunction.            Consequently,\n\n                     the order of injunction granted originally on 05.07.2019 and extended\n\n                     periodically stands vacated.

Before concluding, there is another aspect to be discussed.\n\n                     The order of interim injunction of this Court, which restrained FOSFA\n\n                     from continuing with the arbitration, remained in force until date.\n\n                     During this period, ADM approached the High Court of England and\n\n                     Wales and obtained an order dated July 22, 2019 restraining the\n\n                     respective Plaintiff from, inter alia, taking further steps to prosecute\n\n                     the suit before this Court or to prevent ADM from pursuing either the\n\n                     proceedings before the English Court or the arbitration proceedings.\n\n                     The said order was extended by order dated August 28,2019. Pursuant\n\n                     thereto, it appears that the separate arbitration proceeding against\n\n                     Sunraja and Gem continued and a first partial award was issued by the\n\n                     Arbitral Tribunal on July 29, 2020. From the proceedings of the Arbitral\n\n                     Tribunal, it is evident that Sunraja and Gem did not participate in such\n\n                     proceedings. On these facts, it was contended on behalf of the\n\n                     respective Plaintiff that both FOSFA and ADM proceeded with the\n\n                     arbitration in flagrant violation of the order of this Court and that such\n\n                     conduct        vitiates   the   proceedings.   There     is   no   doubt   that   the\n\n                     appropriate course of action for ADM would have been to proceed with\n\n                     the arbitration after the order of injunction of this Court was\n\n                     discharged upon consideration of its applications. However, in view of\n\n                     the conclusions in the preceding paragraph that the respective Plaintiff\n\n                     30 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                       A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                       and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                       in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     has failed to make out a case for an anti-arbitration injunction and that\n\n                     this Court does not have jurisdiction, I do not propose to interfere with\n\n                     the arbitral process. In my view, the stature and prestige of the Indian\n\n                     judicial system is enhanced by consistently enforcing the rule of law\n\n                     and, by contrast, is undermined if jingoistic impulses hold sway or one-\n\n                     upmanship is indulged in.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">                                   30. Notwithstanding such conclusion, if so advised, it would be\n\n                     open to the respective Plaintiff to cite these proceedings and seek\n\n                     exclusion of time to appeal against the first partial award in accordance\n\n                     with the Rules of Arbitration and Appeal of FOSFA or to initiate\n\n                     appropriate proceedings in the courts in the UK in accordance with the\n\n                     <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_27\">English Arbitration Act</a>. The question as to whether the contesting\n\n                     parties had a reasonable opportunity to present the case and whether\n\n                     a party was under some incapacity could become material if an action\n\n                     for enforcement is initiated subsequently in an Indian court. Although\n\n                     ADM has made out a case in the applications under <a href=\"/doc/724501/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 45</a> of the\n\n                     Arbitration Act, it is not necessary to refer the parties for arbitration\n\n                     because arbitral proceedings have already culminated in a first partial\n\n                     award. Accordingly, the applications to refer the parties to arbitration\n\n                     are disposed of subject to the observations and conclusions contained\n\n                     31 of 34\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                                                         A.Nos.5723 to 5730 of 2019\n                                                                         and O.A.Nos.644 &amp; 645 of 2019\n                                                                         in C.S.Nos.406 &amp; 407 of 2019\n\n                     herein.
