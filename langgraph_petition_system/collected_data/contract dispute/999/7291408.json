The Arbitral Tribunal observed that\n                         certain steps were required to be undertaken by SAIL to provide an\n                         encumbrance free site to the respondent and the same had not been\n                         done. The Arbitral Tribunal also clarified that its view was a prima\n                         facie view based on the inspections carried out by the Arbitral\n                         Tribunal as were noted in Procedural Orders nos. 7 and 9 passed by\n                         the Arbitral Tribunal on 09.07.2019 and 19.09.2019 respectively.

On 25.08.2020, Shri Ashok Sharma, one of the learned\n                         Arbitrators, passed a dissenting order and held that the application\n                         preferred by the respondent under <a href=\"/doc/1513155/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 17</a> of the A&amp;C Act is liable\n                         to be rejected. The learned Arbitrator observed that Clauses 37 and 44\n                         of the GCC provided the right to SAIL to terminate the agreement\n                         under certain circumstances as well as &quot;for any reason&quot;. The learned\n                         Arbitrator held that the Contract, in its very nature, is a determinable\n                         one and thus, cannot be specifically enforced. Further, <a href=\"/doc/124747/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 14(d)</a>\n                         and <a href=\"/doc/1221024/\" id=\"a_13\">41(e)</a> of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 create a prohibition on the\n                         issuance of an injunction directing the specific performance of the\n                         contract between the parties and therefore, there can be no stay of the\n                         Risk Purchase Notice dated 09.11.2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">                         18.

The learned Arbitrator further\n                         observed that the present dispute regarding the Risk and Purchase\n                         Notice dated 09.11.2019 issued by SAIL has originated after reference\n                         to and constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and therefore, the said\n                         notice gives rise to a fresh cause of action, which is beyond the scope,\n                         reference and jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and requires a fresh\n                         reference to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">                         19.

Mr Basu, learned senior counsel appearing for SAIL contended\n                         that the impugned order is liable to be set aside on several grounds.\n                         First, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has, in effect, directed\n                         specific performance of the Contract, which is contrary to the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_16\">Specific\n                         Relief Act, 1963</a>. He submitted that the Contract is determinable and\n                         therefore, no orders could be passed compelling specific performance\n                         of the Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">                         21.     Second, he submitted that the impugned order, in effect, stays\n                         the Risk and Purchase Notice dated 09.11.2019, which is beyond the\n                         scope of <a href=\"/doc/1112600/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 9</a> of the A&amp;C Act as it is not in aid of the arbitral\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                         ARB.

He submitted that the dispute regarding action of SAIL\n                         in issuing the Risk and Purchase Notice dated 09.11.2019 was not a\n                         subject matter of dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal and therefore, no\n                         order interdicting the same could be passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">                         22.     Lastly, he submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal has, in effect,\n                         modified the Risk and Purchase Notice dated 09.11.2019 and directed\n                         SAIL to execute the work on the basis of a no default on the part of\n                         the respondent and, the same is beyond its jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                         Reasons and Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">                         23.     The contentions advanced by Mr Basu are unsubstantial. First\n                         of all, the Arbitral Tribunal has not interdicted SAIL from executing\n                         the balance work remaining to be executed under the Contract either\n                         by itself or through another contractor. The directions issued by the\n                         Arbitral Tribunal are only for preserving the rights and contentions of\n                         the parties. Clearly, if it is found that the respondent is not in breach of\n                         any of its obligations, SAIL&#x27;s action under the Risk And Purchase\n                         Clause would be unsustainable. However, given the disputes between\n                         the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal permitted SAIL to carry on the works\n                         at its own risk, which in any event SAIL is entitled to do under the\n                         Contract. The Arbitral Tribunal has made it amply clear that this is\n                         without prejudice to the rights of either parties. The Arbitral Tribunal\n                         has not precluded SAIL from canvassing that it is entitled to terminate\n                         the contract on account of negligence on the part of the respondent and\n                         to get the balance work executed through another contractor. Mr\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                         ARB.

It\n                         is clear from the impugned order that the Arbitral Tribunal has not\n                         done so. It has, at the interim stage, restrained SAIL from taking any\n                         precipitate steps in that regard while preserving its rights to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                         24.     The contention that the impugned order is beyond the\n                         jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is also unpersuasive. Admittedly,\n                         the dispute between the parties relates to whether the respondent has\n                         delayed the execution of the contract or that SAIL has failed to\n                         perform its reciprocal obligations and is responsible for the delay.\n                         Clearly, if the Arbitral Tribunal finally determines that the respondent\n                         is not in breach of any of its obligations under the Contract, any\n                         further steps including the notices dated 23.08.2019 and 09.11.2019,\n                         which are premised on the basis that the respondent has failed to\n                         perform its obligations under the Contract, would be unsustainable.\n                         Having stated the above, it is not necessary for this Court to examine\n                         the dispute in any detail. The question whether any final relief can be\n                         granted in respect of notices dated 23.08.2019 and 09.11.2019 is also\n                         open for the parties to agitate before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                         25.
