On consideration of the materials on record and the\n\nsubmissions made by the parties, the learned Trial Judge passed the\n\nimpugned order dated February 20, 2019, the relevant portions of the said\n\nimpugned order are reproduced herein below:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">             From the documents it is clearly transpired that as per the existing\n       Rules, even if it may be considered that amended regulations 2018 is\n       invoked, at least with the support of membership of 50% of the\n       recognized Golf club of the state, a State Body can hold the affiliation\n       under the parent body. At this stage from the document itself as well as\n       from the pleading and counter pleading, controversy has been agitated\n       before this Court regarding holding of support of membership of 50%\n       recognized club of the state in favour of the petitioner no.1 claiming to be\n       the state body of Golf. In this context, in the present misc. Case, there is\n       no scope for disputing or assessing the validity of the membership of\n       clubs all round the state, but it is fact that petitioner no.1, The West\n       Bengal Golf Society, is a representing body of the state under the Rules\n       and Regulations of 2014. However, dispute has been cropped up in this\n       regard under the amended Rules and Regulations of 2018, but, since the\n       implementation of Rules and Regulations of 2018 is not beyond the\n       scope of dispute and still awaiting for its final approval justified to\n       prevent the petitioner no.1 to take part in any election process as to be\n       held under prevailing rules and regulations of Indian Golf Indian being\n       the parents body of the Golf in this country simply on the basis of any\n       issue of locus standi. But in this regard proper procedure should be\n       followed on the part of respondent no.1 for convening the election\n       process as to be initiated by Governing Council of respondent no.1 by\n       way of holding Annual General Meeting by giving proper notice to all\n       concerned for election and attaining the voting process. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37097825\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"397996\" id=\"span_15\">In this regard,\n       this Court is very much inclined to allow the petitioner no.1 to\n       participate in such election process as well as voting process as to be\n       convened by respondent no. 1 afresh following the decisions of Hon&#x27;ble\n       Supreme Court held in <a href=\"/doc/397996/\" id=\"a_9\">N.

Mr.   S.N.   Mookherjee,        learned   Senior   Counsel   for   the\n\nappellants, submits that the conclusion arrived at by the learned Trial\n\nJudge that dispute had cropped up between the parties with regard to the\n\neligibility of the respondent no. 1 for membership of the appellant no. 1\n\nunder the Rules and Regulations (2018) of the appellant no. 1 was based\n\non an incorrect fact since the Rules and Regulations (2018) were not\n\npending final approval before the Registrar of Societies, contrary to what\n\nwas held by the learned Trial Judge. Mr. Mookherjee submits that in the\n\nwritten objection filed before the learned Trial Judge, the appellants had\n\ndisclosed the approval granted by the Registrar of Societies under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                       16</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/166887386/\" id=\"a_13\">West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961</a> (hereinafter the &quot;1961 Act&quot;).\n\nHe submits that the records show that the Rules and Regulations (2018)\n\nwere filed before the Registrar on June 7, 2018 and were taken on record\n\non August 24, 2018, with intimation being sent to the appellant no. 1,\n\nmeaning that the said Rules (2018) have statutory effect under <a href=\"/doc/126491633/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n\n9(4)</a> of the 1961 Act. Hence, Mr. Mookherjee submits, the learned Trial\n\nJudge could not have held that the Rules and Regulations (2018) were\n\npending final approval before the Registrar of Societies.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">     16.    The learned Senior Counsel submits that this is further\n\nproved by the production of the records relating to the approval granted to\n\nthe Rules and Regulations (2018) by the Registrar of Societies on\n\nSeptember 5, 2019 in this Hon&#x27;ble Court pursuant to an order of this\n\nHon&#x27;ble Court dated August 28, 2019. Therefore, Mr. Mookherjee submits,\n\nthe directions of the learned Trial Judge are liable to be set aside, and the\n\nappellant no. 1 cannot be restrained from holding an Annual General\n\nMeeting in accordance with the amended Rules and Regulations (2018) as\n\nfiled with the Registrar of Societies. This is argued to be more so because\n\nthe Delhi High Court by an order dated December 12, 2018 in a writ\n\npetition, being W.P. (C) No. 6179 of 2018, has not interdicted any election\n\nor A.G.M. of the appellant no. 1 and has specifically provided that the\n\nA.G.M. and the result of the election in the said A.G.M. of the appellant\n\nno. 1 would be subject to final decision on the writ petition.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                     17</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">    17.     Mr. Mookherjee argues that though the respondents did not\n\nfile an appeal and/or cross-objection against the impugned order,\n\nextensive arguments have been made by the respondents regarding the\n\nE.G.M. on June 6, 2018 along with the notice convening the same and the\n\nresolutions passed thereat. Mr. Mookherjee argues that the respondents\n\ncannot be permitted to raise such arguments. He states that there is no\n\nchallenge to the said E.G.M. and/or the resolution passed therein in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/18293662/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 9</a> proceedings in the court below.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140505203\" id=\"span_19\">18.     Mr. Mookherjee argues that it would be evident from the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/18293662/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 9</a> application made by the respondents, that no prayer challenging\n\nthe validity of the said E.G.M. had been made. In fact, Mr. Mookherjee\n\nargues, the only relief that had been sought in the <a href=\"/doc/18293662/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 9</a> application\n\nwas a restraint order against the appellant no. 1 from holding the A.G.M.\n\nto be convened on December 15, 2018 and/or any other date and/or from\n\nholding or conducting any election of the Office Bearers and/or the\n\nGoverning Council of the appellant no. 1 and/or giving effect to the notice\n\nconvening such A.G.M. and/or taking any steps on the basis of the\n\nresolutions passed at the A.G.M. Accordingly, Mr. Mookherjee argues the\n\nchallenges to the said E.G.M. and/or the resolutions passed therein and\n\nthe notice convening the said E.G.M. cannot be the subject-matter of the\n\npresent appeal. Mr. Mookherjee states that it is a settled principle of law\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                      18</span>\n\n\nthat a court entertaining a suit cannot travel beyond the pleadings and\n\nthat the court cannot record findings on issues that are not part of the\n\npleadings. For this point, Mr. Mookherjee has placed reliance on the\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/140505203/\" id=\"a_18\">Shivaji Balaram Haibatti v. Avinash\n\nMaruthi Pawar</a>, reported in 2018 (11) SCC 652, at paragraph 26 of the\n\nreport.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196858\" id=\"span_21\">Mr. Mookherjee argues that no evidence can be led on pleas that\n\nhave not been specifically raised and no amount of evidence and/or\n\narguments can cure the defects in the pleadings, as held by the Supreme\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/196858/\" id=\"a_19\">Ravinder Singh v. Janmeja Singh &amp; Ors.</a>, reported in 2000 (8)\n\nSCC 191, at paragraph 7 of the report and Bacchaj Nahar v. Nilima\n\nMandal &amp; Anr., reported in 2008 (17) SCC 491, at paragraphs 13 and\n\n17 of the report.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">     19.    Mr. Mookherjee states that it is a well-settled principle that no\n\nrelief can be granted to an applicant, when there is no prayer for a\n\nparticular relief and no pleadings to support such relief. Instead, if the\n\ncourt considers and grants such relief, it will lead to miscarriage of\n\njustice, as held in Bachhaj Nahar (supra) at paragraph 13 of the report.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Mookherjee submits that the Registrar of Societies has\n\nappeared before this Court and duly submitted that the amended Rules\n\nand Regulations have been filed and have been taken on record, as would\n\nbe evident from the order dated September 5, 2019. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"756121\" id=\"span_22\">Mr. Mookherjee states\n\nthat even if the Rules of 2018 were not registered they would still have\n\ncontractual force among the members, as held in <a href=\"/doc/756121/\" id=\"a_20\">Sri Sanatan Dharam\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                     19</span>\n\n\nSabha &amp; Anr. v.

It is also argued by the learned Senior Counsel that the\n\nrespondent no. 1 applied for re-affiliation under the said amended 2018\n\nRules and that the respondents had sought to gain support of 50 per cent\n\nof the golf clubs, which included the 5 golf clubs under the Army Zone.\n\nMr. Mookherjee argues that these clubs in the Army Zone had gone on to\n\nrefuse affiliation with the respondent no. 1. This had meant that the\n\nrespondent no. 1 had failed to get 50 per cent support of the golf clubs in\n\nthe State of West Bengal, thereby failing to become a member of the\n\nappellant no. 1 under the amended Rules. In support of this contention,\n\nMr. Mookherjee draws our attention to the email correspondence\n\nexchanged by and between the parties from August 17, 2018 to October\n\n26, 2018. He argues that it would be evident from these emails that the\n\nrespondent no. 1 had accepted that it had lost affiliation under the\n\namended Rules, that it was required to obtain support of 50 per cent of\n\nthe golf clubs in the State of West Bengal, and that it was taking steps in\n\nthis regard. Mr. Mookherjee submits that the fact that the respondent no.\n\n1 had sought to gain support of 50 per cent of the golf clubs in the State\n\nof West Bengal, including the 5 golf clubs in the Army Zone, is evidenced\n\nfrom the correspondence exchanged between the respondent no. 1 and (i)\n\nMount View Ecological Park and Training Area, Bengdubi from September\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                      20</span>\n\n\n14, 2018 to November 1, 2018, (ii) Kripan Ecological Park and Training\n\nArea, Binnaguri from September 14, 2018 to October 12, 2018, (iii) Rohini\n\nEcological Park and Training Area, Sukhna from September 14, 2018 to\n\nOctober 31, 2018, (iv) Fort William Environmental Park and Training Area,\n\nKolkata from September 14, 2018 to November 12, 2018, (v) Kalimpong\n\nEnvironmental Park and Training Area from September 14, 2018 to\n\nOctober 10, 2018. Mr. Mookherjee argues that this correspondence shows\n\nthat the 5 Army clubs were willing to join the respondent no. 1, as\n\nparticularly evidenced by the letter dated September 15, 2018 sent from\n\nthe Headquarters of the Eastern Command to the President of the\n\nrespondent    no.   1.   However,   according   to   Mr.   Mookherjee,   the\n\ncorrespondence reveals that the respondent no. 1 then asked for the\n\narticles of association and the annual reports of the Army clubs, which\n\nthey clearly would not have, thus leading to the cancellation of their\n\nrequests for affiliation by the letter dated November 16, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_43\">    21.      Mr. Mookherjee argues that these facts had been deliberately\n\nsuppressed in the court below, and once they had been pointed out in the\n\nwritten objection of the appellants, the respondents had, as a complete\n\nafterthought alleged that the 5 Army Zone clubs in the State of West\n\nBengal were not entities that could qualify as golf clubs under the Rules\n\nand Regulations (2014). Mr. Mookherjee states that the appellants had\n\nfiled a supplementary affidavit in the court below to disclose documents\n\nthat proved that the 5 Army Zone clubs were golf clubs and were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                       21</span>\n\n\nrecognised as being affiliated to the appellant no. 1. Further, according to\n\nMr. Mookherjee, the definition of &#x27;Golf Club&#x27; under the Rules and\n\nRegulations (2014) makes it clear that any entity that is affiliated to the\n\nappellant no. 1 having a functional golf course with 9 holes and\n\nmaintaining any such standards as provided by the appellant no. 1&#x27;s\n\nGoverning Council from time-to-time would classify as golf clubs, with the\n\n5 Army clubs satisfying such criteria.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"26596259\" id=\"span_26\">22.    Mr. Mookherjee argues that in a <a href=\"/doc/18293662/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 9</a> application, the\n\ncourt must be convinced that there exists a valid arbitration agreement\n\nbetween the parties, which has not been superseded, as held in SBP &amp;\n\nCo. v.

Mr. Bachawat argues that the respondents have not admitted\n\nthe purported amended Rules of 2018 because the correspondence\n\nbetween the parties cited by Mr. Mookherjee reveals that correspondence\n\nis &quot;without prejudice&quot; to the rights of the respondent no. 1 as a member\n\nand that the said correspondence specifically does not admit that the\n\nRules of 2018 are valid since it states that the respondent no. 1 is having\n\nto apply for membership despite already being a member. In support of\n\nthis contention, Mr. Bachawat draws particular attention to the letter\n\ndated August 17, 2018 sent by the Director General of the appellant no. 1,\n\nwhich states that the appellant no. 1 has amended its Rules and\n\nMemorandum of Association, but does not state that the Rules have been\n\ntaken on record by the Registrar. Mr. Bachawat states that by an email\n\ndated September 1, 2018 sent by the respondent no. 1 to the appellant\n\nno. 1, the respondent no. 1 had asked for the Rules of 2018, but the Rules\n\nwere not sent to the respondent no. 1. This implies that there could not\n\nhave been waiver, as argued by Mr. Mookherjee. Since the respondents\n\ndid know what the Rules were, they could not have acquiesced to them,\n\nand, hence, the letters dated September 14, 2018, October 12, 2018 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                      25</span>\n\n\nNovember 12, 2018 could not be treated as waiver. Mr. Bachawat argues\n\nthat for waiver to operate there needs to be an intentional and positive\n\nabandonment of a right, with full knowledge of the same, and not merely\n\nsilence, as held in <a href=\"/doc/167955958/\" id=\"a_36\">Sonell Clocks &amp; Gifts Ltd. v. New India Assurance\n\nCompany Ltd.</a>, reported in 2018 (9) SCC 784, at paragraph 13 of the\n\nreport and <a href=\"/doc/1965879/\" id=\"a_37\">Power Control Appliances &amp; Ors. v.

Mr. Bachawat also distinguishes the\n\njudgments cited by the appellants in support of their contention that the\n\narbitration clause in the Rules and Regulations (2018) is applicable and\n\nthat the said arbitration clause does not apply to the dispute between the\n\nparties in this case. Mr. Bachawat contends that the respondent no. 1 was\n\nall along a member of the appellant no. 1 and that the attempt to deny its\n\nmembership is wrongful and mala fide, with the ouster of the respondent\n\nno. 1 itself justifying the grant of interim relief. Mr. Bachawat states that\n\nthe Registrar has the power to not take alterations to the Rules on record\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/58106600/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 9(2)</a> of the 1961 Act and since it is not beyond the power of\n\nthe Registrar to do so, it cannot be denied that the respondents&#x27; objections\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                     26</span>\n\n\nare pending before the Registrar. Mr. Bachawat states that once it is\n\nrecognised the E.G.M. was called illegally, the Rules and Regulations\n\nbecome null and void, since there cannot be a building without the plinth\n\nand since the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/166887386/\" id=\"a_40\">West Bengal Societies Registration Act,\n\n1961</a> are mandatory.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59226498\" id=\"span_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192167806\" id=\"span_49\">For these points, reliance is placed on the judgments\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/192167806/\" id=\"a_41\">TRF Ltd. v.

The Registrar of Societies appeared before us on September 5, 2019\n\nand we recorded in our order of the same date that the amended Rules\n\nand Regulations of the appellant no. 1 had been accepted by the Registrar\n\nand recorded on August 24, 2018.

Before determining whether an arbitration agreement exists\n\nbetween the parties with regard to their dispute, it would be appropriate\n\nto ask: what is the dispute between the parties? As is revealed from the\n\npleadings in the court below and the submissions before us, the\n\ncontroversy between the parties is whether the Rules and Regulations\n\n(2014) had been followed by the appellant no. 1 in amending those Rules\n\nand Regulations in the E.G.M. dated June 6, 2018. The substance of the\n\ndispute, therefore, relates not with the Rules and Regulations (2018), but\n\nthe Rules and Regulations (2014). Indeed, there is controversy between\n\nthe parties on the eligibility of the respondent no. 1 to be a State Golf\n\nAssociation under the amended Rules and Regulations of the appellant\n\nno. 1, but the source of that controversy is not because of the Rules and\n\nRegulations (2018), in and of themselves, but because the Rules and\n\nRegulations (2018) were supposedly not validly and properly amended in\n\naccordance with the Rules and Regulations (2014), which had the effect of\n\nexcluding the respondent no. 1 from the membership of appellant no. 1\n\nand then preventing the re-inclusion of the respondent no. 1 as a member\n\nof the appellant no. 1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">     30.    Mr. Mookherjee has strenuously argued that no arbitration\n\nagreement exists between the parties in relation to their dispute because\n\nthe Rules and Regulations (2014) have undergone novation and have been\n\nreplaced by the Rules and Regulations (2018), with the arbitration\n\nagreement in the 2014 Rules (i.e. Rule 70 of the 2014 Rules) being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                         29</span>\n\n\nreplaced by the arbitration agreement in the 2018 Rules (i.e. Rule 66 of\n\nthe 2014 Rules). Mr. Bachawat&#x27;s contention in rebuttal to this is that the\n\n2018 Rules are void ab initio so the alleged novation has not happened\n\nand the arbitration agreement in the 2014 Rules has not been superseded\n\nby the arbitration agreement in the 2018 Rules. Mr. Mookherjee responds\n\nto that argument by stating that the doctrine of severability means that\n\nthe challenge to the validity of the 2018 Rules does not render the\n\narbitration agreement in them invalid. Mr. Bachawat refutes that counter-\n\nargument by stating that a superseding contract that is void ab initio\n\ncannot be severed from the arbitration agreement contained in it. In order\n\nto evaluate the submissions of both counsels, we need to explore the\n\ndoctrine of severability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">     31.     The   severability    of   an   arbitration   agreement,    although\n\npossessing much doctrinal force across jurisdictions for very many years,\n\nis now statutorily enshrined in both the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_45\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996</a> and the UNCITRAL Model Law, which has served as the basis for the\n\nharmonisation of arbitration law across the world. <a href=\"/doc/250697/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 16(1)</a> of the\n\nModel Law declares:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">     &quot;an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an\n     agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision by the\n     arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure\n     the invalidity of the arbitration clause.&quot; (emphasis added)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                         30</span>\n\n\nThe exact same stipulation is put forth by <a href=\"/doc/1763282/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 16(1)</a> of the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996, with the only difference being that the two\n\nsentences quoted above are expressed as clauses (a) and (b) respectively:\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">    &quot;(a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as\n    an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">    (b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall\n    not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.&quot; (emphasis added)\n\n\n\nAs a plain reading of the above quoted statutes would reveal, the\n\nseverability of an arbitration agreement has two aspects: Firstly, an\n\narbitration agreement is an agreement that stands apart from and\n\nindependent of the main contract. Secondly, an arbitration agreement\n\ndoes not automatically become null and void if it is found that the\n\nunderlying contract was in itself null and void. The aim of the severability\n\ndoctrine is to safeguard the arbitral process and to entrench a pro-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">arbitration regime by ensuring that challenges to the validity of the\n\nunderlying contract do not defeat the very mechanism of arbitration that\n\nthe parties have selected to assess such and other challenges.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"633347\" id=\"span_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117411978\" id=\"span_55\">32.     These points have been repeatedly cemented in the case law.\n\nThe English law on this subject can be divided into pre-1996 seperability,\n\nfrom Heyman to Harbour, and post-1996 separability in relation to the\n\njurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to decide such issue. The doctrine of\n\nseperability establishes that an arbitration agreement has a separate life\n\nfrom the contract, for which it provides the means of resolving disputes.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                       31</span>\n\n\nThis enables the arbitration agreement to survive a breach of the contract\n\nof which it is a clause. (See Russell on Arbitration (21st edn.)). To begin\n\nat the ostensible beginning, we find an expression of the severability\n\ndoctrine, decided at the pre-1996 stage, in the House of Lords&#x27; decision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/117411978/\" id=\"a_48\">Heyman &amp; Anr. v Darwins Ltd.</a>, reported in [1942] A.C. 356., which\n\nhas been followed by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/633347/\" id=\"a_49\">National Thermal Power\n\nCorpn. v. Singer Co. &amp; Ors.</a>, reported in 1993 (3) SCC 551 : AIR 1993\n\nSC 998), where Lord Macmillan states (at pp. 373-374 of the report):</span></span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"511787\" id=\"span_57\">&quot;I venture to think that not enough attention has been directed to the true\n    nature and function of an arbitration clause in a contract. It is quite\n    distinct from the other clauses. The other clauses set out the obligations\n    which the parties undertake towards each other hinc inde, but the\n    arbitration clause does not impose on one of the parties an obligation in\n    favour of the other. It embodies the agreement of both parties that, if any\n    dispute arises with regard to the obligations which the one party has\n    undertaken to the other, such dispute shall be settled by a tribunal of their\n    own constitution. And there is this very material difference, that whereas in\n    an ordinary contract the obligations of the parties to each other cannot in\n    general be specifically enforced and breach of them results only in damages,\n    the arbitration clause can be specifically enforced by the machinery of the\n    Arbitration Acts. The appropriate remedy for breach of the agreement to\n    arbitrate is not damages, but its enforcement.&quot; (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\nThis exact statement of the law by Lord Macmillan has been followed by a\n\nlearned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in <a href=\"/doc/511787/\" id=\"a_50\">GTC Ltd. v.

The agreement to arbitrate\n\nnow stands or falls in its own right, as least in so far as concerns any\n\nalleged invalidity of the matrix contract. This is very much in contrast to\n\nthe understanding of severability before 1996 Act, as noted by the learned\n\nauthors of Merkin and Flannery on The Arbitration Act 1996 (6th\n\nedn.) at p. 152:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">        &quot;Although the idea of an arbitration agreement being distinct to any other\n        clause in a contract may be said to have been incipiently recognised at the\n        highest judicial level in Heyman v Darwins, that case imposed strict limits on\n        any doctrine of separability, by in effect ruling out any suggestion that the\n        arbitral tribunal might have competence to consider a claim based on the\n        contract being void ab initio, or vitiated by fraudulent misrepresentation.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167955958\" id=\"span_63\">(emphasis added) (footnotes omitted)\n\n\n\n\nIn this regard two cases are worth mentioning.

The arbitration agreement must\n    be treated as a &quot;distinct agreement&quot; and can be void or voidable only on\n    grounds which relate directly to the arbitration agreement. Of course there\n    may be cases in which the ground upon which the main agreement is invalid\n    is identical with the ground upon which the arbitration agreement is invalid.\n    For example, if the main agreement and the arbitration agreement are\n    contained in the same document and one of the parties claims that he never\n    agreed to anything in the document and that his signature was forged, that\n    will be an attack on the validity of the arbitration agreement.&quot; (emphasis\n    added)\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the extent to which this position of the law\n\nrepresents a departure from <a href=\"/doc/117411978/\" id=\"a_60\">Heyman</a> (supra), it would be useful to refer to\n\nMerkin and Flannery (supra) at pp. 154-155:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">    &quot;Having established that an arbitration clause is capable of surviving\n    termination of its host agreement, the courts gradually moved towards a\n    fuller concept of separability by a series of decisions (most of which fell after\n    the Act came into force) holding that an arbitration clause could, if\n    appropriately worded, apply to any questions as to the existence or validity\n    of the clause itself or the underlying contract, including any issues as to\n    frustration, repudiation or illegality affecting the underlying contract........\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">    Prior to Fiona Trust, there were authorities that had begun to creep away\n    from the narrow, old-fashioned view. For example, in Vee Networks Ltd v.\n    Econet Wireless International Ltd. ([2005] 1 Lloyd&#x27;s Rep. 192), Colman J had\n    held that <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 7</a> empowered the arbitrator to decide whether or not a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                        35</span>\n\n\n     contract of supply was void for being ultra vires one party&#x27;s corporate\n     objects.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">     Fiona Trust itself concerned allegations that the director general of the\n     Russian state-owned shipping company had been bribed to enter into\n     charterparties with companies owned by the alleged briber, each containing\n     an arbitration clause, and that, by reason of the (alleged) bribery, the\n     charterparties were void, and as a consequence the arbitration clauses\n     became &#x27;null and void&#x27; (the issue having arisen in the context of a <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 9</a>\n     stay application). The approach of the judge at first instance was much\n     infected by the narrow wording of each of the arbitration clauses in the\n     charters, which referred to &#x27;disputes arising under this charter&#x27;. The Court\n     of Appeal (led by Longmore LJ) took a different, and fresh, approach to the\n     question of separability and held that the arbitration clauses survived the\n     attack on the charters, by reason of the principle of separability (as laid\n     down in <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 7</a>), and held that the clauses should be regarded as\n     encompassing issues that went to the validity of the underlying\n     charterparties. The House of Lords (led by Lord Hoffmann) endorsed this\n     approach, and the arbitral tribunal was permitted to consider the issue of\n     bribery......\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">     The concept of separability simply reflects the parties&#x27; presumed intention\n     that their agreed procedure for resolving disputes should remain effective in\n     circumstances that would render the substantive contract ineffective. &#x27;Its\n     purpose is to give legal effect to that intention, not to insulate the\n     arbitration agreement from the substantive contract for all purposes.\n     Nonetheless, what Lord Hoffmann did leave open in Fiona Trust was the\n     possibility of an attack directly on the arbitration agreement, although the\n     examples he gave in course of his speech (forged signature on matrix\n     agreement; agent signing without authority) would appear to us not to be\n     such as to remove any jurisdiction of the tribunal to investigate the\n     allegations, and therefore their own jurisdiction. As Lord Hope put it, such\n     allegations are only parasitical to a challenge to the validity of the main\n     agreement.&quot; (footnotes omitted)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"124874895\" id=\"span_67\">35.

It would be abundantly clear from the discussion of the law\n\nabove that as a consequence of severability, inter alia, the invalidity of the\n\nunderlying contract does not invalidate the arbitration agreement made\n\npursuant to it. However, as a matter of principle, one cannot say for\n\ncertain that the same follows when the underlying contract is substituted\n\nby a new contract. The Indian and English authorities seem to be at\n\nvariance on this. The Indian authority on this point is the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_70\">Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta &amp; Bros.</a>, reported\n\nin 1960 (1) SCR 493 : AIR 1959 SC 1362, where Subba Rao, J.

Though the phraseology was of the widest\n     amplitude, it is inconceivable that the parties intended its survival even\n     after the contract was mutually rescinded and substituted by a new\n     agreement. The fact that the new contract not only did not provide for the\n     survival of the arbitration clause but also the circumstance that it\n     contained both substantive and procedural terms indicates that the parties\n     gave up the terms of the old contracts, including the arbitration clause.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">     (emphasis added)\n\n\n\nIn apparent contrast, the English High Court in DDT Trucks of North\n\nAmerica Ltd. &amp; Ors. v DDT Holdings Ltd.

In my judgment, first thoughts were best. I cannot see\n    that the Arbitrator&#x27;s jurisdiction would be in any way affected by the\n    termination of the Distributorship Agreement. It was argued by Mr\n    Berragan, who appeared for Holdings, that the 4 November 1999 Airport\n    Agreement brought the Distributorship Agreement to an end and\n    terminated all rights to compensation under Schedule 3 with the result that\n    there was nothing left to arbitrate about and no possibility of triggering an\n    arbitration by a failure to agree on such compensation. The right to a\n    compensatory payment and the right to arbitrate in default of agreement\n    about such a figure both came to an end.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">    16. I am unable to accept that submission. The terms of <a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 7</a> of the\n    Arbitration Act 1996 provide that &quot;unless otherwise agreed by the parties,\n    an arbitration agreement which forms ... part of another agreement ... shall\n    not be regarded as invalid, non-existent or ineffective because that other\n    agreement is invalid, or did not come into existence or has become ineffective,\n    and it shall for that purpose be treated as a distinct agreement &quot;. This is a\n    statutory codification of the well recognised position which existed prior to\n    the Act -- see Harbour v Kansa [1993] QB 701 . If the Distributorship\n    Agreement had been brought to an end by accepted repudiation or\n    frustration, the Arbitration Agreement would continue in being in order to\n    deal with issues of compensation, should such arise. It is nothing to the\n    point that the assignment of assets by Holdings occurred after the\n    termination of the Distributorship Agreement, since the allegation is made\n    that compensation is due under the agreement. Whilst the effect of the\n    Airport Agreement, if binding and effective, would be to negate any claim, it\n    would not of itself bring the Arbitration Agreement to an end once a claim\n    for compensation, which could not be agreed, was made. In my judgment\n    there was no agreement to bring the Arbitration Agreement to an end within\n    the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_73\">section 7</a> , when the Distributorship Agreement was allegedly\n    brought to an end and Holdings could point to no wording which suggested\n    that this was the case.&quot; (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_74\">37.     It would seem that the binding judgment here, i.e. <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_74\">Kishorilal\n\nGupta</a> (supra) is the one that is also more principled. The doctrine of\n\nseverability recognises the fact that the arbitration agreement in a\n\ncontract is what H.L.A. Hart, the towering Legal Positivist, would call a\n\n&quot;secondary rule&quot; in his book The Concept of Law (Ch. 5), i.e. a rule that\n\nallows one to decide upon the validity, operation, etc. of the &quot;primary\n\nrules&quot;, in this case, the provisions of a contract.

The principle laid down is that if the\n    contract is superseded by another, the arbitration clause, being a\n    component part of the earlier contract, falls with it.

To better understand the reasoning on which the judgement\n\nof the Supreme Court is based in <a href=\"/doc/190370690/\" id=\"a_81\">Young Achievers</a> (supra) and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_82\">Kishorilal Gupta</a> (supra), we may return again to the terminology of\n\nH.L.A. Hart in his book The Concept of Law. As a secondary rule, we\n\nhave already clarified that the arbitration agreement is parasitic to the\n\nunderlying contract. So while its validity and existence is independent of\n\nthe underlying contract, the arbitration agreement is still attached to it.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                     41</span>\n\n\nAnd when the contract to which the arbitration agreement is attached is\n\nreplaced by a new contract, the arbitration agreement cannot govern\n\ndisputes under the new contract, since it was never attached to that new\n\ncontract. Now, if there is an arbitration agreement in the new contract and\n\nthe dispute is that the new contract has not actually replaced the old\n\ncontract, then, in the same way, the arbitration agreement in the new\n\ncontract cannot govern that dispute. To say that the arbitration agreement\n\nwould govern such a dispute would be to say that the arbitration\n\nagreement in the new contract can govern the dispute of whether the old\n\ncontract has been replaced. This would not be acceptable because the\n\narbitration agreement in the new contract is parasitic to that new\n\ncontract. Indeed, the arbitration agreement in the new contract can\n\ngovern the disputes under the new contract and a challenge to the validity\n\nof that new contract would not be a challenge to its validity. But being\n\nparasitic to the new contract, the arbitration agreement cannot be severed\n\nfrom the new contract and then be made to cover the dispute of whether\n\nthe old contract has been replaced. To say otherwise would be to sever the\n\narbitration agreement from the thing to which it is attached and then to\n\nattach it to something else entirely, which, as we have established is\n\nimpermissible with regard to a secondary rule.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_86\">41.     The seperability of the arbitration clause leads to the further\n\nproposition that even where there is an attack on the validity or existence\n\nof the main contract, the tribunal is free to examine issues such as the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                       42</span>\n\n\nvalidity of the arbitration clause, the validity of their own appointments\n\nand the issue as to what matters have been submitted to arbitration.\n\nHence, there is a natural link between the question of whether there exists\n\nan arbitration agreement and the oft-used expression of kompetenz-\n\nkompetenz, i.e. arbitral autonomy, as would be clear from a plain reading\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The\n\nkompetenz-kompetenz principle allows the arbitrator to decide on his own\n\njurisdiction and requires the court to defer to the decision of the arbitrator\n\nin that regard, if it is convinced that the arbitrator has the jurisdiction to\n\ndecide upon his/her own jurisdiction, i.e. if the court is convinced that\n\nthere exists a valid arbitration agreement. Keeping that connection\n\nbetween the kompetenz-kompetenz principle and the finding of whether\n\nthere exists an arbitration agreement in mind, we can say that the\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_84\">Kishorilal Gupta</a> (supra) was deciding upon the\n\njurisdiction of the arbitrator to decide upon his/her own jurisdiction when</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">(i) either the contract has been superseded by another contract or (ii) the\n\ncontract supposedly superseding the earlier contract is disputed as void\n\nab initio. In scenario (i) the Supreme Court said that the arbitrator&#x27;s\n\njurisdiction to decide upon his jurisdiction resides in or arises out of the\n\narbitration agreement contained in the superseding contract. The\n\nreasoning behind that conclusion was that the arbitration agreement in\n\nthe older contract does not survive because the older contract (to which\n\nthe older arbitration agreement is attached) itself does not exist any\n\nlonger. Therefore, the arbitration agreement under which the arbitrator\n\nhas jurisdiction to decide upon his jurisdiction is contained in the new\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                       43</span>\n\n\ncontract, presuming, of course, that there is an arbitration agreement in\n\nthe new contract. However, as in scenario (ii), when the question of\n\nwhether the older contract has been superseded at all is the issue then\n\nthe arbitrator&#x27;s ability to decide upon his own jurisdiction cannot reside in\n\nthe arbitration agreement contained in the new contract. The arbitration\n\nagreement in the new contract is linked to that new contract and the\n\njurisdiction of the arbitrator to decide on his own jurisdiction under the\n\narbitration agreement in the new contract cannot conceptually jump\n\nbackwards to allow him/her to decide if the older contract has been\n\nreplaced. Therefore, the arbitrator&#x27;s jurisdiction to be able to decide on his\n\nown jurisdiction when the dispute is that the new contract is void ab initio\n\nmust reside in the arbitration agreement contained in the old contract.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_89\">The arbitrator may, when deciding upon his jurisdiction under said\n\narbitration agreement in the old contract, conclude that the old contract\n\nhas been validly superseded and that the new contract is not void ab\n\ninitio, thereby concluding that he/she does not have jurisdiction to decide\n\non his own jurisdiction. But for a court to go into that question of whether\n\nthe contract has or has not been validly superseded in order to decide\n\nupon the arbitrator&#x27;s jurisdiction will offend the kompetenz-kompetenz\n\nprinciple because that would prevent the arbitrator from being allowed to\n\ndecide on his own jurisdiction. In summary, therefore, when scenario (ii)\n\nappears in front of us and the dispute is that the supposedly superseding\n\ncontract is void ab initio, we will be inclined to hold that it is the\n\narbitration agreement in the older contract which governs that dispute, for\n\nthat would allow the arbitrator under that arbitration agreement to decide\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                      44</span>\n\n\nif the new contract is void ab initio and thereby decide if he/she has\n\njurisdiction at all or not. Of course, all of this is stated under the\n\nassumption that in scenario (ii) the validity and existence of the\n\narbitration agreement in the old contract is itself not under challenge, for\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_85\">in that case</a> the court will have to then decide the validity and existence of\n\nthe arbitration agreement in the old contract as well.</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">    42.     To summarise the discussion above, we may say that: the\n\nprinciple severability of an arbitration agreement applies when the validity\n\nof the contract to which it is attached is under question. But when the\n\ncontract whose validity is under question has been superseded by a new\n\ncontract then the arbitration agreement in the old contract cannot be\n\nsevered and then attached to a new contract. However, if the validity of\n\nthe new superseding contract is itself in question then severability does\n\nnot operate to allow the arbitration agreement in the new contract to\n\ngovern the dispute of whether the new contract is void ab initio. Instead,\n\nthe arbitration agreement in the old contract is the one that governs that\n\ndispute of whether the new contract is void ab initio.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_91\">43.     On consideration of our understanding of the doctrine of\n\nseverability, we may return to the dispute between the parties, i.e.\n\nwhether the Rules and Regulations (2014) were amended properly and\n\nvalidly by the E.G.M. of June 6, 2018. In other words, the dispute between\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                        45</span>\n\n\nthe parties is whether the Rules and Regulations (2018) are void ab initio\n\nor not or whether there has been a valid supersession of the Rules and\n\nRegulations (2014). In such circumstances, the Rules and Regulations\n\n(2014) are required to be looked into and considered to find out if the\n\nprocedure in the Rules of 2014 has been followed in adopting the Rules of\n\n2018. The Rules and Regulations (2014) survive to that extent. The\n\nvalidity of the 2018 Rules is itself the dispute, which means that, following\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_86\">Kishorilal Gupta</a> (supra), the arbitration agreement in the 2018 Rules\n\ncannot apply here, as the dispute is arising out of the Rules and\n\nRegulations (2014). The question of the validity of the 2018 Rules depends\n\nupon   whether    the   2014   Rules    were   followed   in   bringing   about\n\namendments to the 2014 Rules. Thus, as argued by Mr. Bachawat, it\n\nwould be the arbitration agreement in the Rules and Regulations (2014),\n\ni.e. Rule 70 of those Rules, which would be applicable to the dispute\n\nbetween the parties. Hence, the first issue is resolved in favour of the\n\nrespondents: there exists an arbitration agreement between the parties\n\nwhich governs the dispute between them, so the learned Trial Judge had\n\nthe jurisdiction to entertain the application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 9</a> of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. However, this finding should not\n\ninfluence the arbitrator/arbitral tribunal should there be an issue raised\n\nwith regard to its jurisdiction, in view of the Rules of 2018, by either of the\n\nparties in course of arbitration. The arbitrator&#x27;s autonomy to decide its\n\nown jurisdiction is not affected by our finding.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                      46</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">\n\n\nThe Second Issue\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">    44.

The order of the court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 9</a> is intended to protect the subject-matter of the\n\nproceedings and to secure the interest of the party claiming such relief.\n\nThe exercise of the Court&#x27;s powers under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act to grant interim reliefs is governed by certain settled\n\nprinciples. One of the foundational cases which illuminates the principles\n\nwhich govern the exercise of a court&#x27;s powers under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 9</a> is <a href=\"/doc/1847057/\" id=\"a_92\">Adhunik\n\nSteels Ltd. v.

The judgement of the Supreme Court in this case\n\nstates that since <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 9</a> does not provide any specific guidelines or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                          47</span>\n\n\nrules of procedure or requirements for the exercise of the court&#x27;s powers\n\nunder it, the court must follow the ordinary rules and requirements for\n\nthe grant of interim measures when dealing with an application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 9</a>. The relevant paragraph of <a href=\"/doc/1847057/\" id=\"a_95\">the said judgment</a> i.e. paragraph 11\n\nof the report where this principle is enunciated is reproduced herein\n\nbelow:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">    &#x27;It is true that <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 9</a> of the Act speaks of the court by way of an interim\n    measure passing an order for protection, for the preservation, interim\n    custody or sale of any goods, which are the subject-matter of the arbitration\n    agreement and such interim measure of protection as may appear to the\n    court to be just and convenient. The grant of an interim prohibitory\n    injunction or an interim mandatory injunction are governed by well-known\n    rules and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while enacting <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 9</a>\n    of the Act intended to make a provision which was dehors the accepted\n    principles that governed the grant of an interim injunction. Same is the\n    position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the section itself\n    brings in the concept of &quot;just and convenient&quot; while speaking of passing any\n    interim measure of protection. The concluding words of the section, &quot;and\n    the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the\n    purpose and in relation to any proceedings before it&quot; also suggest that the\n    normal rules that govern the court in the grant of interim orders is not sought\n    to be jettisoned by the provision. Moreover, when a party is given a right to\n    approach an ordinary court of the country without providing a special\n    procedure or a special set of rules in that behalf, the ordinary rules followed\n    by that court would govern the exercise of power conferred by the Act. On\n    that basis also, it is not possible to keep out the concept of balance of\n    convenience, prima facie case, irreparable injury and the concept of just and\n    convenient while passing interim measures under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 9</a> of the Act.&#x27;\n\n    (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1847057\" id=\"span_96\">46.

Applying the principles developed\n\nin such case law on Order XXXIX mutatis mutandis in the context of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 9</a>, we can say that the acid test of whether a prima facie case is\n\nestablished requires us to ask whether the petitioner in the <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 9</a>\n\napplication can show that, in all probability, the petitioner is entitled to\n\nobtain permanently the interim measure sought by it, as would appear in\n\nthe preliminary stage of the trial before going into the evidence from the\n\npleadings and the admitted documents. The petitioner, in short, needs to\n\nmake out an arguable case on merit that may stand to trial. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1576087\" id=\"span_98\">In the words\n\nof the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1576087/\" id=\"a_104\">Krishan Murgai v.\n\nSuperintendence Company of India (P) Ltd.</a>, reported in AIR 1979 Del\n\n232, at paragraph 1 of the report:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86507\" id=\"span_99\">&#x27;&quot;You cannot&quot;, they say, &quot;have the cake and eat it too&quot;.

The jurisdiction of an appeal court seeking to assess whether\n\na trial court has erred in finding that a prima facie case exists must be\n\nanimated by a spirit of restraint and respect for the judicial discretion of\n\nthe trial court. The rationale for this is that an appeal court, while a\n\nmaster of the macrocosm of the law is still a distant observer of the\n\nmicrocosm of the dispute under it. The preserve of the microcosm of the\n\nlaw is that of the trial judge and his discretion therein must be given its\n\ndue respect. Nevertheless, if it is fundamentally clear that a prima facie\n\ncase has most evidently not been established then the appeal court must\n\nimpress upon the microcosm the greatness of the macrocosm.

In sum, the cases tell us that in order to\n\nestablish on which side the balance of convenience lies, we must\n\ninvestigate if and to what extent the plaintiff cannot be compensated in\n\ndamages if the uncertainty were resolved in its favour and if and to what\n\nextent the defendant cannot be compensated in damages for being\n\nprevented from exercising its legal rights if the case were ruled in its\n\nfavour. The court must engage in balancing both these competing\n\nconsiderations to determine where the balance of convenience lies. The\n\naim of the requirement for the balance of convenience to be in the\n\nplaintiff&#x27;s favour for grant of interim relief is based on the need to prevent\n\nthe defendant from having to take on a greater burden than is necessary.\n\nWe may cite two authorities in support of the aforesaid. The first is <a href=\"/doc/86507/\" id=\"a_109\">U.P.\n\nAvas Evam Vikash Parishad &amp; Ors.</a> (supra) at paragraph 14 of the\n\nreport, which is set out herein below:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">     &#x27;Another circumstance, which the Court below should have examined, was\n     whether balance of convenience lay in favour of the plaintiffs in granting the\n     injunction or in favour of the defendants by its refusal. The Court below did\n     not consider it even fit to go into this question and examine all its aspects.\n     The extraordinary nature of the remedy by injunction calls for careful\n     application of this guiding principle and it is safe to say that rarely will\n     injunctive relief be granted when it would operate inequitable or to control the\n     real justice of the case. Although this doctrine is well recognised, but it is\n     difficult in governing in all inclusive rule, which would encompass the\n     factual situation in all cases, that is, each case, so far as the application of\n     the doctrines of relative or comparative injury is concerned, rest upon the\n     particular or peculiar circumstances of that case. In American Cyanamid\n     Co. v. Ethicon Ltd., (1975) 1 All ER 504 House of Lords laid down the\n     principles governing grant of interlocutory injunction. The court lay\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                         51</span>\n\n\n    emphasis on the consideration of balance of convenience and found that if\n    there was no balance of convenience in favour of the plaintiffs no injunction\n    need be granted. It was observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">    &quot;The object of the interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against\n    injury by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately\n    compensated in damages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were\n    resolved in his favour at the trial; but the plaintiff&#x27;s need for such protection\n    must be weighed against the corresponding need of the defendant to be\n    protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented from\n    exercising his own legal rights for which he could not be adequately\n    compensated under the plaintiffs undertaking in damages if the uncertainty\n    were resolved in the defendant&#x27;s favour at the trial. The court must weight\n    one need against another and determine where the balance of convenience\n    lies.&quot; &#x27; (emphasis added)\n\n\n\nIn this regard we may also gainfully refer to the judgment of Lord Scott in\n\nFourie v. Le Roux &amp; Ors., reported in [2007] 1 W.L.R. 320, at\n\nparagraph 33 of the report, where His Lordship says:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">    &quot;Whenever an interlocutory injunction is applied for, the judge, if otherwise\n    minded to make the order, should, as a matter of good practice, pay careful\n    attention to the substantive relief that is, or will be, sought. The\n    interlocutory injunction in aid of the substantive relief should not place a\n    greater burden on the respondent than is necessary. The yardstick in <a href=\"/doc/1312664/\" id=\"a_110\">section\n    37(1)</a> of the 1981 Act, &quot;just and convenient&quot;, must be applied having regard\n    to the interests not only of the claimant but also of the defendant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">    (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"54328508\" id=\"span_105\">50.     The final requirement for grant of interim measures under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act requires irreparable loss\n\nand injury to the plaintiff if the measure is not granted. This requirement\n\nimplies that the court must exercise its discretion in a <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 9</a>\n\napplication sparingly and only in those cases, where, after exercising\n\nextreme caution, it is clear that the arbitration proceeding is likely to be\n\nfrustrated if the interim measure is not granted and that the defendant is\n\nlikely to render the entire arbitration process infructuous by frittering\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                         52</span>\n\n\naway the properties or funds that could from part of the compensation to\n\nthe plaintiff. This also means that the injury to the plaintiff due to not\n\ngranting the interim measure should be such that it cannot be\n\ncompensated by an award of damages. Authority on these two points is\n\nfound in, firstly, the Division Bench judgment of the Delhi High Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/54328508/\" id=\"a_113\">C.V. Rao &amp; Ors. v. Strategic Port Investments KPC Ltd. &amp; Ors.</a>,\n\nreported in 2014 (4) Arb LR 9 (Del) (DB), at paragraph 37 of the report,\n\nwhich is quoted herein below:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"521759\" id=\"span_107\">&quot;The law is well settled that the discretion of the court to grant interim relief\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 9</a> of the Act has to be exercised sparingly and only in\n    appropriate cases and the courts should be extremely cautious in granting\n    the interim relief. As held in Olex Focas Pty. <a href=\"/doc/521759/\" id=\"a_115\">Ltd. and another vs.\n    Skodaexport       Company      Ltd.   and      another</a>,    AIR    2000     Delhi\n    161=1999(Suppl.) Arb. LR 533 (Del.), the power to pass orders with regard\n    to interim measures should always be exercised by court for the purpose of\n    safeguarding the interest of the parties to the arbitration proceeding so that\n    the award is not frustrated. The court&#x27;s discretion ought to be exercised in\n    those exceptional cases when there is adequate material on record leading to\n    a definite conclusion that the respondent is likely to render the entire\n    arbitration proceedings infructuous, by frittering away the properties or funds\n    either before or during the pendency of arbitration proceedings or even during\n    the interregnum period from the date of award and its execution.&quot;</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86507\" id=\"span_108\">(emphasis\n    added)\n\n\n\nThe second authority on this point is found in <a href=\"/doc/86507/\" id=\"a_116\">U.P. Avas Evam Vikash\n\nParishad &amp; Ors.</a> (supra) at paragraph 15 of the report, which is quoted\n\nherein below:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">    &quot;If a plaintiff of a suit can be compensated by payment of damages law does\n    not require giving or granting of an injunction in such a case to the\n    plaintiff.

In the instant appeal, we can see good reason to interfere with\n\nthe discretion exercised by the learned Trial Judge. As revealed from a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                      53</span>\n\n\nproper reading of the impugned order, the learned Trial Judge has not\n\nexamined (i) whether there is a prima facie case in favour of the\n\nrespondents, (ii) whether the balance of convenience is in the respondents&#x27;\n\nfavour and (iii) whether there would be irreparable loss or injury to the\n\nrespondents if the appellant no. 1 was restrained from conducting its\n\nA.G.M. under the Rules and Regulations (2018) of the appellant no. 1.\n\nThis clearly shows that the impugned order has not been passed with an\n\napplication of mind to the relevant considerations and the law, which, as\n\nhas been held by the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in <a href=\"/doc/86507/\" id=\"a_117\">U.P.\n\nAvas Evam Vikash Parishad &amp; Ors.</a> (supra) at paragraph 17 of the\n\nreport, is a ground for an appeal court to interfere with the order. As shall\n\nbe explained, none of the cardinal principles for the grant of a restraining\n\norder under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are\n\nsatisfied here.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">     52.     We may first consider whether a prima facie case has been\n\nestablished by asking two questions, in accordance with the law explained\n\nabove: First, would the respondents, on the balance of probabilities, get\n\nthe relief of a permanent injunction against the appellants from holding\n\nA.G.M.s in accordance with the Rules and Regulations (2018)? Second, is\n\nthere a serious issue for the arbitral tribunal to consider here? The\n\nanswer to both those questions is returned in the negative when one\n\nconsiders that the Rules and Regulations (2018) have been taken on\n\nrecord by the Registrar of Societies. Had there been a fair chance of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                      54</span>\n\n\nRules and Regulations (2018) being null and void or illegal, the Registrar,\n\ntaking cognizance of the letters sent by the respondents, would have made\n\nenquiries or done something more before taking the Rules on record or\n\nwould have refused to do so altogether. As rightly pointed out by Mr. Sen,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel for the Registrar, the letters sent by the Registrar\n\nto the appellants (with regard to the respondents&#x27; grievances with the\n\namendment of the Rules) were not in the nature of show-cause notices,\n\nsince the content of those letters does nothing more than request the\n\nappellants to respond to the allegations of the respondents. If the Rules\n\nand Regulations (2018) were taken on record by the Registrar, then the\n\nprobability that the respondents would ultimately be able to get a\n\npermanent injunction against the appellants from holding an A.G.M.\n\nunder the Rules and Regulations (2018) is far from high. In the same way,\n\nthe fact of the Rules and Regulations (2018) being taken on record means\n\nthat the arbitral tribunal does not have a serious issue to try in respect of\n\nthe validity of the said Rules, when viewed at the interim stage. In other\n\nwords, the respondents have not been able to make out a prima facie case\n\nfor getting an injunction restraining the appellants from holding an\n\nA.G.M. under the Rules and Regulations (2018) on December 15, 2018.\n\nThe learned Trial Judge was simply in error on the facts in holding that\n\nthe dispute over the Rules was pending before the Registrar, and in\n\nproceeding to make his ruling on that basis.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                       55</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">     53.    We may draw further support for this conclusion by\n\nexamining the correspondence between the parties with regard to the\n\napplication by the respondent no. 1 for re-affiliation with the appellant no.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1579938\" id=\"span_113\">1. The wording of these communications does not prima facie indicate\n\nthat the respondent no. 1 is truly seeking to re-affiliate with the appellant\n\nno. 1 &quot;without prejudice&quot; to its existing status as a member. Indeed, the\n\nemail dated September 14, 2018 from the President of the respondent no.\n\n1 to the Director General of the appellant no. 1 states that &quot;we [i.e. the\n\nrespondent no. 1] have also been asked to apply for affiliation, whereas,\n\nwe are already affiliated to the Union [i.e. the appellant no. 1]&quot;. But these\n\nwords must be understood in their proper context (see <a href=\"/doc/1579938/\" id=\"a_119\">Chairman and\n\nMD, NTPC Ltd. v. Reshmi Contructions, Builders &amp; Contractors</a>,\n\nreported in 2004 (2) SCC 663, at paragraph 32 of the report). The lines\n\nafter these quoted words reveal that these quoted words are meant to be a\n\nquery, since the email goes on to ask for the exact basis on which the\n\nrespondent no. 1 has been asked to submit the names of its members.\n\nMoreover, the correspondence thereafter reveals a clear intent to submit\n\nto the Rules of 2018 by the respondent no. 1. By an email dated\n\nSeptember 25, 2018, the President of the respondent no. 1 clearly asks\n\nthe Director General of the appellant no. 1 for the list of clubs in the State\n\nof West Bengal, stating that the respondent no. 1 would not be able to\n\ntake any action on re-affiliating itself without such a list. Furthermore, by\n\nan email dated October 25, 2018, sent by the President of the respondent\n\nno. 1 to the Director General of the appellant no. 1, it is clear that the\n\nrespondent no. 1 wishes to be compliant with the Rules of 2018, since it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                      56</span>\n\n\nstated in the email that the respondent no. 1 has been asking for the new\n\nRules multiple times due its desire to be compliant with them. This\n\naforesaid email also states that the respondent no. 1 had been seeking the\n\nnames of the clubs for clarification and that it was taking action to\n\naffiliate them all, in compliance with the appellant no. 1&#x27;s directions. That\n\nthis aforesaid email was sent after the respondent no. 1&#x27;s application for\n\naffiliation without support of the Army clubs was rejected by the appellant\n\nno. 1&#x27;s email dated October 25, 2018 is of great significance. Had the\n\nrespondent no. 1 truly felt that the Army clubs were not clubs and had\n\nthe respondent no. 1 truly sought to re-affiliate with the appellant no. 1\n\n&quot;without prejudice&quot;, it would not have sought to convey its desire to\n\ncomply with the new Rules and to affiliate the Army clubs in accordance\n\nwith the appellant no. 1&#x27;s requirements without any protest. Thus, at the\n\ninterim stage, it would appear that prima facie the respondent no. 1 had\n\nacquiesced to the Rules of 2018, thereby making its case for interim relief\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 9</a> even weaker.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">    54.     The balance of convenience is simply not in favour of the\n\nrespondents. The prevention of the respondent no. 1 from holding its\n\nA.G.M. on December 15, 2018 and from conducting the election of the\n\nOffice Bearers and Governing Council of the appellant no. 1 in that A.G.M.\n\nhas led to the possibility of the appellant no. 1 being de-recognised by the\n\nappropriate authority. In fact, we have had to pass an order stating that\n\nduring the pendency of this appeal, the appellant no. 1 may cite the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                      57</span>\n\n\norder to prevent de-recognition. In such circumstances, restraining the\n\nappellant no. 1 from conducting its A.G.M. and also approving its\n\naccounts therein is simply too drastic an interruption for it to be capable\n\nof compensation in damages if the arbitration is decided in the favour of\n\nthe appellants. It is simply requiring the appellant to undertake a\n\nhardship that is greater than is just and convenient.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_100\">    55.      Finally, there is no reason to believe that there would be\n\nirreparable loss to the respondent no. 1 if the A.G.M. dated December 15,\n\n2018 of the appellant no. 1 was conducted without the respondent no. 1\n\nbeing in the Electoral College for the election of the Office Bearers and\n\nGoverning Council of the appellant no. 1. Erring on the side of caution, as\n\nthe law requires, there is no reason to believe that if the appellant no. 1\n\nhad its A.G.M. on December 15, 2018 and elected its Governing Council\n\nand approved its accounts therein, then the arbitration process would be\n\nrendered infructuous or frustrated. The losses that may be suffered by the\n\nrespondent no. 1 due to it not being capable of participating in this A.G.M.\n\nwould not cause undue hardship compared to the prejudice likely to be\n\ncaused if the injunction is allowed to continue. The respondent has not\n\nbeen able to make out a case of an &quot;irreparable prejudice&quot; that is likely to\n\nbe caused in the event the interim order is not passed.\n\n\nConclusion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                         58</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">     56.    Thus, for the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed. The\n\nimpugned order of the learned Trial Judge is set aside. We reiterate that\n\nnothing in this order may be construed as a final expression of opinion on\n\nthe merits of the controversy between the parties, which the arbitral\n\ntribunal may eventually decide. The arbitral tribunal shall decide the\n\ndisputes between the parties uninfluenced by the observations made by\n\nus in this order. This order also disposes of C.A.N. 4948 of 2019.
