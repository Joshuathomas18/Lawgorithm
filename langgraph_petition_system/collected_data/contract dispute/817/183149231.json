It is contended by Mr.Kolar that trial court erred in\n\nholding that Civil Court at Hospet has got jurisdiction to try the\n\nsuit when admittedly defendant is from the State of Gujarath\n\nand agreements to supply iron ore and all other terms and\n\nconditions of supply were incorporated in the purchase orders\n\nissued by the defendant which clearly stipulated that dispute if\n\nany was subject to courts at &quot;Ahmedabad Only&quot; and as such, he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     -5-</span>\nI\n\n     contends that finding of the trial court is erroneous on the\n\n     question ofjurisdiction as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/175502059/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 20(c)</a> of CPC. He\n     would also contend that trial court erred in holding that PW-1\n\n     had never agreed to the Clauses 19(j) and 20 of purchase orders,\n\n     only on the basis of oral evidence, ignoring the exclusion clauses\n\n    found in the purchase orders which was in writing. He would\n\n    also contend that trial court ignored to take note of the fact that\n\n    despite Clauses 19(j) and 20 found on the back-side or the\n\n    reverse side of the purchase orders, which came to be admitted\n\n    by PW-1 and findings of the trial court that he had not signed\n\n    the purchase orders and as such said clauses are not binding on\n\n    him is an erroneous finding.       He would also elaborate his\n    submission by contending that trial court erred in not noticing\n\n    the fact that defence set up by defendant was not that the court\n\n    at Hospet had no jurisdiction at all, but the defence was that in\n\n    view of the exclusion Clause 19(j) and 20 agreed to by parties,\n\n    Court at Hospet had no jurisdiction and would submit that\n\n    question of delivery at Hospet by plaintiff would not make any\n\n    difference when parties had agreed to vest the jurisdiction in\n\n    court at Ahmedabad and exclude the jurisdiction of Hospet\n\n    Court.

Officials of the defendants\n are at Hospet; they have interacted and co-ordinated with\n\nplaintiff at Hospet; offer is given to supply goods at Hospet;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">goods have been supplied from Hospet, goods have proceeded on\n\ndelivery by road transport as well as by rail transport from\n\nHospet and as such Civil court of Hospet does have jurisdiction\n\nand not the court of Ahmedabad.          He would elaborate his\nsubmissions by further contending that when purchase orde\n                                                          r\ndated 25.05.2006 was issued as per Ex.P-1, immediately\n\nplaintiff brought to the notice of defendant that he is not\n\nagreeable to the terms and conditions stipulated by defendant\n\nincluding clauses now pressed into service and on the very same\n\nday, defendant through its Senior Assistant General Manager\n\n(Purchase), wrote a letter which came to be marked as Ex.P\n\n1038 dated 25.05.2006, specifically assuring the plaintiff that\n\nthis discussions held between plaintiff and representatives of the\n\ndefendant at Hospet had been discussed at Ahmedabad Office\n\nand clarification was issued saying that the purchase orders are\n\nnormally in a standard format and it was understood by the\n\nparties that clauses mentioned therein need not be given effect\n\nto by parties.   It is contended that to substantiate this aspect,\n the Proprietor of the plaintiff Firm got himself examined as PW- I\n\nand he has explained the circumstances under which                   1\n\ncame to be issued, as also queries raised by the plaintiff\n\nimmediately thereunder and reply received from defendant dated\n\n25.05.2005, Ex.P1038 would clearly go to show that parties\n\nnever agreed upon such a condition which is now pressed into\n\nservice and with regard to these two clauses being pressed into\n\nservice, there was no meeting of minds between the parties and\n\nevidence tendered by plaintiff has remained unrehutted.            Sri\n\nPaul would bring to the    notice of   this Court, cross-examination\n\nof plaintiff dated 05.01.2010 to substantiate that exclusion\n\nclause to oust the jurisdiction of Hospet court was not agreed to\n\nbetween the parties.

Gammon (India) Ltd.\n[1971] 3 S.C.R. 3 14 where the appellant agreed to do certain\nconstruction work        or the respondent who had its principal\nplace of business at Bombay on the terms and conditions of a\nwritten tender. Clause 12 of the tender provided for arbitration\nin case of dispute. Clause 13 provided that notwithstanding\nthe place where the work under the contract was to be\nexecuted the contract shall be deemed to have been entered\ninto by the parties at Bombay, and the Court in Bombay alone\nshall have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon. On dispute arising\nbetween the parties the appellant submitted a petition to the\nCourt at Varanasi for an order under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_19\">section 20</a> of the\nArbitration Act, 1940 that the agreement be filed and an order\nof reference be made to an arbitrator or arbitrators appointed\nby the Court. The respondent contended that in view of the\nClause 13 of the arbitration agreement only the Courts at\nBombay had jurisdiction. The Trial Court also held that the\nentire cause of action had arisen at Varanasi and the parties\ncould not by agreement confer jurisdiction on the Courts at\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                         -   16   -\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">Bombay which they did not otherwise possess. The High\nCourt in revision held that the Courts at Bombay had\njurisdiction under the general law and hence could entertain\nthe petition and that in view of Clause 13 of the arbitration\nagreement the petition could not be entertained at Varanasi\nand directed the petition to be returned for presentation to the\nproper Court. On appeal therefrom one of the questions that\nfell for consideration of this Court was whether the Courts at\nBombay alone had jurisdiction over the dispute. It was held\nthat <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_20\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> in its entirety applied to\nproceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_21\">Arbitration Act</a> by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_22\">section 41</a>\nof that Act. The jurisdiction of the Court under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_23\">Arbitration\nAct</a> to entertain a proceeding for filing an award was\naccordingly governed by the provisions <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_24\">of the Code of Civil\nProcedure</a>. By the terms of <a href=\"/doc/55027036/\" id=\"a_25\">section 20(a)</a> of the Code of Civil\nProcedure read with explanation 11 thereto the respondent\ncompany which had its principal place of business at Bombay\nwas liable to be sued at Bombay. It was held that it was not\nopen to the parties to agreement to confer by their agreement\njurisdiction on a Court, which did not possess under the\nCode. But where two Courts or more have under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_26\">the Code of\nCivil Procedure</a> jurisdiction to try the suit or proceeding an\nagreement between the parties that the dispute between\nthem shall be tried in one of such Courts was not contrary to\npublic policy and such an agreement did not contravene\n<a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_27\">section 28</a> of the Contract Act. Though this case arose out of\nan arbitration agreement there is no reason why the same\nrule should not apply to other agreements in so far as\njurisdiction is concerned. Without referring to this decision a\nDivision Bench of the Madras High Court in Nanak Chand v.\nT.T.

It is open\n          for a party for his convenience to fix the jurisdiction of any\n          competent court to have their dispute adjudicated by that\n          Court atone. In other words if one or more Court has the\n          jurisdiction to try any suit, it is open for the parties to\n          choose any one of the two competent Courts to decide\n          their disputes.

The Explanation\n  applies to a defendant which is a Corporation which term would\n  include even a company.

It is well settled in law that the issue regarding jurisdiction\n  of the   Courts    has   to       be   decided   upon   the   facts   and\n  circumstances of each case.

Therefore, even though the irregular exercise of\n     jurisdiction is a matter in which the parties can waive as held in\n     NANAK CHAND case, referred supra, in our considered opinion,\n     if the parties to the contract agree with a consensus on a\n     particular term of the agreement that the dispute shall be\n     decided only by a particular Court having jurisdiction, the ouster\n     or exclusion of the other Courts cannot be lightly disregarded\n     merely because of the absence of the words only or alone in the\n    said clause. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1069885\" id=\"span_22\">We are therefore unable to subscribe ourselves to\n    the view that the parties to the agreement can waive the irregular\n    exercise of the jurisdiction as held in NANAK CHAND case,\n    referred supra, or with the view expressed in <a href=\"/doc/1069885/\" id=\"a_33\">MIs.SPONGE\n    IRON INDIA LTD.</a> case, referred supra, that the ouster of the\n    jurisdiction of other Courts cannot be implied in the absence of\n    the words only or alone in the clause of the agreement between\n    the parties which deals with the jurisdiction of this Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">    10.3. It is true the Apex Court in A.B.C.LAMINART PVT. LTD.\n    case, referred supra, held that so long as the parties to a\n    contract do not oust the jurisdiction of all the Courts which would\n    otherwise have jurisdiction to decide the cause of action under\n    the law, it cannot be said that the parties have, by their contract,\n    ousted the jurisdiction of the Court, and that if under the law\n    several Courts would have jurisdiction and the parties have\n    agreed to submit to one of these jurisdictions and not to other or\n    others of them, it cannot be said that there is total ouster of\n    jurisdiction.

In   view   of   these rival contentions, it will now boil\n\ndown to the fact as to whether exclusion clauses mentioned in\n\nEx.P-1 to Ex.P-18 would oust the jurisdiction of Civil Court at\n\nHospet and vest with the jurisdiction to the Court at Ahmedabad\n\nto try the suit.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">      24.

In fact, witness, PW-1, when\n\n being cross examined was confronted with bills raised by the\n\n plaintiff which came to be marked as Ex.D-1 to Ex.D-62 and as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  -39-</span>\n\n\nseen     from     Ex.D-3    to   8,     10,   12,15,18,19   to   25,\n27,29,30,32,33,37,38,40,...etc., the goods have been supplied\n\neven prior to issuance of the purchase orders corresponding to\n\nthese            invoices        namely           Ex.P-819,82 1,823,\n\n825,827,829,835,839         etc. This would clearly go to show that\n\nthere was no meeting of minds between the parties with regard\n\nto exclusion clause namely, to exclude jurisdiction of Civil Court\n\nat Hospet and to vest the jurisdiction for resolution of disputes\n\nexclusively with Civil Court at Ahmedabad. The evidence read in\n\nits entirety would clearly go to show that parties to the lis were\n\nnot at ad idem in so far as these two clauses are concerned.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">        (c)     This view is also fortified from the fact that the\n\ndefendant in order to have a smooth and efficient working of the\n\ncontract had established its branch office at Hospet. One of its\n\nDirectors was at Hospet The branch office was headed by an\n\nofficial of the defendant. All discussions with regard to the due\n\nexecution of the contract namely supply of iron ore between the\n\nplaintiff and the defendant were being discussed at Hospet and\n\nthe officials at Hospet were laisoning with their head office at\n\nAhmedabad from Hospet and on their instructions were\n\ninteracting with the officials of the plaintiffs at Hospet.      The\n\ngoods have been despatched by defendant through railway rakes\n\nand also by road transport from Hospet. These undisputed facts\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">                                -   40   -\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">would clearly got to show that the parties had not agreed to vest\n\nthe civil Court at Ahmedabad to try disputes if any between\n\nparties as a forum of convenience.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">      26.   Yet another factor which also requires to be noticed\n\nby this Court is, the invoices raised by defendant, Ex.D-1 to 62\n\nwhich came to be confronted to PW- 1 in the cross examination\n\nwould go to show that plaintiff had informed the defendant\n\nthrough the said invoices that jurisdiction to try disputes if any\n\nwould be vested with Hospet Courts. Though Sri Jayavital Rao\n\nKolar would hasten to add that in the purchase orders at Ex.P- 1\n\nto Ex.P- 18, it had been made amply clear that any other clauses\n\nmentioned by the plaintiff regarding vesting of jurisdiction of\n\nCourt other than Ahmedabad Court would not have any effect\n\nwould be of no consequences either way, in as much as,\n\ndefendants have admitted that part of cause of action arose\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of Hospet court and this Court having\n\nopined, as discussed hereinabove, that parties were not at\n\nadidem in so far as exclusion clause by virtue of overwhelming\n\nevidence tendered by PW-1 the claim and counter claim raised\n\nby   the    respective   advocates      in   this   regard   recedes   to\n\nbackground.      The trial court on examination of the entire\n\nmaterial produced before it and on appreciation of evidence\n\ntendered by the plaintiff through its proprietor as PW- 1, which\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">                                   -41   -\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">evidence,      admittedly   has   remained   unrebutted   since   the\ndefendant or its representative have not entered witness box to\n\nrebut that no such discussion was held with the plaintiff during\n\nMay 2006 immediately after Ex.P- 1 came to bc issued, trial\n\ncourt has rightly answered preliminary issue No.5 in the\n\nnegative and held that Civil Court at Hospet has got jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">The said finding does not suffer from either excessive exercise of\n\njurisdiction nor it suffers from any material irregularity calling\n\nfor interference in exercise of revisional jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">         27.
