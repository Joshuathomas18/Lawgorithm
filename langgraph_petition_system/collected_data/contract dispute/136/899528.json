A/186 and A/187 subject to \ndeposit of Rs.2 lakhs by the first respondent with the Registrar \nGeneral within two days of receipt of the certified copy of the order.\n\tThe first respondent Chand Mal Baradia filed Title Suit No. 993 \nof 1999 in the City Civil Court at Calcutta for permanent injunction \nrestraining the defendants from proceeding with the arbitration \nproceedings, which had been initiated by the appellant Shree \nSubhlaxmi Fabrics Pvt. Ltd.   The case of the plaintiff (first \nrespondent) in brief is that he was carrying on business under the \nname and style of M/s. Chand Mal Prakash Chand and Co. at \nCalcutta; that Shree Subhalaxmi Fabrics Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai (defendant \nNo. 1), which is a company registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_2\">Companies Act</a> and \nsells cloth through its agent M/s. Naresh Enterprises, which has its \noffice at Calcutta, under the terms and conditions as dictated by \ndefendant No. 1; that the plaintiff was getting supplies against the \norders placed by him at Calcutta through the agent of defendant No. 1; \nthat all such supplies were made by the agent to the plaintiff at \nCalcutta at his premises No. 160, Jamunalal Bajaj Street and all \npayments made by the plaintiff were collected by this agent on behalf \nof defendant No. 1 at Calcutta; that the plaintiff was taking delivery of \ngoods at Calcutta on the basis of Railway Receipts/Lorry Receipts and \nconsignment notes from the said agent M/s. Naresh Enterprises.  The \ncase of the plaintiff further is that there was no arbitration agreement \nbetween the plaintiff and defendant No. 1 at any point of time for \nreferring their disputes to any arbitrator; that he was not a member of \ndefendant No. 2 M/s. Hindustan Chambers of Commerce, having its \noffice in Mumbai.  As the plaintiff became seriously ill some time in \nearly part of 1997, he could not look after his business and \nconsequently there was some delay in making payments to defendant \nNo. 1; that the plaintiff paid more than Rs. 4 lakhs to defendant No. 1 \nand the last payment was made on 27.2.1999; that in April, 1999 the \nplaintiff received two notices from defendant No. 2 intimating that the \ndefendant No. 1 had initiated arbitration proceedings and the plaintiff \nwas asked to nominate an arbitrator and send a sum of Rs.200/- as \narbitration fee; that the defendant No. 2 had no jurisdiction or \nauthority to act as an arbitrator and accordingly the plaintiff requested \nit not to proceed with the arbitration case.  The case of the plaintiff \nfurther is that the defendant No. 1 initiated another arbitration \nproceeding bearing No. A/186 before defendant No. 2 claiming that \nM/s. Chand Mal Prakash Chand and Co. was also the proprietor of \nArihant Textiles; that the plaintiff informed by sending a letter to \ndefendant No. 2 on 18.5.1999 that he had never placed any order in \nthe name of Arihant Textiles at any point of time and, therefore, the \ncase be dropped.  The plaintiff filed an application under Order 39 \nRule 1 and 2 and <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 151</a> CPC for restraining the defendants from \nproceeding with the arbitration cases.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\tThe appellant Shree Subhlaxmi Fabrics Pvt. Ltd. (defendant \nNo. 1) opposed the prayer for grant of injunction and also filed an \napplication under <a href=\"/doc/1673226/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 20</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 151</a> CPC on the \nground inter alia that the defendant No. 1 is a cloth merchant, which is \ncarrying on business all over India; that M/s. Naresh Enterprises \nhaving its office at Calcutta had been engaged as a middleman by the \nappellant, who procured a buyer namely Chand Mal Prakash Chand &amp; \nCo. represented by Chand Mal Baradia and others at Calcutta; that \nM/s. Naresh Enterprises contacted defendant No. 1 at Mumbai for \nsupply of cloth upon which the defendant No. 1 sent their indents \nthrough the said middleman to the said M/s. Chand Mal Prakash \nChand &amp; Co. (plaintiff), which was duly accepted by them; that the \ndefendant No. 1 supplied cloth valued at approximately Rs.20 lakhs in \n1996-97 to the plaintiff; that in the indents (contracts) terms and \nconditions were mentioned and condition Nos. 6 and 7 read as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;Clause \u0016 6\tDispute under this contract shall be decided by the \nCourt of Bombay and no other courts.\nClause \u0016 7\tIf any dispute arises about the transaction the same \nshall have to be referred to the Hindustan Chamber \nof Commerce, Bombay, for decision under its \nArbitration Rules.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">It was further stated in the application filed by the appellant \n(defendant No. 1) that in the indent/offer letter, which was prepared \nand sent by the middleman M/s. Naresh Enterprises, to the office of \ndefendant No. 1 a condition was mentioned regarding jurisdiction of \ncourts, which reads as under: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;UNDER JURISDICTION OF THE COURT \nFROM WHERE THE GOODS HAVE BEEN \nDESPATCHED&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">In all the bills/invoices, which were sent to the plaintiff, it was \nspecifically mentioned at the top &quot;subject to Mumbai jurisdiction&quot; and \nat the left hand side at the bottom the following was written: -\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;In case of dispute arising out of the transaction \nbetween the vendors and the purchaser and the \nbrokers or agent either for payment or any other \ndispute in relation to the transaction, the same shall \nbe referred to the Hindustan Chamber of \nCommerce, Mumbai, for decision under its \nArbitration Rules and the Award made thereunder \nshall be binding upon the parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">Since dispute arose between the parties regarding payment of the \ngoods sold and delivered, the appellant referred the matter to the \nHindustan Chamber of Commerce, Mumbai, for arbitration and \nappointed Shri Shikhar Chand Jain as its arbitrator.  The Hindustan \nChamber of Commerce (defendant No. 2) had entered upon the \nreference and had served a notice upon the plaintiff by letter dated \n31.3.1999 calling upon them to appoint one of their arbitrators from \nthe panel/list sent by it and further to deposit Rs.200/- as arbitration \nfee.  The said letter was duly replied by the plaintiff on 20.4.1999 \nalong with a fee of Rs.200/-.  A specific plea was thus raised by \ndefendant No. 1 that the court at Calcutta had no territorial jurisdiction \nto try the suit and further that in view of the arbitration agreement \ncontained in the indent (contract) and also the fact that the plaintiff \nhad already responded to the notice issued by the defendant No. 2, \nthere was no ground for granting any injunction order in their favour.\n\tThe City Civil Court at Calcutta, after a detailed consideration \nof the matter, held that the said court had no jurisdiction to try the suit \nand further that the arbitration proceedings having already \ncommenced, the civil court should not interfere with the functioning \nof the arbitrator (defendant No. 2).  It was accordingly held that the \nplaintiff had no prima facie case to go for trial and the balance of \nconvenience lies in favour of the defendants.  It was further held that \nthe plaintiff will not suffer any irreparable injury in the event of \nrefusal of injunction.  The application was accordingly dismissed by \nthe order dated 22.2.2000.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\tFeeling aggrieved by the order of City Civil Court the plaintiff \npreferred an appeal before the Calcutta High Court under Order 43 \nRule 1 (r) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_6\">CPC</a>.  The High Court held that an objection as to the \nexistence of the arbitration agreement can be taken either before the \narbitrator or by way of a suit in a competent court, the initial choice \nbeing of the aggrieved party.  If the court is approached, it is a matter \nof discretion of the court even at the final hearing, whether to decide \nthe suit or to refer the matter to the arbitrator, allowing a decision by \nthe arbitrator himself on the point.  Regarding jurisdiction the High \nCourt held that the plaintiff has no doubt an arguable case that he did \nnot consciously agree to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the courts.  \nIt was further held that the plaintiff&#x27;s plea that &quot;from where the goods \nhave been dispatched&quot; is not sufficiently specific as to exclude a \ncourt&#x27;s jurisdiction is no doubt an arguable case.  On these findings \nthe appeal was allowed and all further proceedings in arbitration cases \nA/186 and A/187, initiated by the defendant No. 1 before defendant \nNo. 2, were stayed subject to the plaintiff&#x27;s depositing Rs. 2 lakhs \nwith the Registrar General within two days of the receipt of the \ncertified copy of the order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">\tShri M.N. Krishnamani and Shri Jaideep Gupta, learned senior \nadvocates, who have appeared for the appellant Shree Subhlaxmi \nFabrics Pvt. Ltd. (defendant No. 1) have assailed the order of the High \nCourt on two grounds.  The learned counsel have submitted that the \nindent (contract) contained a clause that in case any dispute arises \nabout the transaction the same shall have to be referred to the \nHindustan Chamber of Commerce, Mumbai, for decision under its \nArbitration Rules and as such there was an arbitration agreement \nbetween the parties, which was invoked by the appellant by making a \nreference to defendant No. 2.  The defendant No. 2 had sent a notice \nto the plaintiff asking it to nominate an arbitrator from the panel/list \nsupplied to it and also to remit an amount of Rs.200/- towards the fee \nof arbitration.  The plaintiff responded by sending a reply and also an \namount of Rs.200/-.  In such circumstances the plaintiff cannot \ncontend that there is no arbitration agreement between the parties.  \nThat apart it is open to the plaintiff to raise such a plea before the \narbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 16</a> of The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, \n1996 (hereinafter referred to &quot;the Act&quot;).  The second ground urged is \nthat there was an agreement between the parties that the disputes \narising under the contract shall be decided by the courts at Bombay \nand by no other courts and consequently courts at Calcutta had no \nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain the suit.  The learned counsel have \nthus submitted that the High Court committed manifest error of law in \ngranting an injunction order in favour of the plaintiff and in passing a \nrestraint order staying further proceedings before the arbitrators.\n\tShri V.A. Mohta, learned senior counsel for the respondent No. \n1 (plaintiff), on the other hand, submitted that there was no arbitration \nagreement between the parties as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/914339/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 7</a> of the \nAct and, therefore, the reference made to the arbitrator by the \nappellant is wholly invalid and the defendant No. 2 has no jurisdiction \nto proceed with the arbitration.  He has further submitted that a part of \ncause of action had accrued at Calcutta and the plaintiff had never \nconsciously agreed to any condition that any dispute arising between \nthe parties shall be decided by the courts at Bombay and by no other \ncourts and, therefore, the court at Calcutta had the jurisdiction to try \nthe suit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">\tBefore examining the contentions raised by the learned counsel \nfor the parties it will be convenient to take note of certain provisions \nof the Act.  <a href=\"/doc/1587602/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1230543/\" id=\"a_10\">5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/914339/\" id=\"a_11\">7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_12\">16</a> of the Act read as under: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;4.\t Waiver of right to object. \u0016 A party who \nknows that \u0016\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(a)\tany provision of this part from which the \nparties may derogate, or \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(b)\t any requirement under the arbitration \nagreement,\nhas not been complied with and yet proceeds with \nthe arbitration without stating his objection to such \nnon-compliance without undue delay or, if a time \nlimit is provided for stating that objection, within \nthat period of time, shall be deemed to have \nwaived his right to so object.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;5.

Competence of arbitral tribunal to rule on \nits jurisdiction. \u0016 (1) The arbitral tribunal may \nrule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on \nany objections with respect to the existence or \nvalidity of the arbitration agreement, and for that \npurpose, -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(a)\tan arbitration clause which forms part of \na contract shall be treated as an \nagreement independent of the other terms \nof the contract; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(b)\ta decision by the arbitral tribunal that the \ncontract is null and void shall not entail \nipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration \nclause.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(2)\tA plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have \njurisdiction shall be raised not later than the \nsubmission of the statement of defence; however, a \nparty shall not be precluded from raising such a \nplea merely because that he has appointed, or \nparticipated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.\n(3)\t A plea that the arbitral tribunal is exceeding \nthe scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as \nthe matter alleged to be beyond the scope of its \nauthority is raised during the arbitral proceedings.\n(4)\t The arbitral tribunal may, in either of the cases \nreferred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), \nadmit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.\n(5)\t The arbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea \nreferred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) \nand, where the arbitral tribunal takes a decision \nrejecting the plea, continue with the arbitral \nproceedings and make an arbitral award.\n(6)\t A party aggrieved by such an arbitral award \nmay make an application for setting aside such an \narbitral award in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/675604/\" id=\"a_13\">section 34</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\"> \t<a href=\"/doc/1230543/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 5</a> of the Act provides that notwithstanding anything \ncontained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters \ngoverned by Part I (<a href=\"/doc/1455010/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 2</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1502796/\" id=\"a_16\">43</a>), no judicial authority shall \nintervene except where so provided in the said part.  This clearly \nindicates the legislative intent to minimize supervisory role of courts \nto ensure that the intervention of the court is minimal.  <a href=\"/doc/1587602/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 4</a> is a \ndeeming provision, which lays down that where a party proceeds with \nthe arbitration without stating his objection to non-compliance of any \nprovision of Part I from which the parties may derogate or any \nrequirement under arbitration agreement, it shall be deemed that he \nhas waived his right to so object.  <a href=\"/doc/914339/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 7</a> provides that the \narbitration agreement shall be in writing and such an agreement may \nbe in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a \nseparate agreement.  Sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/914339/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 7</a> provides the \nconditions under which a document or exchange of letter or exchange \nof statement of claim and defence may amount to an arbitration \nagreement.  <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 16</a> of the Act is important and it provides that the \narbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, including ruling on \nany objections with respect to the existence or authority of the \narbitration agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">\t<a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a> of the Act provides for appointment of arbitrators \nand sub-section (6) thereof empowers the Chief Justice of the High \nCourt or any person or institution designated by him to make such an \nappointment on the happening of certain conditions enumerated in \nclauses (a), (b) or (c).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1752565\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/1752565/\" id=\"a_22\">Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. vs. Mehul Construction Co.</a> \n2000 (7) SCC 201, a three Judge Bench of this Court held that at the \nstage when a party has approached the Chief Justice for appointment \nof an arbitrator, the contentious issues should not be decided at that \nstage and the aggrieved party can raise all the objections including \nobjection regarding non-existence of an arbitration clause before the \narbitral tribunal.  The Bench observed as under in para 4 of the \nreport:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\t&quot;When the matter is placed before the Chief \nJustice or his nominee under <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11</a> of the Act \nit is imperative for the said Chief Justice or his \nnominee to bear in mind the legislative intent that \nthe arbitral process should be set in motion without \nany delay whatsoever and all contentious issues \nare left to be raised before the Arbitral Tribunal \nitself.  At that stage it would not be appropriate for \nthe Chief Justice or his nominee to entertain any \ncontentious issue between the parties and decide \nthe same.  A bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/1960266/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_25\">16</a> of \nthe Act makes it crystal clear that questions with \nregard to the qualifications, independence and \nimpartiality of the arbitrator, and in respect of the \njurisdiction of the arbitrator could be raised before \nthe arbitrator who would decide the \nsame\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005  \n\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005.... \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\"><a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 16</a> empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to rule \non its own as well as on objections with respect to \nthe existence or validity of the arbitration \nagreement.  Conferment of such power on the \narbitrator under the 1996 Act indicates the \nintention of the legislature and its anxiety to see \nthat the arbitral process is set in motion.  This \nbeing the legislative intent, it would be proper for \nthe Chief Justice or his nominee just to appoint an \narbitrator without wasting any time or without \nentertaining any contentious issues at that stage, by \na party objecting to the appointment of an \narbitrator.  If this approach is adhered to, then \nthere would be no grievance of any party and in \nthe arbitral proceeding, it would be open to raise \nany objection, as provided under the \nAct\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1405409\" id=\"span_2\">Similar view has been taken in <a href=\"/doc/1405409/\" id=\"a_27\">State of Orissa and others vs. \nGokulananda Jena</a> 2003 (6) SCC 465, where this Court held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"202973\" id=\"span_3\">&quot;However, we must notice that in view of <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_28\">Section \n16</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1216959/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1960266/\" id=\"a_30\">13</a> of the Act, as \ninterpreted by the Constitution Bench of this Court \nin Konkan Rly. <a href=\"/doc/202973/\" id=\"a_31\">Corpn.

It \nwas further held that even in the old law, common sense approach \nalone was commended for being adopted in construing an arbitration \nclause more to perpetuate the intention of the parties to get their \ndisputes resolved through the alternate disputes redressal method of \narbitration rather than thwart it by adopting a narrow, pedantic and \nlegalistic interpretation.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">\tThe consistent view taken by this Court, therefore, is that \ncontentious issues should not be gone into or decided at the stage of \nappointment of an arbitrator and no time should be wasted in such an \nexercise.  The remedy of the aggrieved party is to raise an objection \nbefore the arbitral tribunal as under <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 16</a> of the Act it is \nempowered to rule about its own jurisdiction.  It is, therefore, open to \nthe plaintiff to raise all the pleas before defendant No. 2 including a \nplea that there is no arbitration agreement between the parties for \nreferring any dispute for arbitration before the Hindustan Chamber of \nCommerce, Mumbai.  It is also important to note that in response to \nthe notice issued by defendant No. 2 the plaintiff had sent a \ncommunication raising certain pleas and had also remitted an amount \nof Rs.200/- as fee for arbitration.  In such circumstances we are of the \nopinion that the view taken by the City Civil Court was just and \nproper and the High Court erred in granting an injunction in favour of \nthe plaintiff and staying the proceedings before defendant No. 2.\n\tThe other point, which needs consideration, is that the appellant \nhad raised a specific plea by moving an application under <a href=\"/doc/1673226/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 20</a> \nread with <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 151</a> CPC before the trial court that the court at \nCalcutta had no territorial jurisdiction to try the suit.  According to the \nappellant the indent (contract) contained a clause that the dispute \nunder the contract shall be decided by the court at Bombay and by no \nother court.  That apart it was defendant No. 1, which had commenced \narbitration proceedings before defendant No. 2 and both are situate in \nBombay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\tThe plaintiff wants that the Hindustan Chamber of Commerce \n(defendant No. 2) may be restrained from proceeding with arbitration \nof the dispute, which has been raised by the appellant Shree \nSubhlaxmi Fabrics Pvt. Ltd. (defendant No. 1).  Both defendant No. 1 \nand defendant No. 2 have their offices at Bombay.  Insofar as \ncommencement of proceedings before defendant No. 2 by defendant \nNo. 1 is concerned, no part of cause of action has accrued in Calcutta.\n\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1548537\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/1548537/\" id=\"a_37\">Hakam Singh vs. Gammon (India) Ltd.</a> 1971 (1) SCC 286, it \nhas been held that it is not open to the parties to confer by their \nagreement jurisdiction on a court which it does not possess under the \nCode.

Often the stipulation is that the \ncontract shall be deemed to have been made at a \nparticular place.  This would provide the \nconnecting factor for jurisdiction to the courts of \nthat place in the matter of any dispute on or arising \nout of that contract.  It would not, however, ipso \nfacto take away jurisdiction of other courts.  \nWhere an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see \nwhether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other \ncourts.  When the clause is clear, unambiguous and \nspecific accepted notions of contract would bind \nthe parties and unless the absence of ad idem can \nbe shown, the other courts should avoid exercising \njurisdiction.  As regards construction of ouster \nclause when words like &#x27;alone&#x27;, &#x27;only&#x27;, &#x27;exclusive&#x27; \nand the like have been used there may be no \ndifficulty.  Even without such words in appropriate \ncases the maxim &#x27;expressio unius est exclusion \nalterius&#x27; \u0016 expression of one is the exclusion of \nanother may be applied.  What is an appropriate \ncase shall depend on the facts of the case.  In such \na case mention of one thing may imply exclusion \nof another.  When certain jurisdiction is specified \nin a contract an intention to exclude all others from \nits operation may in such cases be inferred.  It has \ntherefore to be properly construed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"518433\" id=\"span_7\">This view has been reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/518433/\" id=\"a_41\">Angile Insulation vs. Davy \nAshmore India Ltd.</a> 1995 (4) SCC 153.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\tIn the case on hand the clause in the indent is very clear, viz., \n&quot;court of Bombay and no other court&quot;.
