The objection to the petitioner having addressed a Section 21\n                    notice prior to having attempted conciliation under Clause 26.2 cannot\n                    sustain, for more than one reason. Firstly, in the judgment of the\n                    Coordinate Bench in Gajendra Mishra, the view that has been\n                    adopted is that once the contract was terminated, the requirement of\n                    resorting to conciliation before seeking recourse to arbitration would\n                    not apply. No doubt<a href=\"/doc/57927439/\" id=\"a_2\">, <a href=\"/doc/57927439/\" id=\"a_3\">in that case</a></a>, it has also been noted that the\n                    Project Manager was not in existence after termination of contract\n                    whereas in the present case, Ms. Khorana&#x27;s submission is that\n                    Authority&#x27;s Engineer was not only in existence but that he had\n\n\n                     3 SAROD\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Signature Not Verified                                                                         Signature Not Verified</span>\n                     O.M.P.

That assurance,\n                    however, proved chimerical, as the attempt at conciliation was a\n                    complete failure, with no meeting having been convened by the\n                    respondent&#x27;s Chairman within seven days as required by Clause 26.2.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">                    19.    It cannot, therefore, be said that the petitioner was in default in\n                    attempting conciliation before resorting to arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">                    20.    In these circumstances, it would be pure futility to require the\n                    petitioner to once again address a representation to the respondent\n                    under Section 21 of the 1996 Act, seeking reference of the disputes to\n                    arbitration. The petitioner did issue such a notice on 26 December\n                    2023. The respondent, in its reply, denied all liability towards the\n                    petitioner, and instead alleged that the petitioner was in breach of the\n                    contract. The objection regarding want of notification of disputes by\n                    the petitioner has already been found to be without any substance. The\n                    suggestion that the dispute could be referred to conciliation was also\n                    found to be illusory as the petitioner did attempt reference of the\n                    disputes to conciliation under Clause 26.2 but it was the respondent&#x27;s\n                    Chairman who defaulted in convening the requested meeting within\n                    seven days, as envisaged by the Clause.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">                    21.

The objection of Ms. Khorana to the petitioner&#x27;s Section 21\n                    notice having predated the communication to the Chairman on 23\n                    March 2024, seeking conciliation of the dispute, is therefore, found to\n                    be without substance and is accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"750030\" id=\"span_11\">23.    The last objection of Ms. Khurana is that the arbitration was\n                    required to be conducted as per the rules of SAROD. Mr. Jain, learned\n                    counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is not a member\n                    of SAROD, and as membership of both the parties of SAROD is a\n                    prerequisite for arbitration as per the SAROD rules, the clause is\n                    unworkable. He places reliance on the following paragraphs from the\n                    judgment of a coordinate Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/750030/\" id=\"a_7\">Rani Constructions\n                    Pvt Ltd v UOI4</a>:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                           &quot;8.      It is the contention of the petitioner that since it is not a\n                           primary member of SAROD nor is it desirous of becoming a\n                           primary member of SAROD, it is not entitled to invoke the\n                           arbitration under SAROD Rules. As such, according to the\n                           petitioner, the procedure prescribed in the Arbitration Agreement\n                           for constituting the arbitral tribunal has become unworkable and it\n                           is in this light that the petitioner addressed the aforesaid letter dated\n                           15.02.2023 proposing that a three-member arbitral tribunal be\n                           constituted in terms of provision of the A&amp;C Act, 1996. However,\n                           the respondent vide letter dated 05.08.2023 asserted that the\n                           petitioner must invoke arbitration in accordance with SAROD\n                           Rules. The petitioner vide letter dated 22.08.2023 reiterated that\n                           since the primary membership of SAROD is pre-requisite for\n                           invocation under the SAROD Rules, it was not in a position to take\n                           recourse to the SAROD Rules.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                           9.      Ultimately, the petitioner filed the present petition seeking\n                           constitution of an arbitral tribunal. While issuing notice in the\n                           present petition, vide order dated 03.10.2023, it was specifically\n                           noticed as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                                     &quot;2.

On a specific query to the learned counsel for\n                                     SAROD as to whether SAROD is willing to make its panel\n                                     available for constitution of the arbitral tribunal, learned\n                                     counsel for SAROD submits that it will not possible for\n                                     SAROD to do so, without the petitioner taking membership\n                                     of SAROD.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">                           12.     In view of the above, it is evident that the contractual\n                           mechanism that is prescribed for constitution of arbitral tribunal as\n                           per SAROD Rules cannot be implemented unless and until both the\n                           petitioner and the respondent become members of SAROD.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">                           13.      In the aforesaid conspectus, the question that arises for\n                           consideration is whether an arbitral institution, whose rules have\n                           been adopted by the parties, and which has been entrusted with the\n                           task of constituting the arbitral tribunal, can insist that the parties to\n                           the arbitration agreement must take membership of the said\n                           institution, as a pre-condition for taking requisite steps in terms of\n                           the agreement between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">                           14.     Learned counsel for the petitioner is right in contending that\n                           the contractual stipulation whereby the parties agreed that the\n                           arbitration would be conducted as per the rules of arbitration of\n                           SAROD, did not carry with it an additional obligation that the\n                           parties would take primary membership of SAROD.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">                           15.    In the present case, the petitioner is willing to pay the\n                           applicable fee/charges to SAROD for the purpose of functions to\n                           be discharged by SAROD in terms of the arbitration agreement\n                           between the parties, however, it is not willing to take primary\n                           membership of SAROD.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">                           16.     I find merit in the contention of the petitioner that an\n                           arbitration agreement under which the parties agree on conducting\n                           arbitration as per rules of a particular arbitral institution, cannot be\n                           construed as subsuming within it, an additional obligation to\n                           become of that arbitral institution.

Such an obligation cannot be insisted as a prerequisite for\n                           taking recourse to arbitration. In the present case, insistence on the\n                           part of the SAROD that the parties must take membership of\n                           SAROD as a pre-condition for taking necessary steps to constitute\n                           an arbitral tribunal as per its rules, impinges on the validity of the\n                           appointment procedure; amounts to failure to perform the function\n                           entrusted to the concerned institute under the procedure agreed to\n                           by the parties, and consequently attracts <a href=\"/doc/1758564/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 11(6)(c)</a> of\n                           the A&amp;C Act, 1996 and making it incumbent on this Court to take\n                           requisite steps to constitute the arbitral tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">                           17.     Since SAROD rules cannot be applied to conduct of the\n                           arbitration between the parties in the present case for the aforesaid\n                           reason, and since the parties have not arrived at an agreement for\n                           constitution of three-member arbitral tribunal as proposed by the\n                           petitioner in notice dated 15.02.2023, it is incumbent on this Court\n                           to appoint a sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes between the\n                           parties.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">                    24.    I find myself in entire agreement with the view expressed by the\n                    Coordinate Bench in Rani Constructions. The Contract Agreement\n                    cannot be read as mandating that the petitioner should have become a\n                    member of the SAROD before the disputes between the parties were\n                    arbitrated.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">                    25.

Para 114 of the report specifically says that the court is to see\n                    nothing else. The only other aspect which the court has to bear in\n                    mind is whether the <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(6)</a> petition has been filed within three\n                    years of the <a href=\"/doc/138599/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 21</a> notice initiating the arbitral proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">                    27.    Both these conditions stand satisfied in the present case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">                    28.    Accordingly, as the parties have not been able to arrive at a\n                    consensus regarding arbitration, the Court has necessarily to step it\n                    and refer the disputes to arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                    29.
