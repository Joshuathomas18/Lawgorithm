I must herein also take note of the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/1979603/\" id=\"a_37\">Smt.\n           Rukmanibai Gupta</a> (supra), which has been relied upon by the\n           learned counsel for the defendants to contend that Clause 14 of the\n           Agreement dated 04.08.2017 shall amount to an Arbitration\n           Agreement between the parties. In the said case, however, the Court\n           was also influenced by the fact that the appellant therein had herself\n           unreservedly accepted that the Clause 15, which was in dispute\n           therein, spelled out an Arbitration Agreement between the parties.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">           18.      From a reading of the above judgments, it would be evident that\n           to constitute an Arbitration Agreement, the parties must have agreed\n           for the Arbitral Tribunal to determine the rights of the parties in an\n           impartial and judicial manner, with the Tribunal owing an equal\n           obligation of fairness towards both sides. The Tribunal has to act\n           judicially after taking into account relevant evidence and submissions\n           made by the parties before it. One must examine the true intent and\n           purport of the Agreement and though the presence or absence of the\n           words „Arbitrator‟, „Arbitral Tribunal‟, „Arbitration‟ may be\n           persuasive, but are not always conclusive to determine the question\n           whether the Clause amounts to an Arbitration Agreement between the\n           parties. Apart from an Arbitral Tribunal, the parties may have, by\n           consent, empowered a body to also consider the disputes between\n           them in a ministerial and not a judicial manner like an expert (for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">Digitally Signed By:SUNIL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Signing Date:28.03.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">01:29:47      CS(COMM) 2/2022                                                         Page 12 of 13</span>\n                                 Neutral Citation Number: 2023:DHC:2127\n\n\n           example in the case of K.K. Modi) or as an in-house dispute resolution\n           mechanism, like in the present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">           19.      In my opinion, therefore, Clause 14 of the Agreement dated\n           04.08.2017 does not amount to an Arbitration Agreement between the\n           parties. It merely provides for an in-house escalation of the disputes to\n           the Director General, All India Radio (DG,AIR), however, it cannot\n           curtail the right of the plaintiff to institute a Civil Suit in case the\n           plaintiff is aggrieved of the decision of the said authority, that is, DG,\n           AIR. The Agreement is executed with the DG, AIR being one of the\n           parties thereto.      The parties to the Agreement could never have\n           intended to make one of them to act as an impartial dispute\n           adjudicator/arbitrator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">           20.
