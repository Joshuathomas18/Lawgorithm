It is stated that\n                         petitioner no. 2 (Margo Networks Pvt. Ltd. - hereinafter &#x27;Margo&#x27;) had\n                         submitted its bid pursuant to the RFP and was declared successful.\n                         Thereafter, RailTel issued a Letter of Award (LoA) dated 14.01.2020\n                         awarding the contract to Margo.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">                         3.     In terms of the RFP, it was agreed that the contract to provide\n                         COD Services would be for a term of ten years. The contract was on\n                         revenue sharing basis whereby Margo had agreed to share revenue from\n                         the COD Services subject to payment of an Annual Minimum\n                         Guarantee amount (hereafter &#x27;MG&#x27;).

The\n                         parties agreed that for the second year, the MG amount would be\n                         increased to the revenue shared during the last applicable financial year\n                         if the same was higher than 50% of the MG.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                         4.     Petitioner no.1 (hereafter &#x27;ZEEL&#x27;) is the holding company of\n                         Margo and had furnished the subject Bank Guarantee bearing BG No-\n                         240GT02201040006 dated 09.04.2020 issued by respondent no.2\n                         (HDFC Bank) for an amount of ₹37.17 Crores (hereafter referred to as\n                         &#x27;the BG in question&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">                         5.     Margo states that after issuance of the BG in question, it had sent\n                         several emails to the Northern Railways with regard to implementation\n                         of the contract to provide COD Services in various trains.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">                         6.     Margo states that it had also exchanged correspondence with\n                         RailTel in regard to the Performance Bank Guarantee from March, 2020\n                         onwards. The petitioners (ZEEL and Margo) contend that their\n                         resources were severely constrained in view of the nationwide\n                         lockdown imposed with effect from 23.03.2020, on account of Covid-\n                         19 pandemic. Margo also claims that there were significant delays on\n                         the part of RailTel on account of delay in receiving permission from the\n                         Railways for implementing the COD Services on various trains.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">                         7.     Margo made various requests for deferment/waiver of the MG\n                         payments but the said request was not entertained and RailTel continued\n                         to raise invoices for the MG amount and the interest charges thereon.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                         OMP (I) (COMM) 366/2021                                      Page 3 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">RAWAL</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">                          8.     Margo states that it paid the MG for the first year along with the\n                         interest in terms of the RFP. The controversy between the parties is in\n                         respect of the MG payment for the second year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">                         9.     Margo states that RailTel did not accept any of its proposals,\n                         however, agreed to defer the payment of the balance 50% of the first\n                         year&#x27;s MG till 01.03.2021 and the second year&#x27;s MG till 31.03.2021.\n                         The petitioners state that in the given compelling circumstances, Margo\n                         furnished the undertaking on 10.02.2021 as desired by RailTel and\n                         undertook to ensure the MG payments to RailTel in accordance with the\n                         terms and conditions of the LoA issued on 14.01.2020. In view of the\n                         said undertaking, RailTel also agreed to extend the term of the contract\n                         for a further period of one year, till 13.01.2031.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">                         10.    However, on 09.07.2021, Margo sent a letter stating that its\n                         earlier undertaking was null and void in wake of the second wave of\n                         Covid-19 pandemic and it sought further deferment of the MG\n                         payments as well as extension of the term of the contract in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">                         11.    RailTel did not accept the same and, by a letter dated 05.08.2021,\n                         withdrew its agreement to extend the term of the contract for further\n                         period of one year as Margo had not complied with the terms of its\n                         undertaking. RailTel referred to various clauses of the RFP and further\n                         called upon Margo to pay the second MG by 16.08.2021 and also put\n                         Margo to notice that in case of non-compliance, RailTel would be left\n                         with no option but take action including forfeiture of the Earnest Money\n                         Deposit (EMD) in terms of Clause 2.24.1.3 of Section II of the RFP\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                         OMP (I) (COMM) 366/2021                                     Page 4 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">RAWAL</span>\n                          and, to terminate the Contract on account of occurrence of an Event of\n                         Default as contemplated under Clause 3.29 of the RFP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">                         12.    Margo responded to the said notice by a letter dated 10.08.2021\n                         and claimed that it had not violated any terms of the RFP and there was\n                         no amount due and payable by it because there was no contract in force\n                         between the parties. Margo claimed that the timeline for payment of the\n                         first year&#x27;s MG and the timelines for payment of MGs for the further\n                         period would trigger only on execution of the Agreement and in absence\n                         thereof it was not liable to pay the second year&#x27;s MG.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">                         13.    By a letter dated 11.11.2021, RailTel terminated the contract\n                         between the parties and called upon Margo to comply with the Exit\n                         Management Schedule under Section III of the RFP. RailTel also issued\n                         a letter dated 11.11.2021 to HDFC Bank invoking the Bank Guarantee\n                         in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">                         14.    In the aforesaid context, the petitioners have filed the present\n                         petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">                         Submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">                         15.    Mr Jain, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners\n                         contended that the invocation of the BG in question was liable to be\n                         interdicted in view of the Force Majeure event of the outbreak of\n                         Covid-19. He referred to Clause 3.25 of the General Conditions of\n                         Contract (GCC) and on the strength of the Sub-clause (ii) of Clause 3.25\n                         of the GCC submitted that an outbreak of a pandemic would constitute\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                         OMP (I) (COMM) 366/2021                                    Page 5 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">RAWAL</span>\n                          a Force Majeure event.

He submitted that the pandemic is still raging and\n                         therefore, Margo is absolved of performance of its obligations in terms\n                         of the LOA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                         16.    He further submitted that in terms of Clause 3.25 (h) of the GCC,\n                         the parties had agreed that in case of Force Majeure, all parties were\n                         obliged to endeavour to agree on an alternate mode of performance in\n                         order to ensure continuity of the service and implementation of the\n                         obligations as well as to minimise any adverse consequences of Force\n                         Majeure.

At the outset, it is necessary to note that there is no dispute that\n                         the BG in question is an unconditional bank guarantee. The law relating\n                         to interdicting an unconditional bank guarantee is now far too well\n                         settled. It has been authoritatively held by the Supreme Court in several\n                         cases that the bank guarantees can be interdicted only in exceptional\n                         cases of egregious fraud and special equities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                         22.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_41\">In <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_9\">U.P.

K. Jagannatha Shetty J. in his concurring opinion had further\n                         explained as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                     &quot;53. Whether it is a traditional letter of credit or a\n                                     new device like performance bond or performance\n                                     guarantee, the obligation of banks appears to be the\n                                     same. If the documentary credits are irrevocable and\n                                     independent, the banks must pay when demand is\n                                     made. Since the bank pledges its own credit\n                                     involving its reputation, it has no defence except in\n                                     the case of fraud. The bank&#x27;s obligations of course\n                                     should not be extended to protect the unscrupulous\n                                     seller, that is, the seller who is responsible for the\n                                     fraud. But, the banker must be sure of his ground\n                                     before declining to pay. The nature of the fraud that\n                                     the courts talk about is fraud of an &quot;egregious nature\n                                     as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction&quot;. It is\n                                     fraud of the beneficiary, not the fraud of somebody\n                                     else. If the bank detects with a minimal investigation\n                                     the fraudulent action of the seller, the payment could\n                                     be refused. The bank cannot be compelled to honour\n                                     the credit in such cases. But it may be very difficult\n                                     for the bank to take a decision on the alleged\n                                     fraudulent action.

The\n                                           bank giving such a guarantee is bound to\n                                           honour it as per its terms irrespective of\n                                           any dispute raised by its customer. The\n                                           very purpose of giving such a bank\n                                           guarantee would otherwise be defeated.\n                                           The courts should, therefore, be slow in\n                                           granting an injunction to restrain the\n                                           realization of such a bank guarantee. The\n                                           courts have carved out only two\n                                           exceptions. A fraud in connection with\n                                           such a bank guarantee would vitiate the\n                                           very foundation of such a bank\n                                           guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud\n                                           of which the beneficiary seeks to take\n                                           advantage, he can be restrained from\n                                           doing so.

The legal position which can be\n                                     summarized would be that a bank guarantee is an\n                                     independent contract between the bank and the\n                                     beneficiary and disputes pertaining to bank\n                                     guarantees have to be resolved de-hors the terms\n                                     of the main contract between the parties or\n                                     disputes relatable to the main contract between the\n                                     parties. Where a bank guarantee is a conditional\n                                     guarantee invocation thereof would have to be in\n                                     strict conformity with the conditions on which the\n                                     guarantee is issued. In such a case an injunction\n                                     can be granted against payment under the bank\n                                     guarantee if it is found that the condition upon\n                                     which the guarantee was issued has not been\n                                     complied with or met.

There are, however, two exceptions to this\n                                     rule.

The\n                         said judgment is not an authority for the proposition that the principles\n                         as authoritatively settled by the Supreme Court in various decisions\n                         mentioned above have been diluted or no longer held good.

The Division Bench had specifically noted that the courts have\n                         granted injunction on the grounds of special equities where there were\n                         extraordinary circumstances and the same &quot;include cases of\n                         irretrievable injury, extraordinary special equities including the\n                         impossibility of the guarantor being reimbursed at a later stage if found\n                         entitled to the money and the invocation of the BG being not in terms of\n                         the BG itself. &quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">                         33.    It is well settled that in cases where invocation of the bank\n                         guarantee is not in terms of the bank guarantee, the courts would\n                         intervene and would interdict payment against such an invocation. This\n                         is not a case of special equities but constitutes a sperate ground. The\n                         concept of irretrievable injury or extraordinary special equities cannot\n                         be expanded to take into its fold disputes regarding the interpretation or\n                         performance of the underlying contract.

The High\n                                     Court seems to have come to the conclusion that\n                                     the termination of the contract by the appellant and\n                                     his claim that time was of the essence of the\n                                     contract, are not based on the terms of the contract\n                                     and, therefore, there is a fraud in the invocation of\n                                     the bank guarantee. This is an erroneous view. The\n                                     disputes between the parties relating to the\n                                     termination of the contract cannot make invocation\n                                     of the bank guarantees fraudulent..&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">                                                              [underlined for emphasis]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                         35.
