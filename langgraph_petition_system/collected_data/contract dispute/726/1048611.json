The petitioner has applied to the first respondent for dealership in petroleum products and the petitioner was selected and a lease agreement in respect of the land was executed in favour of the first respondent under a registered deed, dated 07.02.2005 for a period of 30 years.  The rent was fixed at Rs.6,000/- per month. The dealership was awarded on 01.10.2004 in respect of the supply of petroleum products made by the respondents to be sold by the petitioner in retail outlet. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\tb)It is stated that on 14.05.2008, there was an inspection in the retail outlet of the petitioner and the Sales Officer of the respondent Corporation has inspected to ascertain as to whether, there is any stock variation within permissible limit. On finding that the stock variation in power and turbojet was beyond permissible limit and a report was stated to have been given by the Sales Officer and the outlet pumps of power and turbojet were sealed and sales was stopped in the above two nozzles. Thereafter, notice was sent to the petitioner on 31.05.2008 by the first respondent stating as if inspection was conducted on 04.05.2008 which was factually wrong and in the notice it was stated that in respect of power and turbojet the stock variation were beyond permissible limits, L&amp;T, MS Nozzle was delivering 30ml short and L&amp;T HSD Nozzle delivering 30ml excess, and while the sales from the above nozzles were suspended, 999 litres of power was pumped through nozzle in a single transaction.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\tc)The petitioner has replied to the said notice on 11.06.2008 stating that the load was received on 05.05.2008, there was a shortage of 189 litres and the same was reported to the first respondent and that has also been included in the variation, otherwise the variation should be treated as within permissible limit. In respect of turbojet also it is informed that while the load was received on 10.05.2008, there was a shortage of 239 litres and that has not been included in addition to 105 litres as testing.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\td)It is also stated that since the retail outlet is in the border of Tamil Nadu, sale was also effected by can as well as barrel. Therefore, the continuous pumping of 999 litres through nozzle in a single transaction is possible. However, the said charge was also denied. By referring to the Marketing Discipline Guidelines, it was replied by the petitioner that there was a permissible variation. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\te)It is stated that after the explanation submitted there was no action, even though the supply was suspended to the petitioner. Therefore, the petitioner has approached this Court by filing W.P.No.14983 of 2008 for a direction to resume supply of Power, Turbojet, MS and HSD fuels to the petitioner. Considering the argument of both the parties, this Court by an order, dated 04.09.2008, disposed of the writ petition giving liberty to the respondents to pass final orders pursuant to the show cause notice, by considering the explanation offered by the petitioner, dated 11.06.2008. By a letter dated 30.09.2008, the first respondent stating it as a fact finding letter directed the petitioner to appear for hearing on 24.09.2008, on which day, the petitioner has reiterated the earlier reply, dated 11.06.2008 and 26.08.2008.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\tf)It is stated that in terms of the order of this Court, dated 04.09.2008, when the sales officer one Thiru.Kirubanandam has visited the retail outlet for resuming the sale, it was found that there was  positive stock variation to the extent of 1446 litres in power, 106 litres in HSD and 300 litres in turbojet      and there was density variation in power to the extent of 3.4 between the density recorded on 14.05.2008 and the density observed at the time of inspection on 26.09.2008, even after the suspension of the supply. On such finding, the sale was not resumed and the samples were drawn and sent to the lab for testing. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\tg)It is stated that for the letter, dated 30.09.2008, the petitioner was not able to reply since  the writ petition was pending before this Court as stated above. The first respondent filed an affidavit on 29.09.2008 alleging that certain stock variation and density variation. Based on that affidavit, the matter was posted again for being mentioned before this Court and adjourned for filing counter affidavit to the said affidavit by the petitioner. It was in those circumstances, reply could not be given to the letter of the first respondent, dated 30.09.2008. In the mean time, the first respondent has served the impugned final order, dated 10.10.2008 terminating the dealership agreement, dated 01.10.2004 stating that the petitioner has not stated anything new and also stating that the petitioner is free  to invoke the clause under dealership agreement for arbitration. \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\t4.The said impugned order is challenged on various grounds including that it is arbitrary,  illegal and perverse; that the order has been passed without substantial evidence and therefore, the  examination of parties are only an empty formality and in effect is in violation of the principles of natural justice; that even though it is a long order, the impugned order is passed on non application of mind; that the order is mala fide; that the non giving of reply was due to the pendency of the case which was reopened only at the instance of the first respondent, that the allegation of variation is false and perverse and the same is a permissible variation, if it is taken in its proper perspective and so on.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">\t5.The first respondent has filed counter affidavit on behalf of the respondent Corporation. A preliminary objection was raised on the ground that the agreement, dated 01.10.2004 has contained a clause for arbitration and in view of the arbitration clause, the writ petition is not maintainable. The further objection is raised about the maintainability of the writ petition that the contractual obligations under the agreement is said to be enforced in the writ petition.  On the merit, it is also stated that sales officer of the respondent Corporation has inspected on 04.05.2008 and found that stock variation in power and turbojet were beyond permissible limits and was delivering 30ml short and L&amp;T HSD Nozzle delivering 30ml excess and it was immediately, thereafter, the supplies were suspended.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\tii)It is further stated that on a close review of the sales from January 2008 it was found various violations that nozzle sales of High Speed Diesel ranges from 1200 to 2000 litres per day and that of Motor Spirit, it is 428 especially during midnights  High Speed Diesel ranging from 4000 to 8000 litres and about 4000 litres in case of Motor Spirit have been pumped through nozzles. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\tiii)It was found that 999 litres of power was pumped through nozzle in a single transaction; that the daily sales recorded in DSR is highly incongruous with the daily sales as per automation data source and the abnormal high sale volumes on specific days does not commensurate with the daily average sales and the petitioner was not capturing the vehicle numbers of all the vehicles in automated system as advised.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\tiv)It is due to the reason that there are violations and irregularities in respect of stock variation, as per the dealership agreement, proceedings were initiated. Immediately, after giving explanation to the show cause notice, the dealer has approached this Court by filing writ petition for a direction to resume supply of power. It was in the writ petition on 04.09.2008, the Corporation was directed to pass final orders on the show cause notice issued, considering the explanation directing the supply of petroleum products to the dealer. It was thereafter, a personal enquiry was conducted calling upon Mr.A.Senthil Kumar, Proprietor of the petitioner, to be present in person, on 24.09.2008 with his explanation to the show cause notice, dated 11.08.2008 and also produce documents. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\tv)It is stated that on 24.09.2008, the said person along with his Manager T.Babu appeared at 11 a.m. and he has explained in detail the contents of his letters dated 11.08.2008 and 26.08.2008 and a detailed enquiry was held on the said date in which the said Mr.A.Senthil Kumar has signed the proceedings. It was pursuant to the order of the Court, dated 04.09.2008, directing the Corporation to supply petroleum products, the Sales officer, Sri.D.Kirubanandam went to the retail outlet of the petitioner on 26.09.2008 and on inspection irregularities were again found especially, there was  density variation in power between the density recorded on 14.05.2008 and as observed at the time of inspection on 26.09.2008 and there was also positive stock variation of motor spirit, such variation was found inspite of non supply from the Corporation and therefore, the Corporation was unable to resume supply and it was in those circumstances, the matter was brought to the notice of this Court in the above said writ petition &#x27;for being mentioned&#x27; on 30.09.2008 and the matter was subsequently adjourned to 15.10.2008 at the request of the learned counsel for the petitioner.  The letter of termination was sent by registered post on 10.10.2008, which was given effect from 11.10.2008 and based on the Panchanama prepared possession of the retail outlet was taken over by the first respondent Corporation has resumed sale by itself. The said writ petition was closed since in the mean time, the termination order has been passed. While it is admitted that lease was for a period of 30 years commencing from 07.02.2005 on a monthly rental of Rs.6,000/- and renewal thereafter, it is stated that the dealership agreement is different from land lease agreement. It is stated that the conduct of the petitioner has been not in accordance with the contract for which many warning letters were issued by the Corporation. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\tvi)It is stated that while the inspection was carried out on 14.05.2008 by the Sales Officer by mistake it was stated as 04.05.2008 in one of the communication which is a clerical error. It is stated that as a dealer, the petitioner is aware that the shortage is to be recorded in the daily sales register and said record was not made, thereby no mistake committed by the sales officer in including addition of 57 litres as testing. The testing was done as per the Marketing Discipline Guidelines. It is stated that no shortage was booked in the daily sales record and no variations were seen at the end of the same day as well as specific days in daily sale record despite excess delivery. Again it is denied that in respect of turbojet, there was a mistake committed by the sales officer that he did not include an addition of 105 litres as a testing. In respect of the statement of the petitioner that the bunk situated at the Pondicherry border and therefore, the sale could be effected by cans because of the price difference between the two States and according to the respondents, the same is liable for prosecution  since it is against the Petroleum Rules and the Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel Control Order, 2005.  It is further stated that it was only after opportunity having been given by issuing show cause notice and considering the explanation of the petitioner, the impugned order came to be passed and it was only the petitioner who has rushed to this Court by filing W.P.No.14983 of 2008 even before the explanation could be considered by the first respondent and non resumption of supply was due to the fault committed again by the petitioner during the time when there was no supply and the stock density were observed to be contrary and therefore,  resumption of sale was not possible.  It is also stated that there is no personal animosity with the petitioner and it was only because of the violation of the provisions of the licence, the impugned order came to be passed after giving due opportunity to the petitioner and following the guidelines.  It is also denied that the termination order is arbitrary or illegal and there is absolutely no violation of principles of natural justice in this case and only after enquiry the order came to be passed. It is only stated that there is no necessity to furnish any of the documents and no opportunity need to be given to cross examine any of the witnesses and if such requirement is made by the petitioner, remedy is available to the petitioner by invoking arbitration clause under the dealership agreement and there was no proper explanation given by the petitioner to the gross violations against the guidelines. It is also denied that there is mala fide on the part of the respondent Corporation towards the petitioner.\tIt is stated that the petitioner having committed gross violation of the conditions of licence is attempting to justify the same by making various allegations in this writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">\t6.Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that when  gross allegation has been made against the petitioner which cannot be in normal circumstance accepted especially when the supply was stopped thereby it was found that there was a variation in density which may be due to the reason of long gap, it is the duty on the part of the first respondent to conduct proper enquiry and without any evidence, the termination order came to be passed.  It is his further submission that even though there is an arbitration clause available, there is a gross violation of the principles of natural justice. On the part of the first respondent which is a governmental organisation and therefore, the first respondent cannot wriggle out saying that the writ petition is not maintainable. He would further submit that even in matters of contract, if there is a gross violation of principles of natural justice, the writ petition is maintainable. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1603548\" id=\"span_1\">7.He would rely upon the judgment reported in 2003 (1) CTC 189 (<a href=\"/doc/1603548/\" id=\"a_2\">Harbanslal Sahnia and another Vs.

There was no finding in stock testing which has been forwarded to the petitioner and it is his submission that as per the guidelines there was permissible limit and therefore, the finding is perverse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">\t9.It is the further submission of Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan, the learned Senior Counsel that the facts of each case are different and to substantiate his contention that the filing of writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is not a bar, he also relied on the judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court as well as this Court: \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1571430\" id=\"span_5\">\u0013i)In <a href=\"/doc/1571430/\" id=\"a_7\">Agri Gold Exims Ltd., Vs.

Even though the impugned order explains in detail, the case of the petitioner is that inasmuch as the relevant issue has not been discussed, it should be taken as an order passed with non application of mind.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">\t15.Before going into the rival submissions made by the respective counsels it is necessary to refer to some of the Clauses of the dealership agreement, dated 01.10.2004 which has been terminated by the first respondent under the impugned order. It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner itself is a lease holder in respect of the land and as a lease holder, the petitioner entered into an agreement with the first respondent which is for the purpose of making the petitioner as a dealer for the retail sale or supply at the said premises of petrol/Diesel/motor oils/greases and such other products. Therefore, we are concerned in this writ petition about the dealership agreement and the period of dealership agreement is 15 years.  As per the terms of the agreement, the site has to be maintained by the dealer at his own expenses apart from the equipments prescribed in the schedule and the corporation should supply such quantities of the products as may be considered expedient to meet the current trade demands and it is the duty of the dealer to maintain stocks as the Corporation may consider adequate. The sale target is also mentioned in Clause 9 of the said agreement. There are various conditions stipulated against the dealer in respect of the sale of the petroleum products supplied by the Corporation with the power of the Corporation to inspect the retail outlet at any point of time and that the dealer has to keep and maintain records of sale etc.,\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">\t16.Clause 55 of the contract empowers the Corporation to terminate the agreement on any one of the grounds which includes the breach of any of the covenants and stipulations contained in the agreement, the death or adjudication as insolvent of the dealer or on dissolution of partnership or liquidation of the company to which the dealership was given, when default made in payment to the Corporation, if the dealer fails to adhere the instructions issued from time to time and if there is contamination or tampering of the quality of the products supplied by the corporation etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">\t17.Clause 66 of the said agreement which provides for settlement of dispute by arbitration stands as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t\u001366.Any dispute or difference of any nature whatsoever or regarding any right, liability, act omission or account of any of the parties hereto arising out of or in relation to this agreement shall be referred to the sole arbitration of the Managing Director of the Corporation or of some officer of the Corporation who may be nominated by the Managing Director. The dealer will not be entitled to raise any objection to any such arbitrator on the ground that the arbitrator is an officer of the Corporation or that he has to deal with the matters to which the contract relates or that in the course of his duties as an officer of the Corporation he had expressed views on all or any of the matters in dispute or difference. In the event of the arbitrator to whom the matter is originally referred being transferred or vacating his office or being unable to act for any reason the Managing Director as aforesaid at the time of such transfer, vacation of office or inability to act, shall designate another person to act as arbitrator in accordance with the terms of the agreement such person shall be entitled to proceed with the reference from the point at which it was left by his predecessor. It is also a term of this contract that no person other than the Managing Director or a person nominated by such Managing Director of the Corporation as aforesaid shall act as Arbitrator hereunder. The award of the Arbitrator so appointed shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties to the agreement, subject to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_30\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> or any statutory modification of or re-enactment thereof and the rules made thereunder and for the time being in force shall apply to the arbitration proceedings under this clause.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">\tThe award shall be made in writing within six months after entering upon the reference or within such extended time not exceeding further four months as the sole Arbitrator shall by a writing under his own hands appoint\u0014.\n</p>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">\t18.In respect of the implementation of the said dealership licence agreement before issuing the show cause notice which was on 11.08.2008, it is seen that the Corporation has done certain preliminary inspection as it is seen in the inspection report dated 24.01.2008 and the inspection report of the Field Officer has been signed by the representative of the dealer namely, the petitioner. It is seen that at least in two invoices dated 05.05.2008 and 10.05.2008, the representative of the petitioner has admitted the variation regarding the shortage of 189 litres in respect of power and 239 litres in respect of turbojet. The inspection report at the preliminary stage filed by the respondent&#x27;s official shows that they were all conducted in the presence of the representative of the petitioner.  By a letter dated 31.05.2008, based on the preliminary inspection of the Sales Officer, dated 04.05.2008 by comparing the sale effected in the retail outlet from January 2008, the first respondent has informed the petitioner to explain for the defects which was elicited as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t\u0013The nozzle sales of HSD ranges from 1200 to 2000 lts per day (24 hours) and that of MS it is 428 to 1000 lts. However, it was observed that the quite often the HSD sales during midnights (between 1000 hrs to 0130 hrs, the nozzles sales ranges from 4000 to 8000 lts. in case of HSD and about 4000 in case of MS.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">\tSimilarly, the normal nozzle sales ranges from 428 to 1000 lts in case of Power and 354 to 890 lts. in case of Turbojet. However, on many days, between 1000 hrs to 0130 hrs., the sales of Power &amp; Turbojet pumped through nozzles is recorded in the range of 1 Kl to 4 KL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\tIt was also observed that 999 litres of Power was pumped through nozzle in a single transaction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\tThe daily sales recorded in DSR is highly incongruence with the Daily sales as per Automation Data source.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\tThe abnormal high sales volumes on specific days does not commensurate with the daily average sales and does not commensurate with the vehicle movement study of your trading area at midnights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\tYou are not capturing the vehicle numbers of all the vehicles in automated system as advised\u0014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">\t19.It is true that the petitioner has given a reply on 11.06.2008 finding fault with the report of the Sales Officer of the Corporation in having committed certain mistakes and it was thereafter a detailed show cause notice came to be issued on 11.08.2008 bringing to the notice of the petitioner that irregularities have been committed in violation of the Clause Nos.16, 42, 55(A), and 55(K) of the agreement, dated 01.10.2004 and the show cause notice is for the purpose of taking action for the violation of the condition of the dealership agreement and that has been explained by the petitioner in its explanation, dated 26.08.2008. In the writ petition filed by the petitioner for a direction to resume supply after the show cause notice and the reply given by the petitioner as stated above, in the order dated 04.09.2008, while holding that it is for the first respondent Corporation to decide whether there is a stock variation and  finding that at this stage it was not possible to hold that either the stand of the corporation is correct or the stand of the petitioner is correct, the following order was passed:\n</p>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\t\u001311.Considering the above facts and circumstances, I am inclined to pass the following order:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\ta)The respondents are at liberty to pass final orders on the issuance of show cause notice to the petitioner after considering the explanation that has been offered by the petitioner dated 11.06.2008. The final order could be passed by the first respondent after hearing the petitioner, on merits and in accordance with law, within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">\tb)The respondents shall forthwith supply the Petroleum products to the petitioner;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">\tc)If the final order is against the petitioner, the respondent Corporation is at liberty to impose the penal action as per the rules and procedures contemplated thereon\u0014.\n</blockquote>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">Even after the said order was passed wherein a direction was given to restore the supply in addition to the permission granted to the first respondent to pass final orders on the basis of the show cause notice and explanation submitted by the petitioner,  the inspection report of the Field Officer of the first respondent Corporation as counter signed by the  representative of the petitioner shows that there has been a stock variation and therefore, the resumption could not be effected. In fact, endorsement in the said Field Officer&#x27;s report, dated 26.09.2008 itself, gives the reason by taking samples for non resumption of sale as per the direction of this Court which are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">\t\u0013Inspection carried out for the purpose of resuming sales as per directions of Court order. However, it is found\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">\ti)there is positive variation in stocks MS=Ml Power=1446 Ltrs HSD =106 lts &amp; in Turbojet = 300 ltrs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">\tii)There is variation in density of power beyond permissible limits.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">\tDealer to explain the variation for the above to SRM, CHRRO for further action\u0014.\n</p>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">\t20.The issue is as to whether the endorsement made by the Field Officer about variations which were found on fact during the time of inspection or its correctness could be decided by this Court especially in its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India by exchange of affidavits is highly doubtful. But the relevant point is that even after that inspection report of the Field Officer, the first respondent has given another opportunity to the petitioner on 30.09.2008 directing the petitioner to be present for a personal enquiry on the basis of a finding arrived at by the Field Officer on the date of inspection. It was, in those circumstances, after an enquiry, the first respondent having come to the conclusion that there has been a violation committed by the petitioner in respect of various Clauses of the agreement has terminated the dealership agreement. In the impugned order after termination, the first respondent has enabled the petitioner to resort to arbitrary proceedings as per Clause 66, which is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">\t\u0013Should you have any dispute or difference arising out of or in relation to the Dealership Agreement, Dt.01.10.2004 you are free to invoke Clause 66 of the Dealership Agreement for its adjudication through the process of Arbitration, as already agreed between us. The Arbitrator is already named in the aforesaid clause of the Dealership Agreement. Please note if you bring any action in any Court, the same shall not be maintainable as being barred under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_32\">Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and it shall be vehemently contested at your cost\u0014.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">Therefore, on the face of it, it is clear that the petitioner has a right to invoke arbitration clause even as on date. \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">\t21.The factual assertions as to whether the inspection conducted by the Field Officer on 26.09.2008 wherein on fact he stated to have found irregularities in stock variation and its correctness certainly requires appreciation of evidence apart from various factual assertions especially when the claim and counter claim made namely that it is the petitioner&#x27;s case that there is no stock variation and even if there is a stock variation the same is within the permissible limit, while it is the case of the respondent Corporation that there is a gross violation of Clauses of the dealership agreement. Such factual assertions cannot be gone into by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India especially when the issue involved is purely contractual as to whether the petitioner has acted against the terms of the contract. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">\t22.As far as the violation of principles of natural justice is concerned, the above facts show that on the face of it, there is no violation of the principles of natural justice in the conduct of the first respondent Corporation before passing the impugned order of termination. Inspite of it, it is the case of the petitioner that inspection was not conducted or enquiry was not effected by following the various technical aspects of quality and quantity of the materials supplied and even that aspect cannot be gone into in the writ jurisdiction which requires a detailed factual study with a technical expertise. It is only with that idea the concept of arbitration has been introduced in such agreement. So as to enable both the disputing parties to ventilate their grievances in full form, so as to have a substantial remedy and such remedy cannot be given by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1603548\" id=\"span_27\">23.The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1603548/\" id=\"a_35\">Harbanslal Sahnia and another Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd., and others</a> reported in 2003 (1) CTC 189  relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, while considering the similar issue in respect of termination of dealership agreement with the Indian Oil Corporation Limited, has allowed the appeal filed by the dealer on the ground that the termination was on irrelevant and non existent grounds and the sample tests for quality and density was not done in the presence of the dealer and in the context that there was a probability that the corporation having failed to satisfy with the explanation furnished by the dealer has terminated on different ground and in those circumstances, it was held that mere existence of arbitration clause is not one of compulsion and it is a rule of discretion by the Court while exercising writ jurisdiction holding that under 3 contingencies even in contractual matters the writ petition could be entertained in the following paragraphs as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">\t5.It is submitted by Shri P.P. Malhotra, the learned senior counsel for the appellants that the dealership has been terminated on irrelevant and non-existent grounds and, therefore, the order of termination is liable to be set aside. The Government of Uttar Pradesh have issued directions to all the District Magistrates of the State in the matter of taking of samples and carrying out tests. There are two Government Orders issued namely No. 1459/29-7-97-731-PP dated 25.4.1997 and No. 2722/29-7-2000-PP/2000. The orders state inter alia that the strength/frictions of petrol and diesel change after ten days and therefore time limit of ten days is fixed for testing of such products. It is also emphasized that in the interest of natural justice, the inspecting officials should test the sample for quality and density at the retail outlet itself in the presence of the dealer with necessary equipments such a filter paper, hydrometer, thermometer, jar and the conversion table which are available at the retail outlets and record density thereat only in the presence of the dealer. These government orders were violated in respect of the sample taken on 11.2.2000. Firstly, the test was not carried out at the retail outlet itself and, secondly, the time gap between the sample taken and lab test carried out is of about a month which is capable of causing marginal variation as detected. The learned senior counsel for the appellants invited attention of the Court to an order dated 24.10.2002 passed by the Commissioner, Nainital in an appeal prefer red against the suspension of petitioners? licence which too was founded on the test report of the sample taken on 11.2.2000. Impressed by non-compliance with the instructions contained in the government orders and the delay in carrying out the lab tests, also keeping in view the previous performance of the petitioners, the learned Commissioner has allowed the appeal and set aside the suspension as also the fine imposed on the petitioners. The learned counsel is right in submitting that in view of the abovesaid facts, the failure of the sample taken from the appellants? outlet on 11.2.2000 becomes an irrelevant and non-existent fact which could not have been relied on by the respondent-Corporation for canceling the appellants? licence .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">\t6.As already stated, the cancellation is founded solely on the failure of the appellants? sample. Non-cooperation and discourteous behaviour of the appellants has been alleged in a very general way without specifying what was non-cooperation and what was the discourtesy shown to the officers of the respondent-Corporation. The deficiency in sales is also generally stated without particularising the same. So in the case with deficiency in maintaining the records. Be that as it may, these are the grounds wh ich formed the subject matter of the earlier show cause notice which was not persuaded. In all probability, the respondent-Corporation felt satisfied with the explanation furnished by the appellants. The order of termination is certainly not founded on these grounds and, therefore, this aspect need not be pursued further. It may be stated that the appellants have volunteered to file a statement made on affidavit during the course of hearing before this Court, expressing regrets for any incident of departure from normal behaviour and courtesy expected of the appellants towards the officials of the respondent-Corporation and submitting that it might have happened inadvertently but in future the appellants would be more careful and shall show full regards to the visiting officials of the respondent-Corporation and extend their full cooperation in their dealings with the respondent. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1885496\" id=\"span_28\">7.So far as the view taken by the High Court that the remedy by way of recourse to arbitration clause was available to the appellants and therefore the writ petition filed by the appellants was liable to be dismissed, suffice it to observe that the rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of compulsion. In an appropriate case, in spite of availability of the alternative remedy, the High Court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least three contingencies; (i) where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights; (ii) where there is failure of principles of natural justice or, (iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act and is challenged. See <a href=\"/doc/1885496/\" id=\"a_36\">Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai and others</a> , 1998 (8) SCC 1. The present case attracts applicability of first two contingencies. Moreover, as noted, the petitioners? dealership, which is their bread and butter, came to be terminated for an irrelevant and non-existent cause. In such circumstances, we feel that the appellants should have been allowed relief by the High Court itself instead of driving them to the need of initiating arbitration proceedings.</span> \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1885496\" id=\"span_29\">24.In fact, as found by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1885496/\" id=\"a_37\">the said judgment</a>, the earlier judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1885496/\" id=\"a_38\">Whirlpool Corporation Vs.

There are two well-recognised exceptions to the  doctrine of exhaustion of statutory remedies. First is when the proceedings are taken before the forum under a provision of law which is ultra vires, it is open to a party aggrieved thereby to move the High Court for quashing the proceedings on the ground that they are incompetent without a party being obliged to wait until those proceedings run their full course. Secondly, the doctrine has no application when the impugned order has been made in violation of the principles of natural justice. We may add that where the proceedings itself are an abuse of process of law the High Court in an appropriate case can entertain a writ petition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">\t23(24)Where under  a statue there is an allegation of infringement of fundamental rights or when on the undisputed facts the taxing authorities are shown to have assumed jurisdiction which they do not possess can be the grounds on which the writ petitions can be entertained. But, normally, the High Court should not entertain writ petitions unless it is shown that there is something more in a case, something going to the root of the jurisdiction of the officer, something which would show that it would be a case of palpable injustice to the writ petitioner to force him to adopt the remedies provided by the statute\u0014.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">\t9.In the light of the aforesaid settled legal position we are not inclined to accept the contention that the writ petition is not maintainable. After going through the facts and circumstances of the case, we are fully satisfied that the transaction between the 1st respondent and A.T.Mohanraj was only a money lending transaction. In any event, the first respondent had fully settled the claim of the A.T.Mohanraj. Thus, the so-called partnership had never come into existence. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are not inclined to interfere with the order of the learned single Judge. Consequently, the writ appeal is dismissed, and the appellant-Corporation is directed to comply with the order of the learned single Judge forthwith. Consequently, connected C.M.P.is also dismissed.

That was a case where an allegation of adulteration in petroleum product has been made on the basis of a particular test which did not form part of either the dealership agreement, or the Statutory Order and it was in those circumstances, it was held that there can be no presumption that dealer therein should be termed as an adulterator and on the fact that the samples taken were sent to the laborartory in violation of the various Clauses of the Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel (Regulation of Supply, Distribution and Prevention of Malpractices) Order, 2005 which is a statutory enactment passed by virtue of the powers conferred under <a href=\"/doc/11894189/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 3</a> of the Essential Commodities Act 1955,, it was held that the test conducted was extraneous and unfounded in the dealership agreement and that cannot be a ground for branding a dealer as an adulterator.

Orissa State Electricity Board</a> reported in 1975 (2) SCC 436, a three-Judge Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court while construing the provision of the <a href=\"/doc/701121/\" id=\"a_53\">Electricity Supply Act, 1948</a> which provides a reference to arbitration as per the contractual stipulations and in those circumstances, when the jurisdiction of the High Court was invoked under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India while confirming the order of the High Court in declining to entertain on the basis of the availability of remedy under the arbitration held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">\t\u00139. But that does not put an end to the controversy between the parties. It is true that in the press note the Board relied only on <a href=\"/doc/1283214/\" id=\"a_55\">Sections 49</a> and 59 and the <a href=\"/doc/701121/\" id=\"a_56\">Sixth Schedule of the Supply Act</a> as the source of the power under which it claimed to levy the coal surcharge and these provisions have been found not to contain the power sought in them. But, if there is one principle more well settled than any other, it is that, when an authority takes action which is within its competence, it cannot be held to be invalid, merely because it purports to be made under a wrong provision, if it can be shown to be within its power under any other provision. A mere wrong description of the source of power \u0017 a mere wrong label \u0017 cannot invalidate the action of an authority, if it is otherwise within its power. The Board claimed that, in any event, even if <a href=\"/doc/1467548/\" id=\"a_57\">Sections 49</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1787076/\" id=\"a_58\">59</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/701121/\" id=\"a_59\">Sixth Schedule to the Supply Act</a> could not be construed as authorising the Board to enhance unilaterally the rates for supply of electricity, the Board had the power under clause (13) of the agreement to levy the coal surcharge on the appellant and the decision to levy the coal surcharge could be justified by reference to this power. Now, if this claim of the Board were well founded, it would afford a complete answer to the challenge made on behalf of the appellant. But the appellant raised various contentions in answer to this plea based on clause (13) of the agreement. We may have referred to some of these contentions in an earlier part of the judgment. It is here that the case of the appellant founders on the rock of the preliminary objection. Clause (23) of the agreement provides that any dispute or difference relating to a question, thing or matter arising under the agreement shall be referred to the arbitration of a single arbitrator. Questions such as: whether the Board had power under clause (13) of the agreement to levy any coal surcharge at all when no such power was conferred on it by the Act, whether the action of the Board in levying the coal surcharge on the appellant under clause (13) of the agreement was arbitrary and unreasonable or whether it was based on extraneous and irrelevant considerations and whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Board was justified under clause (13) of the agreement to levy the coal surcharge on the appellant, are plainly questions arising under the agreement and they are covered by the arbitration provision contained in clause (23) of the agreement. All the contentions raised by the appellant against the claim to justify the levy of the coal surcharge by reference to clause (13) of the agreement would, therefore, seem to be covered by the arbitration agreement and there is no reason why the appellant should not pursue the remedy of arbitration which it has solemnly accepted under clause (23) of the agreement and instead invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to determine questions which really form the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement. We are, therefore, of the view that the High Court was right in exercising its discretion against entertaining the writ petition on merits, insofar as it was directed against the validity of the levy of the coal surcharge under clause (13) of the agreement. The merits of the contentions raised by the appellant would have to be decided by arbitration as provided in clause (23) of the agreement\u0014.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"888433\" id=\"span_37\">30.Again while construing the same <a href=\"/doc/701121/\" id=\"a_61\">Electricity Supply Act, 1948</a>, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has reiterated the said stand in M/s.Bisra <a href=\"/doc/888433/\" id=\"a_62\">Stone Lime Company Ltd., and another Vs.

It is then submitted that this Court should not use its discretion in favour of arbitration in a matter where it is a pure question of law as to the power of the Board to levy a surcharge. This submission would have great force if the sole question involved were the scope and ambit of the power of the Board under <a href=\"/doc/1467548/\" id=\"a_63\">Sections 49</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1787076/\" id=\"a_64\">59</a> of the Act to levy a surcharge, as it was sought to be initially argued. The question in that event may not have been within the content of clause 23 of the agreement. But all questions of law, one of which may be interpretation of the agreement, need not necessarily be withdrawn from the domestic forum because the court has discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and that the court is better posted to decide such questions. The arbitration clause 23 is a clause of wide amplitude taking in its sweep even interpretation of the agreement and necessarily, therefore, of Clause 13 therein. We are, therefore, unable to accede to the submission that we should exercise our discretion to withhold the matter from arbitration and deal with it ourselves\u0014.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">thereby holding that the arbitration clause is having amplitude.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979603\" id=\"span_38\">31.Even in cases where the governmental contracts provide for reference of any doubt and dispute to the State for final decision it was held by the Supreme Court that <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_67\">Arbitration Act</a> 1940 would apply and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is barred.

A fine distinction was made by S.B.Sinha,J as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1901448\" id=\"span_42\">\u001315.One of the points that falls for determination is the scope for judicial interference in matters of administrative decisions. Administrative action is stated to be referable to broad area of governmental activities in which the repositories of power may exercise every class of statutory function of executive, quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial nature. It is trite law that exercise of power, whether legislative or administrative, will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary (see <a href=\"/doc/1901448/\" id=\"a_82\">State of U.P. v. Renusagar Power Co.5</a>). At one time, the traditional view in England was that the executive was not answerable where its action was attributable to the exercise of prerogative power. Professor de Smith in his classical work Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 4th Edn. at pp.\t285-87 states the legal position in his own terse language that the relevant principles formulated by the courts may be broadly summarised as follows: The authority in which discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In general, discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed. That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it; it must not act under the dictates of another body or disable itself from exercising discretion in each individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion, it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorised to do. It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. These several principles can conveniently be grouped in two main categories: (i) failure to exercise a discretion, and (ii) excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive. Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account, and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires\u0014</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"855552\" id=\"span_43\">35.Again in <a href=\"/doc/855552/\" id=\"a_83\">Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and others Vs.

Therefore, we find it difficult to apply the ratio in that decision to commercial contracts. If in commercial contract matters in between the private party and the State or instructions coming within the definition of the State as per <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_92\">Art.12</a> of the Constitution, the said ratio is applied then it would not be necessary to have any Civil Court also. Breacher otherwise of a commercial contract depends upon performance or otherwise of several conditions of the contract and the facts involved therein and determination of the liability involving money claim, require evidence oral and/or documentary as the case may be. The parties will be entitled to damages also. Therefore, in the nature of things, such claims are to be adjudicated after trial by the competent civil Court or arbitration if the contract  contains an arbitration clause.

The Apex Court has further stated that duty to act fairly is part of fair procedure envisaged under Arts.14 and 21 of the Constitution and every activity of the public authority or those under Public duty or obligation must be informed by reason and guided by the public interest. In this case, the Apex Court was considering the legality and validity of the  conditions imposed in the policy. Though technically speaking, this was a question regarding the interpretation of the clauses of an agreement, it cannot be forgotten that there is a definite distinction between the reported decision and the case on hand. In paragraph 28, the Apex Court says:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">\t\u0013The distinction between the public law remedy and private law field cannot be demarcated with precision.  Each case has to be examined on its own facts and circumstances to find out the nature of the activity or scope and nature of the controversy.

The actions of the appellants bears public character with an imprint of public interest element in their offers, with terms and conditions mentioned in the appropriate table inviting the public to enter into contract of life insurance. It is not a pure and simple private law dispute without any insignia of public element.\u0014(Italic Supplied)\nThe emphasised upon portion would show that the situation is not the same here.

These observations were made in the backdrop of the facts that in the reported decision, a showcause notice issued by the Registrar of Trade Marks under <a href=\"/doc/1930013/\" id=\"a_112\">Sec.56(4)</a> of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958 was challenged by a writ petition.  There can be no dispute regarding the principles but it has already been pointed out that there is no question of enforcement of any fundamental rights in this petition, particularly because the Corporation has relied upon the specific clauses of the agreement to terminate the contract and, therefore, the action cannot be termed as wholly arbitrary. It has also been shown that there would be no question of violation of principles of natural justice, as not only the showcause notice has been served, but there are documents in the records to suggest that the reply to that show cause notice has been thoroughly considered and the corporation is acting on the basis of the agreement which has been entered into by the petitioner with open eyes. For these reasons, the judgment is of no assistance.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">\t19.Reliance was also made by the learned counsel for the petitioner on the reported decision in Vasant D.Bhavsar V.Bar Council of India, (1999)1 SCC 45 where the Supreme Court has castigated the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Council of India suggesting that their orders in disciplinary matters should be speaking orders and they must set out the reasons for which they are passed.  According to the learned counsel, in the present impugned order, no reasons are given. As a matter of fact, in this case, the Apex Court was dealing with the quasi-judicial bodies like the Disciplinary Committees and the question was whether the appellant had \u0013misconducted\u0014 himself within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1460739/\" id=\"a_113\">Sec.35</a> of the Advocates Act. The observations would certainly have to be read in the light of the facts which are totally distinct and different from the facts involved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">\t20.Lastly, reliance was placed on the Full Bench Judgment of this Court reported in Aluminium Industries Ltd., Madras represented by its Commercial Manager Laboi, Madras-18 V. Minerals &amp; Metals Trading Corporation of India Ltd., Chennai :1997(2) CTC 636, where the Full Bench has held that in the contractual matters also, there is a power of judicial review to decide the validity of such contract on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_114\">Art.14</a> of the Constitution. Heavy reliance is placed on the observations in paragraphs 47 and 48, where the Court has spoken the plenary jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_115\">Art.226</a> of the Constitution. In paragraph 47, the Full Bench observes:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">\t\u0013While reiterating that ordinarily writ petitons cannot be entertained under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_116\">Art.226</a> of the Constitution of India for enforcement of terms of contract, or to claim damages arising out of concluded contract for breach of contract, one of the parties being the State or Authority to such contract, we hold that the jurisdiction to exercise the power of judicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_117\">Art.226</a> of the Constitution is not totally curtailed or absolutely excluded in examining and testing the validity of State action, even in such matters in extraordinary cases as to whether the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_118\">Art.14</a> of the Constitution were satisfied by the State/Authority, though ordinarily the courts may not entertain writ petitions, and decline to grant relief exercising powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_119\">Art.226</a> of the Constitution for enforcement of terms of contract or to get remedy for a breach of contract on the basis of concluded contract, one of the parties being State or authority to such contracts.\u0014\nThere can be no doubt about the correctness to these observations. However, it cannot be forgotten that there is no question of breach of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Art.14</a> of the Constitution in the present scenario which has already been discussed. The decision of the Full Bench has turned entirely on the back drop of the breach of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_121\">Art.14</a> of the Constitution on the part of the State where the State is one of the contracting parties. I have already found that there is no such breach in the present case. The ratio, therefore, will not apply to the present case. This is besides the fact that in that case, admittedly, there were no disputed questions of facts arising for consideration. Such is clearly not the case here as there are number of disputed questions of facts in the present writ petition.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">\t21.In view of all the above discussions, it has to be held that the present writ petition is not maintainable and would have to be dismissed and accordingly, it is dismissed. No costs. W.M.P.Nos.13049 of 1998 and 17320 of 1999 are dismissed\u0014.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">\t39.In respect of the same Hindusan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., the First Bench of this Court presided over by the Hon&#x27;ble Mr.K.G.Balakrishnan, the Chief Justice (as His Lordship then was) in the judgment, dated 01.02.2000 in W.A.No.2609 of 1999 in S.Sitaraman Vs. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., and another after analysing the above said judgments held as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">\t\u001315.From the aforesaid decisions, it is clear that in the matter of non-statutory contracts, the provisions of contract not to be agitated in a writ petition and under such circumstances, the remedy of judicial review would be available only if it is proved that the action taken was arbitrary and actuated by mala fides. It has been held by the learned single Judge that the action taken by the respondent Company was not either arbitrary or mala fide. The respondent has alleged certain violations of the terms of the agreement. Whether the appellant, in fact, violated these terms, is a question of facts to be decided on the basis of the evidence to be adduced  before the appropriate authority. Admittedly, there is an arbitration clause in the agreement and the appellant, at one point of time, in his explanation stated that if there is any dispute between the parties, the matter should be referred to the arbitration and the respondent cannot unilaterally decide the matter. Merely because detailed reasons are not given in the notice terminating the contract, it may not give rise to a cause of action to the appellant to seek cancellation of the same. The appellant was aware of all the facts and there were series of correspondence between the appellant and the respondent regarding the nature of the alleged violation of the various terms of the contract. When there are disputed questions of fact and the contract itself provides for a mode of settlement of disputes, the appellant is not entitled to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution for judicial review and the remedy of the appellant lies elsewhere\u0014.\n</blockquote>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">\t40.The line of judgments in this regard are enormous, continuing and consistently.  Applying the said categorical judicial pronouncements of the Apex Court through out, there is absolutely no difficulty to conclude on the factual matrix of this case that the petitioner is not entitled for any relief claimed in this writ petition. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\t41.For all the above said reasons, the writ petition fails and the same is dismissed. However, this order does not prevent the petitioner to enforce its right in the arbitration clause of the agreement in the manner known to law. No costs. Consequently, M.P.(MD)Nos.1 and 2 of 2008 are closed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19.03.2010\nIndex   : Yes/No\nInternet : Yes/No\nsms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">1.Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.,\n  Rep by Senior Regional Manager,\n  No.8, Gandhi Irwin Road,\n  Egmore,\n  Chennai 8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">2.The Field Officer,\n  Rep by Senior Regional Manager,\n  No.8, Gandhi Irwin Road,\n  Egmore,\n  Chennai 8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">3.The Area Sales Manager,\n  Rep by Senior Regional Manager,\n  No.8, Gandhi Irwin Road,\n  Egmore,\n  Chennai 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.JYOTHIMANI,J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">sms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-delivery order in\nWrit Petition No.24661 of 2009\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19.03.2010</p>","numcites":44,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Madras High Court","citetid":1048611,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"violation of principles of natural justice","formInput":"violation%20of%20principles%20of%20natural%20justice"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution of india","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution%20of%20india"},{"value":"constitution of india articles","formInput":"constitution%20of%20india%20articles"},{"value":" breach of contracts","formInput":"%20breach%20of%20contracts"},{"value":"writ petition not maintainable","formInput":"writ%20petition%20not%20maintainable"},{"value":"statutory contract what is","formInput":"statutory%20contract%20what%20is"},{"value":"principles of natural justice","formInput":"principles%20of%20natural%20justice"},{"value":"judicial review","formInput":"judicial%20review"},{"value":"hindustan petroleum ","formInput":"hindustan%20petroleum%20"},{"value":"concluded contract","formInput":"concluded%20contract"},{"value":"ar.l.sundaresan","formInput":"ar.l.sundaresan"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"dealership agreement","formInput":"dealership%20agreement"},{"value":"all india reporter","formInput":"all%20india%20reporter"},{"value":"constitution article 14","formInput":"constitution%20article%2014"},{"value":"226 of the constitution of india","formInput":"226%20of%20the%20constitution%20of%20india"},{"value":"non statutory contracts","formInput":"non%20statutory%20contracts"},{"value":"2008 (8) scc 172","formInput":"2008%20%288%29%20scc%20172"},{"value":"contractual obligations","formInput":"contractual%20obligations"},{"value":"indian oil corporation ","formInput":"indian%20oil%20corporation%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
