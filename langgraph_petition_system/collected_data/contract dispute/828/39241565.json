The\n                                learned Single Judge has proceeded to allow the writ\n                                petition and quashed the termination of the contract on\n                                the ground that no reasons have been assigned thereto.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                3.

At the very outset, as pointed out by Shri T.R.Rajagopalan,\n\n                      learned Senior Counsel for the appellant Corporation, even though the\n\n                      duration of the contract has been shown to be 24 months in the\n\n                      agreement dated 24.7.2019 said to have been executed between the\n\n                      parties, yet the period of the contract, as disclosed in the tender notice\n\n                      dated 19.6.2019, was one year only.               While issuing the letter of\n\n                      acceptance dated 10.7.2019, there was a stipulation that the contract\n\n\n\n                      _______\n                      Page 5\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                              W.A.No.158 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n                      shall be for a period of one year and liable to be extended for another\n\n                      period of one year at the discretion of the appellant Corporation.\n\n                      Thus, according to Shri Rajagopalan, learned Senior Counsel, the\n\n                      contract has to be construed for a period of one year only and which\n\n                      period expired on 31.7.2020.      He, therefore, submits that no further\n\n                      relief can be extended to the first respondent petitioner, as the\n\n                      contract has not been extended at the discretion of the appellant\n\n                      Corporation for a further duration of one year, and therefore, the\n\n                      continuance extended under the impugned judgment deserves to be\n\n                      set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">                               4.

             14. The learned Single Judge has held that the letter of\n\n                      acceptance cannot override the terms of the agreement.         However,\n\n                      another aspect of the matter viz., terms of the tender notice dated\n\n                      19.6.2019, has not been dealt with by the learned Single Judge, which\n\n                      categorically prescribes the period of contract at item No.7 in the\n\n                      tender notice as one year only. The letter of acceptance does say that\n\n                      the same would be for a period of one year and would be extendable\n\n                      by a period of one year at the sole discretion of the Indian Oil\n\n                      Corporation Limited. This aspect also does not appear to have been\n\n                      dealt with by the learned Single Judge while arriving at that\n\n                      conclusion. We, therefore, find that if there is a dispute with regard to\n\n                      the duration of the contract, then the same would be clearly an\n\n                      arbitrable dispute.   Nonetheless, in the present case, this is not the\n\n                      reason for which the contract came to be pre-closed.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">                            15.

Whether there were any conditions available for termination\n\n                      or not, as per the terms of Clause 29 of the agreement, may be an\n\n                      arbitral dispute under Clause 32 thereof. But, in the absence of any\n\n                      reasons, we find that the appellant Corporation could have dealt with\n\n                      the matter by passing an appropriate reasoned order even if it was\n\n                      proceeding to take a decision of pre-closure of the contract, more so,\n\n                      when it was to adversely affect the duration of the contract that was\n\n                      already subsisting.   To that extent, we find the order of pre-closure\n\n                      to be deficient in law.   This could have been very easily rectified by\n\n                      giving some appropriate reasons, which obviously has not been done\n\n                      for reasons best known to the appellant Corporation.    The subsequent\n\n                      communication dated 26.11.2019 simply states as per terms and\n\n                      conditions of tender and the discretion of the Corporation.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">                            17.

The learned Single Judge concludes that the agreement\n\n                      being for 24 months, its pre-closure without valid reason is against the\n\n                      contract. In our opinion, the offer, the acceptance and the agreement\n\n                      followed by the work order dated 25.7.2019 read together does reflect\n\n                      the power of the appellant to terminate the agreement or extend the\n\n                      contract for one year after the expiry of one year at its sole discretion.\n\n                      This aspect is being disputed by the first respondent petitioner.      The\n\n                      discretion of the appellant under the letter of acceptance cannot be a\n\n                      substituted exercise by the Court, and if disputed, the arbitration\n\n                      clause is clearly attracted as the dispute arises out of and in relation to\n\n                      the duration of the contract. This area of dispute is therefore in our\n\n                      opinion for the reasons aforesaid clearly an arbitral dispute involving\n\n                      the determination of the intention of the contracting parties that would\n\n                      involve questions of fact, which should not be a matter of investigation\n\n                      under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_41\">21.

It\n\n                      has been held that if it is found that the nature of the activity or the\n\n                      controversy involves public law element then only the matter can be\n\n                      examined under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">Art.226</a> of the Constitution of India to adjudicate\n\n                      whether the action of the instrumentality or the State agency is fair,\n\n                      just and equitable while undergoing the decision-making process and is\n\n                      otherwise not arbitrary. On the facts of the present case, the decision-\n\n                      making process of ordering pre-closure of the contract was not\n\n                      supported by any reasons recited in the order itself.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1831036\" id=\"span_43\">The reason\n\n                      otherwise stated in the counter-affidavit or in the subsequent\n\n                      communication dated 26-11-2019 did not indicate any reason arising\n\n                      out of the contract or otherwise was sought to be supported through\n\n                      an affidavit which cannot be accepted in view of the law <a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_34\">laid down in</a>\n\n                      the case of <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_35\">Mohinder Singh Gill</a> (supra).

The learned single Judge ought to have limited the exercise of\n\n                      jurisdiction, if at all only to that extent but beyond that it was a private\n\n                      contractual arbitral dispute that would be governed by the terms of\n\n                      arbitration. The reasons that were sought to be supplemented through\n\n                      the    counter     affidavit   or   the   communication     dated    26.11.2019,\n\n                      therefore, would be a matter of assessment if the arbitration clause is\n\n                      invoked. We therefore view this transaction by splitting into two, the\n\n                      validity of the decision-making process and then the course of action\n\n                      available to the parties. Consequently, whether the duration of the\n\n                      contract or its continuance in the terms thereof would be purely a\n\n                      contractual dispute for which a arbitral dispute has to be raised and a\n\n                      Writ    Petition    under      <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_36\">Art.226</a>    for   that   purpose    would   not   be\n\n                      maintainable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n                      _______\n                      Page 28\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                                                              W.A.No.158 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"36553068\" id=\"span_46\">22. There is yet another aspect which we may point out that\n\n                      when it comes to gathering intention of the contracting parties, one of\n\n                      the questions is as to whether there is any intention in the contract to\n\n                      block the consideration of any part of the transaction which took place\n\n                      prior to the agreement viz. intentions which can be gathered from the\n\n                      notice of the tender, its acceptance and the work order. In the event a\n\n                      conflict in this respect is to be resolved then there is a presumption\n\n                      that the parties intended to abide by such terms and conditions\n\n                      including the terms of duration of the contract. The interpretation on\n\n                      this issue is also to be looked into from the point of view as to who is\n\n                      the author of the document. On this we may quote paragraph 39 of\n\n                      the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/36553068/\" id=\"a_37\">Cartel Infotech Limited v.\n\n                      Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and others</a>, reported\n\n                      in (2019) 14 SCC 81 that is gainfully reproduced herein under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                                “39.

We do not think this to be a\n\n                      broad spectrum view inasmuch as the privilege offered to such security\n\n                      agencies by virtue of a scheme from the Director General of\n\n                      Rehabilitation is not a guarantee for offering a contract of services but\n\n                      a privilege for extending priority in order to avail professional\n\n                      engagements as a measure of first choice by the Public Sector\n\n                      Undertakings (PSUs) to ultimately extend a measure of rehabilitation.\n\n\n                      _______\n                      Page 31\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                                                              W.A.No.158 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n                      The PSUs therefore cannot avoid adopting of such priority measures,\n\n                      but in the present case this is not the issue at all. The only issue is as\n\n                      to whether the pre-closure ordered by the appellant was justified or\n\n                      not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_62\">                             25. What has happened in the present case is that the notice\n\n                      dated 19.6.2019 inviting tender and the letter of acceptance dated\n\n                      10.7.2019 categorically recite that the tenure of the contract shall be\n\n                      one year and its further duration for another year to be extended at\n\n                      the discretion of the appellant. This has not been considered and its\n\n                      impact examined by the learned Single Judge, but nonetheless it was\n\n                      open to the appellant Corporation to have exercised its discretion\n\n                      appropriately.     The pending litigation does not appear to have\n\n                      impeded this exercise of discretion. The appellant Corporation has\n\n                      already, according to the learned counsel for the appellant, awarded\n\n                      the contract to a different person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">                             26. In the facts of the present case, we find that the learned\n\n                      Single Judge has maintained the duration of 24 months on the ground\n\n                      that there is an agreement to that effect. As already noted above, this\n\n                      _______\n                      Page 32\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                                                            W.A.No.158 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n                      finding has been arrived at without looking to the tender notice as well\n\n                      as the letter of acceptance dated 10.7.2019.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                            27. There is yet another fact which cannot be lost sight of and\n\n                      which was hinted at by the learned counsel for the appellant. Mr.\n\n                      Rajagopalan contends that the correctness or otherwise of the recitals\n\n                      in the agreement and the manner of its execution may require a\n\n                      departmental enquiry keeping in view the terms of the notice of the\n\n                      tender, the letter of acceptance and the work order but he submits\n\n                      that he would not make any submissions on that count as that is in the\n\n                      discretion of the Corporation. We also do not intend to take the matter\n\n                      any further on that issue but since the learned counsel for the first\n\n                      respondent/petitioner has invited our attention to the agreement which\n\n                      is a photocopy, we do not find the designation of the official who has\n\n                      signed on behalf of Indian Oil Corporation and secondly, the letter of\n\n                      acceptance having been issued by the Deputy General Manager\n\n                      (Contracts), his endorsement or signature on the said contract does\n\n                      not appear to be recited. Another issue relating to the document is\n\n                      that the learned counsel for the first respondent/petitioner relied on\n\n\n\n                      _______\n                      Page 33\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                                                            W.A.No.158 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n                      the Empanelment Certificate the validity whereof is certified from 13 th\n\n                      March, 2019 to 6th January, 2020. It is further provided that the\n\n                      validity of the certificate would be also governed by the maximum age\n\n                      of 60 years of the age of the proprietor of the agency.        The first\n\n                      respondent/petitioner may have been below the age of 60 years at the\n\n                      time when the contract was entered into but as on date keeping in\n\n                      view the date of birth of the first respondent/petitioner as indicated\n\n                      therein which is 7-1-1960, the first respondent/petitioner has crossed\n\n                      the age of 60 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">                            28. We, therefore, modify the impugned judgment and allow the\n\n                      appeal to the said extent, whereby the learned Single Judge has\n\n                      treated the contract to be for two years without adverting to the\n\n                      aforesaid documents. In the light of what has been said above, even\n\n                      though we uphold the quashing of the pre-closure notice by the\n\n                      learned Single Judge, we find that the extension of the contract to\n\n                      survive for the entire period of 24 months is seriously disputed. In the\n\n                      event, the first respondent petitioner seeks any continuance or\n\n                      extension of the contract, the same is at the sole discretion of the\n\n\n\n                      _______\n                      Page 34\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                                                            W.A.No.158 of 2020</span>\n\n\n\n                      Corporation or in the event any dispute is preferred by the first\n\n                      respondent petitioner, then the   arbitration platform will have to be\n\n                      availed of.   The impugned judgment dated 30.12.2019, whereby the\n\n                      learned Single Judge has issued directions for adherence to the\n\n                      agreement for continuing the contract is therefore set aside, subject to\n\n                      the above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">                            The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.
