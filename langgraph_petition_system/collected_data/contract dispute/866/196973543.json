This petition under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India\n\n     has been preferred by the petitioners/State for setting aside\n\n     the execution proceedings initiated by the respondent/\n\n     Contractor before the District Judge, Bilaspur, in MJC\n\n     No.310/2015 and Execution Case No.962/2015, as being\n\n     wholly untenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">2.   The respondent&#x27;s tender for the subject work of Amamuda\n\n     Diversion Plan in River Arpa Hasdeo Kachhar was accepted\n\n     and the work order was issued for completion of the work up\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                2</span>\n\n     to 21.01.2013, which was later on extended by four months,\n\n     to be completed up to 31.05.2013, but the respondent failed\n\n     to complete the work and left it midway, therefore, as per\n\n     clause 4.3.3.3 the contract was cancelled (under the risk\n\n     and cost clause).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3.   Against the termination of tender and forfeiture of earnest\n\n     money, the respondent invoked clause 4.3.29 of the\n\n     agreement petitioning the Superintending Engineer for\n\n     appropriate orders.

On remission, the Superintending Engineer passed an order\n\n     on 14.05.2015 allowing claim of Rs.79,73,240/- in favour of\n\n     the respondent. Treating this order as an award the\n\n     respondent moved execution application before the District\n\n     Judge under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 36</a> of the Act, 1996 read with Section\n\n     18 of the Chhattisgarh Madhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam,\n\n     1983 (for short &#x27;the Adhiniyam, 1983&#x27;) on 09.07.2015\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  3</span>\n\n       together with an application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_3\">Order 21 Rule 13 of the\n\n       Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908 (for short &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">the CPC</a>&#x27;) for\n\n       attachment of the Department&#x27;s Bank account. The\n\n       petitioner, on its turn, has moved an application under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a> of the Act, 1996 for grant of temporary injunction\n\n       on the plea that the respondent had withdrawn WPC\n\n       No.2550/2014 before the Division Bench of this Court on\n\n       05.01.2015 seeking liberty to raise dispute before the\n\n       Arbitration Tribunal, however, it again preferred WPC\n\n       No.90/2015 wherein the matter was remitted back to the\n\n       Superintending Engineer for passing fresh orders, meaning\n\n       thereby that the respondent moved two successive writ\n\n       petitions without informing the subsequent Division Bench\n\n       that it has already withdrawn the earlier writ petition. The\n\n       petitioners also stated that the order passed by the\n\n       Superintending Engineer is not the award being simply the\n\n       decision by the Departmental Authority on the claim raised\n\n       by the respondent and not an award under the Act, 1996 or\n\n       the Adhiniyam, 1983.

Per     contra,     learned      counsel   appearing     for   the\n\n        respondent/contractor would argue that the State has\n\n        submitted to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, therefore, it\n\n        cannot question the award passed by the Superintending\n\n        Engineer. It is also argued that in the claim preferred before\n\n        the Tribunal, State has referred the Superintending\n\n        Engineer as Arbitrator and moreover in the pleadings made\n\n        before the Superintending Engineer, he has been referred\n\n        as    Arbitrator,   therefore,    the   order   passed    by   the\n\n        Superintending Engineer is an award to resolve the dispute\n\n        between the parties against which Section 9 application is\n\n        not maintainable before the District Judge.

If the construction suggested by the\n                      respondent is given effect then the decision of\n                      the Public Health Engineer would become\n                      final and it is not even necessary to have it\n                      made rule of the court under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_30\">Arbitration\n                      Act</a>.

The other factors which are relevant\ninclude, whether the agreement contemplates\nthat the tribunal will receive evidence from\nboth sides and hear their contentions or at\nleast give the parties an opportunity to put\nthem forward; whether the wording of the\nagreement is consistent or inconsistent with\nthe view that the process was intended to be\nan arbitration, and whether the agreement\nrequires the tribunal to decide the dispute\naccording to law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">19. In Russell on Arbitration, 21st Edn., at\np. 37, para 2-014, the question how to\ndistinguish between an expert determination\nand arbitration, has been examined. It is\nstated,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                14</span>\n\n     &quot;Many cases have been fought over\n     whether a contract&#x27;s chosen form of\n     dispute        resolution        is      expert\n     determination or arbitration. This is a\n     matter of construction of the contract,\n     which involves an objective enquiry into\n     the intentions of the parties. First, there\n     are the express words of the disputes\n     clause. If specific words such as\n     &#x27;arbitrator&#x27;, &#x27;arbitral tribunal&#x27;, &#x27;arbitration&#x27;\n     or the formula &#x27;as an expert and not as\n     an arbitrator&#x27; are used to describe the\n     manner in which the dispute resolver is\n     to act, they are likely to be persuasive\n     although not always conclusive....\n     Where there is no express wording, the\n     court will refer to certain guidelines. Of\n     these, the most important used to be,\n     whether there was an &#x27;issue&#x27; between\n     the parties such as the value of an asset\n     on which they had not taken defined\n     positions, in which case the procedure\n     was held to be expert determination; or a\n     &#x27;formulated dispute&#x27; between the parties\n     where defined positions had been taken,\n     in which case the procedure was held to\n     be an arbitration. This imprecise concept\n     is still being relied on. It is unsatisfactory\n     because some parties to contract\n     deliberately choose expert determination\n     for dispute resolution. The next guideline\n     is the judicial function of an arbitral\n     tribunal as opposed to the expertise of\n     the expert; .... An arbitral tribunal arrives\n     at its decision on the evidence and\n     submissions of the parties and must\n     apply the law or if the parties agree, on\n     other consideration; an expert, unless it\n     is agreed otherwise, makes his own\n     enquiries, applies his own expertise and\n     decides on his own expert opinion....&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">24. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26826\" id=\"span_29\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/26826/\" id=\"a_32\">Cursetji Jamshedji\nArdaseer Wadia v.

The test of preventing disputes or\n                 deciding disputes was also resorted to for the\n                 purpose      of   considering  whether     the\n                 agreement was a reference to arbitration or\n                 not. In that case, the agreement provided that\n                 the parties had agreed to enter into a\n                 compromise for payment of a sum up to, but\n                 not exceeding, Rs 20 lakhs,\n                       &quot;which shall be borne and paid by the\n                       parties in such proportions or manner as\n                       Sir Jamshedji B.

The Court held that Sir Jamshedji\n                 Kanga had not to decide upon the evidence\n                 led before him. He had to decide in his\n                 absolute discretion. There was not to be a\n                 judicial enquiry worked out in a judicial\n                 manner. Hence this was not an arbitration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">                                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">14.

For all the above-stated reasons, since the order passed by\n\n         the Superintending Engineer does not amount to an award,\n\n         the respondent is not entitled to initiate the execution\n\n         proceeding before the District Judge, therefore, the MJC\n\n         No.310/2015 and the Execution case No.962/2015 arising\n\n         out of purported award passed by the Superintending\n\n         Engineer being without jurisdiction or authority of law\n\n         deserves to be and is hereby set aside.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">   17.
