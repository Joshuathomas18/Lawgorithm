(`IOC&#x27; for short)\n\nfor running its canteen at its Western Region Marketing Division at\n\nMumbai. The appellant union filed W.P.No.1267/1999 in the Bombay\n\nHigh Court on behalf of the said workers seeking the following\n\nreliefs: (i) a direction to the Central Advisory Contract Labour Board\n\nand Union of India to hold an investigation under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_1\">section 10</a> of the\n\nContract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_2\">CLRA Act</a>&#x27;\n\nfor short), on its application dated 29.12.1998 and make an order\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                     2</span>\n\n\nabolishing the contract labour system in regard to workmen in the\n\ncanteen of Marketing division of IOC; and (b) a direction to IOC to\n\nabsorb/regularize the services of the said workers. The writ petition\n\nwas dismissed for want of prosecution on 11.11.2003.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">2.    Thereafter the appellant again approached the High Court in\n\nW.P.No.853/2004 contending that the contracts between IOC and the\n\ncanteen contractor was sham and bogus and seeking a direction to the\n\nUnion of India to make a reference of the dispute raised by them in\n\nregard to the demand for permanency of the canteen workers to the\n\nIndustrial Tribunal. The High Court vide order dated 22.4.2004\n\ndisposed of the said writ petition with a direction to the Central\n\nGovernment to consider and dispose of the request for reference with\n\na further direction to maintain status quo in regard to concerned\n\nworkmen till disposal of the reference application. In pursuance of it\n\nconciliation proceedings were held and the Assistant Labour\n\nCommissioner (Central)-III, Mumbai, sent a Failure of Conciliation\n\nReport dated 2.9.2004, Government of India by order dated\n\n21.12.2004 refused to make a reference of the dispute under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/760439/\" id=\"a_3\">section 10(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (`<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_4\">ID Act</a>&#x27; for short).\n\nThe Labour Ministry of the Government of India was of the view that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                    3</span>\n\n\nthe dispute, prima facie, was not fit for adjudication, as &quot;the workmen\n\nin respect of whom the dispute was raised were not appointed by the\n\nmanagement of IOC but were engaged by the contractor holding a\n\nvalid and legal contract.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"465854\" id=\"span_3\">3.    The said order was challenged by the appellant in W.P.No.\n\n1673/2005 seeking a mandamus to the Government of India to refer\n\nthe dispute raised, to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication. The\n\nappellant contended that the central government had usurped the\n\npower and function of the Industrial Tribunal, by deciding the very\n\nissue that required to be referred to and decided by the Tribunal. The\n\nsaid writ petition was dismissed by the High Court by the impugned\n\norder dated 19.8.2006 on the following two grounds : (i) The\n\nappellant had earlier filed WP No.1267/1999 for abolition of contract\n\nlabour in the canteen in the establishment of IOC. The said earlier\n\npetition (W.P.No.1267/1999) was dismissed on 11.11.2003 for non-\n\nprosecution and attained finality; and once having sought the relief of\n\nabolition of contract labour, the appellant was estopped from seeking\n\nany other relief by contending that the contract was sham and not\n\ngenuine. (ii) The order dated 21.12.2004 of the appropriate\n\ngovernment did not suffer from any infirmity or arbitrariness, when\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                     4</span>\n\n\nexamined with reference to the principles laid down by this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/465854/\" id=\"a_5\">Avon Services Production Agencies (P) Ltd. v. The Industrial\n\nTribunal</a> [1979 (1) SCC 1]. The said order is challenged in this appeal\n\nby special leave.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">4.     The contentions urged by the parties give rise to the following\n\nquestions for determination :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(i)    whether in view of the stand taken by the appellant in WP\n       No.1267 of 1999 , the appellant was estopped from taking a\n       different stand in the subsequent writ petition (WP 1673/2005).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(ii)   whether the decision of the central government refusing\n       reference requires interference.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">Re : Question (i)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">5.     The appellant submits that the contract labour can take the plea\n\nthat the contract between the principal employer and the contractor is\n\nsham and bogus and that they are, in law, the employees of IOC and\n\nnot of the contractor; and that alternatively they can plead without\n\nprejudice to the first plea, that assuming the contract is genuine, the\n\ncontract labour system should be abolished under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 10</a> of the\n\nCLRA Act. On the same principle, the contract labour can, on the plea\n\nthat the contract between principal employer and the contractor is\n\nsham and nominal, first claim the relief that contract labour system\n\nshould be abolished and they should be absorbed; and if such relief is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                       5</span>\n\n\nrefused or found to be inappropriate, then seek a declaration that they\n\nare really the direct employees of the principal employer.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1160961\" id=\"span_6\">6.    On the other hand, the first respondent-IOC contended that the\n\nappellant cannot be permitted to take contradictory and inconsistent\n\nstands. It is submitted that the prayer in the first writ petition was on\n\nthe assumption that there was a valid contract between IOC and the\n\ncanteen contractor and the workers were in fact the employees of the\n\ncontractor, and that the contract labour system for the canteen in the\n\nestablishment of IOC (marketing department) should be abolished\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_7\">CLRA Act</a> and that after such abolition, the workers should\n\nbe absorbed as employees of the IOC. It is contended that having\n\ntaken such a specific stand in the first petition, the appellant cannot in\n\nthe second petition take a plea that the contract entered between the\n\nIOC and the canteen contractor was sham and bogus and that the\n\ncanteen workers were really the employees of the IOC. Strong\n\nreliance was placed on the following observations of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1160961/\" id=\"a_8\">Steel Authority of India Ltd. v. Union of India</a> [2006 (12) SCC 233,\n\nfor short referred to `SAIL-II&#x27;] :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      &quot;The workmen whether before the Labour Court or in writ\n      proceedings, were represented by the same union. A trade union\n      registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1980557/\" id=\"a_9\">Trade Unions Act</a> is entitled to espouse the\n      cause of the workmen. A definite stand was taken by the\n      employees that they had been working under the contractors. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                        6</span>\n\n      would, thus, in our opinion, not lie in their mouth to take a\n      contradictory and inconsistent plea that they were also the\n      workmen of the principle employer. To raise such a mutually\n      destructive plea is impermissible in law. Such mutually destructive\n      plea, in our opinion, should not be allowed to be raised even in an\n      industrial adjudication. Common law principles of estoppel, waiver\n      and acquiescence are applicable in an industrial adjudication.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">7.    On an examination of the pleadings in W.P.No.1267/1999 and\n\nW.P.No.1673/2005, we find that the issues for consideration, the\n\nparties to the cause, the cause of action and the reliefs claimed were\n\nall different in the two cases. In the first petition, relief was sought\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_10\">Contract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act, 1970</a> for\n\nabolition of contract labour system in the operation of canteen in the\n\nmarketing establishment of IOC and for absorbing the canteen\n\nworkers as employees of IOC. In the second petition, relief was\n\nsought under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_11\">Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</a> for making a reference\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_12\">sec. 10(1)(c)</a> to the Industrial Tribunal to decide whether the\n\ncontract between IOC and the canteen contractor was sham, nominal\n\nand a mere camouflage to avoid extension of labour law benefits to\n\nthe workers in question, and whether the canteen workers were the\n\ndirect employees of IOC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">8.    The assumption that the appellant had taken inconsistent stands\n\nin the two writ petitions is not correct. Even in the first writ petition,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                    7</span>\n\n\nthe appellant had contended that though the contractors changed from\n\ntime to time, the workers in the canteen remained the same with\n\ncontinuity of service; that IOC had mala fide and illegally kept the\n\nworkers as contract labour in order to keep them in a permanent state\n\nof insecurity and to deny them the wages and privileges available to\n\npermanent workers; that IOC was actually controlling, and\n\nsupervising the canteen; and that only as a camouflage, the contractor\n\nwas shown as running the canteen        to create a pretence that the\n\nworkmen of IOC were the workers of the contractor, when in fact they\n\nwere the employees of IOC. In short, the appellant had contended that\n\nthe contract was sham and nominal, in the first petition. Even in the\n\nsecond writ petition (WP No. 1673/2005) the contention was that the\n\ncontract was sham and a camouflage to avoid extending benefits of\n\nregular employees to the canteen workers. Therefore, the High Court\n\ncommitted a serious error in assuming that in the first writ petition,\n\nthe appellant had conceded that the contract between the IOC and the\n\ncanteen contractor was valid and genuine and that in the second writ\n\npetition the appellant had taken a contrary stand that the contract was\n\nsham and a camouflage.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                    8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_10\">9.    The stand of the appellant and the workers was always\n\nconsistent. But before the decision of a Constitution Bench of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_13\">Steel Authority of India Ltd. v. National Union Waterfront\n\nWorkers</a> [2001 (7) SCC 1, for short referred to as `SAIL-I), it was\n\nthought that the appropriate relief available was to seek an\n\ninvestigation and abolition of contract labour under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_14\">CLRA Act</a>\n\nand consequently seek absorption. Therefore the prayer was made\n\nwith reference to the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_15\">CLRA Act</a> in the first petition.       In SAIL-I\n\nrendered on 30.8.2001, this Court held that even if there was an order\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_16\">section 10</a> of CLRA Act prohibiting contract labour in any\n\nprocess or operation, there would be no automatic absorption of the\n\ncontract labour by the principal employer. It was also held that it is\n\nalways open to the contract labour to urge that the contract was sham\n\nand nominal by raising an industrial dispute under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_17\">ID Act</a> and\n\nsuch dispute will have to be decided by the industrial adjudicator and\n\nnot by the High Court; and if on enquiry, the industrial adjudicator\n\nfound that the contract was sham and merely a camouflage for\n\ndenying labour law benefits to the workers in question, it could\n\ndeclare so and hold that the contract labour were really the direct\n\nemployees of the principal employer. When it became clear after the\n\nconstitution bench decision in SAIL-I that if the case of the workmen\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                     9</span>\n\n\nis that the contract between the principal employer and the contractor\n\nwas sham and merely a camouflage to deny benefits to the workers,\n\nthen they could raise a dispute and approach the industrial adjudicator,\n\nthe appellant sought a reference of the dispute to the industrial\n\nadjudicator, and when such a reference was refused, rightly\n\napproached the High Court by way of second writ petition. This\n\nmeans that the appellant had prayed for a particular relief in the first\n\nwrit petition, and when such relief was found to be inappropriate and\n\nthe law was clarified in SAIL-I, on the same fact raised a dispute\n\nwhich was the proper remedy, and as the dispute was not referred to\n\nthe Industrial Tribunal, approached the High Court seeking a direction\n\nto the Central Government for making a reference. There is thus\n\nneither inconsistency nor any estoppel.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">10.   The assumption that there is an absolute bar on inconsistent\n\npleas being taken by a party, is also not sound. What is impermissible\n\nis taking of an inconsistent plea by way of amendment thereby\n\ndenying the other side, the benefit of an admission contained in the\n\nearlier pleading. Mutually repugnant and contradictory pleas,\n\ndestructive of each other may also not be permitted to be urged\n\nsimultaneously by a plaintiff/petitioner. But when there is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                      10</span>\n\n\ninconsistency in the facts alleged, a party is not prohibited from taking\n\nalternative pleas available in law. Similarly, on the same facts,\n\ndifferent or alternative reliefs can also be claimed. When the case of\n\nthe workers is that the contract was sham and nominal, they could\n\nseek a relief that they should be declared as the direct employees of\n\nthe principal employer; and if that contention failed and it is found\n\nthat the contract was valid, then they can seek issue a direction to the\n\nCentral Government to consider their representation for abolition of\n\ncontract labour. Similarly where the workers contend that the contract\n\nbetween principal employer and the contractor was sham and merely a\n\ncamouflage to deny them the benefits of labour laws, and if their\n\nprayer for relief under <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_18\">CLRA Act</a> is rejected, they can then seek relief\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_19\">ID Act</a>. The contention of IOC that on account of the\n\ndismissal of the first petition, the second petition for a different relief\n\nwas barred either by principle of res judicata or by principle of\n\nestoppel is liable to be rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">11.   We will next consider whether the decision in SAIL-II relied on\n\nby the respondents, is in any way applicable. That decision related to a\n\ndispute raised by the contract labour employed by VISL (an unit of\n\nSAIL) for prohibition of employment of contract labour in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                     11</span>\n\n\nprocess/operation in which they were employed and they should be\n\nabsorbed as regular permanent employees of VISL. The state\n\ngovernment referred the said dispute to the Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1218044/\" id=\"a_20\">section\n\n10(1)(c)</a> of the ID Act. Before the Labour Court, VISL contended that\n\nas the matter related to regulation and abolition of contract labour,\n\ngoverned by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_21\">CLRA Act</a>, there could be no\n\nreference of the dispute to the Labour Court for adjudication under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218044/\" id=\"a_22\">section 10(1)(c)</a> of the ID Act. It was also submitted that as the state\n\ngovernment had not issued any notification prohibiting employment\n\nof contract labour in terms of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_23\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act, the\n\ncontract labour did not have a legal right to claim absorption.\n\n\n11.1) At that stage, presumably to get over the said objection\n\nregarding maintainability, the workmen filed an additional claim\n\nstatement alleging that the contract entered into between VISL and the\n\ncontractor was sham and bogus and they should be deemed to be the\n\ndirect employees of the management. The Labour Court held that the\n\ndispute referred was whether the contract workers who were\n\nemployed in the particular nature of contract work were justified in\n\ndemanding absorption as regular employees; that the said dispute pre-\n\nsupposed that the employees were contract workers under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                     12</span>\n\n\ncontractors and the question therefore was whether the contract labour\n\nsystem should be abolished and contract workers had to be absorbed\n\nby the principal employer; that the employees who sought absorption\n\nby VISL were contract labour was evident from the averments made\n\nin the claim statement; and that the only remedy available to them was\n\nto file writ petition seeking a direction to the central government to\n\ntake a decision under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_24\">section 10</a> of CLRA Act to prohibit employment\n\nof contract labour. The Labour Court held that the question under\n\nreference related to    abolition of contract labour and as the said\n\nquestion could be decided only by appropriate Government under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_25\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act, the dispute was not maintainable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_26\">ID Act</a>. Therefore the Labour Court made an award holding that the\n\nreference was not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n11.2) The said award of the Labour Court was challenged in the High\n\nCourt. A learned single Judge allowed the writ petition and directed\n\nthe Union of India to treat the writ petition as a petition submitted by\n\nthe Union raising an industrial dispute in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1817848/\" id=\"a_27\">section 2(k)</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1949741/\" id=\"a_28\">section 12(1)</a> of the ID Act as also under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_29\">CLRA\n\nAct</a>. The learned Judge further directed the central government to\n\nrefer the said dispute to the Industrial Tribunal. The appeal filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                    13</span>\n\n\nagainst <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_30\">the said judgment</a> of the learned Single Judge was dismissed\n\nby a division bench. Aggrieved thereby SAIL approached this Court.\n\nIt is in that background this Court held that the workmen having taken\n\na definite stand that they were working under the contractors, and as\n\nthe dispute that was referred was one which arose under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_31\">CLRA\n\nAct</a>, the workmen could not, by amending the claim statement filed\n\nbefore the Labour Court, take a contradictory and inconsistent plea\n\nthat the contract between VISL and the contractor was sham and\n\nbogus and they were the direct employees of VISL. This Court\n\nobserved that it was impermissible to raise such mutually destructive\n\npleas in law, having regard to the principles of estoppel, waiver and\n\nacquiescence which were also applicable in industrial adjudication.\n\n\n\n11.3) We have referred to the factual situation in detail to\n\ndemonstrate that the said observations made in the context of the\n\npeculiar facts of that case, where the reference by the state\n\ngovernment under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_32\">ID Act</a> was in regard to a specific dispute that\n\nthey were employees of the contractor and that after prohibiting the\n\ncontract labour system under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_33\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act, they should\n\nbe absorbed as direct employees of VISL. This court therefore held\n\nthat in such a reference under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_34\">ID Act</a>, raising a contention that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                      14</span>\n\n\ncontract between VISL and the contractor was bogus and sham and\n\nthat they were direct employees of principal employer contradicted\n\nthe case on the basis of which the reference was sought and reference\n\nwas made, and the two contentions being mutually destructive, such a\n\nplea which would destroy the very reference could not be permitted to\n\nbe raised. The decision in SAIL-II is therefore of no assistance to the\n\nrespondents. What was held to be impermissible in SAIL-II was\n\nraising inconsistent and mutually destructive pleas in the same\n\nproceedings. It does not bar a particular relief being sought in a writ\n\npetition, and when it is found that such a relief was inappropriate, then\n\nseeking appropriate relief in a different proceedings.\n\n\n\n11.4) The facts are completely different here. The issue in the first\n\nwrit petition was with reference to <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_35\">section 10</a> of CLRA Act.

This section is of\n      basic importance in the scheme of the Act.

In Hochtif Gammon, this Court observed\n\nthus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        &quot;The executive have to reach their decisions by taking into account\n        relevant considerations. They should not refuse to consider\n        relevant matter nor should take into account wholly irrelevant or\n        extraneous consideration. They should not misdirect themselves on\n        a point of law. Only such a decision will be lawful. The courts\n        have power to see that the executive acts lawfully. It is no answer\n        to the exercise of that power to say that the executive acted bona\n        fide nor that they have bestowed painstaking consideration. They\n        cannot avoid scrutiny by courts by failing to give reasons. If they\n        give reasons that they are not good reasons, the courts can direct\n        them to reconsider the matter in the light of relevant matters,\n        though the propriety, adequacy or satisfactory character of those\n        reasons may not be open to judicial scrutiny. Even if the executive\n        considers it inexpedient to exercise their powers they should state\n        their reasons and there must be material to show that they have\n        considered all the relevant facts.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"465854\" id=\"span_26\">12.6) Thereafter the matter came up for consideration in <a href=\"/doc/465854/\" id=\"a_52\">Avon\n\nServices</a> (supra) relied upon by the High Court.

There must be some material before the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                          19</span>\n\n      Government on the basis of which it forms an opinion that an\n      industrial dispute exists or is apprehended. The power conferred on\n      the appropriate Government is an administrative power and the\n      action of the Government in making the reference is an\n      administrative act. The formation of an opinion as to the factual\n      existence of an industrial dispute as a preliminary step to the\n      discharge of its function does not make it any the less\n      administrative in character. Thus the jurisdictional facts on which\n      the appropriate Government may act are the formation of an\n      opinion that an industrial dispute exists or is apprehended which\n      undoubtedly is a subjective one, the next step of making reference\n      is an administrative act. The adequacy or sufficiency of the\n      material on which the opinion was formed is beyond the pale of\n      judicial scrutiny. If the action of the Government in making the\n      reference is impugned by a party it would be open to such a party\n      to show that what was referred was not an industrial dispute and\n      that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to make the Award but if the\n      dispute was an industrial dispute, its factual existence and the\n      expediency of making a reference in the circumstances of a\n      particular case are matters entirely for Government to decide upon,\n      and it will not be competent for the Court to hold the reference bad\n      and quash the proceedings for want of jurisdiction merely because\n      there was, in its opinion, no material before Government on which\n      it could have come to an affirmative conclusion on those matters.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      Merely because the government rejects a request for a reference or\n      declines to make a reference, it cannot be said that the industrial\n      dispute has ceased to exist......

The reasons given by the\n      Government would show that the Government examined the\n      relevant papers of enquiry and the Government was satisfied that it\n      was legally valid and that there was sufficient and adequate\n      evidence to hold the charges proved. It would further appear that\n      the Government was satisfied that the enquiry was not biased\n      against the workmen and the punishment was commensurate with\n      the gravity of the misconduct charged. All these relevant and vital\n      aspects have to be examined by the Industrial Tribunal while\n      adjudicating upon the reference made to it. In other words, the\n      reasons given by the Government would tantamount to\n      adjudication which is impermissible. That is the function of the\n      Tribunal and the Government cannot arrogate to itself that\n      function. Therefore if the grounds on which or the reasons for\n      which the Government declined to make a reference under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_55\">Section\n      10</a> are irrelevant, extraneous or not germane to the determination,\n      it is well settled that the party aggrieved thereby would be entitled\n      10 move the Court for a writ of mandamus. It is equally well\n      settled that where the Government purports to give reasons which\n      tantamount to adjudication and refuses to make a reference, the\n      appropriate Government could be said to have acted on extraneous,\n      irrelevant grounds or grounds not germane to the determination\n      and a writ of mandamus would lie calling upon the Government to\n      reconsider its decision.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1650782\" id=\"span_30\">12.8) In <a href=\"/doc/1650782/\" id=\"a_56\">Telco Convoy Drivers Mazdoor Sangh vs. State of Bihar</a>\n\n[1989 (3) SCC 271], this Court held that while exercising power under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_57\">section 10(1)</a> of the Act, the function of the appropriate government is\n\nan administrative function and not a judicial or quasi-judicial function.\n\nIn performing this administrative function the government cannot\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                    21</span>\n\n\ndelve into the merits of the dispute and take upon itself the\n\ndetermination of the lis, which would certainly be in excess of the\n\npower conferred on it by <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_58\">section 10</a> of the Act. However, there may\n\nbe exceptional cases in which the state government may, on a proper\n\nexamination of the demand, come to a conclusion that the demands\n\nare either perverse or frivolous and do not merit a reference. But the\n\ngovernment should be slow to attempt an examination of the demand\n\nwith a view to declining reference and courts will always be vigilant\n\nwhenever the government attempts to usurp the powers of the\n\nTribunal for adjudication of valid disputes, and to allow the\n\ngovernment to do so would be to render <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_59\">section 10</a> and <a href=\"/doc/476610/\" id=\"a_60\">section 12(5)</a>\n\nof the Act nugatory. Where, as in the instant case, the dispute is\n\nwhether the persons raising the dispute are workmen or not, the same\n\ncannot be decided by the government in exercise of its administrative\n\nfunction under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_61\">section 10(1)</a>. When the dispute was whether the\n\nconvoy drivers were employees or workmen of TELCO, that is to say,\n\nwhether there was relationship of employer and employees between\n\nTELCO and the convoy drivers, the Deputy Labour Commissioner\n\nand/or the state government was not justified in holding that the\n\nconvoy drivers were not workmen and accordingly, no reference\n\ncould be made.
