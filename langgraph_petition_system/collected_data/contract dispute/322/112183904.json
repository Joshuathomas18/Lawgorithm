Aditya Steel Industries\n\nLimited in favour of M/s. Granada Worldwide Investment\n\nCompany, London.      The appellant Bank of Baroda was the\n\nconfirming bank to the said letter of credit.    The Vysya Bank\n\nissued instructions to the London branch of the appellant on\n\n12.10.1992 to honour the letter of credit.        Acting on this\n\ninstruction the London branch of the appellant discounted the\n\nletter of credit for a sum of US $ 1,742,376.41 and payment of\n\nthis amount was made to M/s Granada Worldwide Investment\n\nCompany on 13.10.1992.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.   The appellant Bank of Baroda filed a suit against the Vysya\n\nBank for recovery of its dues on 19.04.1993 in London. This suit\n\nwas decreed by the High Court of Justice, Queens Bench,\n\nDivisional Commercial Court of London (hereinafter referred to as\n\nthe ‘London Court’) on 20.02.1995 and a decree for US\n\n$1,267,909.26 along with interest thereon was passed in favour\n\nof the appellant bank and against Vysya Bank. The decree was\n\nnot challenged and became final.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.   It appears that some talks went on between the two banks\n\nwith regard to the satisfaction of the decree.   On 28.08.1995,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                               2</span>\n\fVysya Bank placed an inter­bank deposit of US $ 1,400,000 with\n\nthe main branch of the Bank of Baroda on rollover basis with a\n\nrequest that the decree passed by the London Court be not\n\nexecuted. However, later in 2003 ING Vysya Bank, filed a petition\n\nbefore the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) for recovery of US\n\n$1,400,000. Those proceedings are being contested by the Bank\n\nof Baroda and it appears that the proceedings before the DRT are\n\nstill pending and we make it clear that anything said by us in this\n\nappeal will not affect those proceedings, since we are only dealing\n\nwith the issue of limitation for filing an execution petition of a\n\ndecree passed by a foreign court of a reciprocating country.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">6.   On 05.08.2009, the appellant bank filed an execution\n\npetition i.e. almost 14 years after the decree was passed by the\n\nLondon Court for execution of the same in terms of Section 44A\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_1\">Order 21 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_2\">CPC</a>) for recovery of Rs.16,43,88,187.86. This execution petition\n\nwas contested mainly on the ground that the same had not been\n\nfiled within the period of limitation. On 20.07.2013 the Additional\n\nCity Civil &amp; Session Judge, Bangalore dismissed the execution\n\npetition as time barred holding that <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 136</a> of the Limitation\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                3</span>\n\fAct, 1963 (for short ‘the Act’) applies and the execution petition\n\nshould have been filed within 12 years of the decree being passed\n\nby the London Court. Aggrieved, the bank approached the High\n\nCourt which vide judgment dated 13.11.2014 upheld the view of\n\nthe trial court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.   Sh. K. K. Venugopal, learned senior counsel appearing for\n\nthe appellant urged that the Act does not prescribe any period of\n\nlimitation for execution of a foreign decree passed in a\n\nreciprocating country.    He submits that in such eventuality\n\nprinciples of delay and laches as applicable to writ proceedings\n\nmay apply and, therefore, he has relied upon a long list of dates\n\nto show that the Bank of Baroda was pursuing the matter and\n\nwas trying its best to get the matter settled with Vysya Bank and\n\nurges that there is no delay in filing the petition.    His second\n\nsubmission is that since no limitation is provided under the Act,\n\nthe cause of action to file an execution petition arises only when a\n\npetition is filed under <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 44A</a> of the CPC which provides that\n\na decree passed by a court in a reciprocating country should be\n\ntreated as an Indian decree and, therefore, the limitation for 12\n\nyears provided under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 136</a> of the Act applies only from that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 4</span>\n\fdate because that is the date when the cause of action arises and\n\nthe decree is treated to be an Indian decree.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.   On the other hand, Mr. V.V.S. Rao, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the respondent urged that the law of limitation of\n\nEngland would apply in this case. It is undisputed that the\n\nlimitation period as per English law is 6 years for execution of a\n\ndecree, and hence the respondent’s submission is that the decree\n\nhaving been passed on 20.02.1995, no petition for execution of\n\nthat decree could be filed after 20.02.2001. The alternative\n\nargument of learned senior counsel for the respondent is that\n\neven if the Indian law of limitation were to apply, the limitation\n\nperiod for execution of a foreign decree would be determined as\n\nper <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 136</a> of the Act.      <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 44A</a> of the CPC clearly\n\nprovides that a decree passed in a reciprocating country should\n\nbe treated as an Indian decree and, therefore, the same must be\n\nenforced within 12 years from the date of passing of the decree as\n\nprovided by <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 136</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">9.   To appreciate the rival contentions of the parties, it would be\n\nnecessary to refer to <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 44A</a> of the CPC which reads as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                 5</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\f            “44A.

At the outset, we may note that the aforesaid section was\n\ninserted in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_12\">the CPC</a> in the year 1937.            Prior to that, a decree\n\npassed by any Court in a foreign country could not be executed in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    6</span>\n\fIndia and only a suit could be filed on the basis of the judgment\n\npassed by a foreign court. <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 44A</a> brought about a change\n\nin law in respect of reciprocating countries which agreed to\n\nrespect the judgments and decrees passed in each other’s courts.\n\nFrom a bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 44A</a> CPC it is crystal clear that it\n\napplies only to money decrees and not to other decrees.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">11.    Considering the rival arguments before us, the following\n\nissues arise for consideration:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       (i)     Does <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 44A</a> merely provide for manner of\n\n               execution of foreign decrees or does it also indicate the\n\n               period of limitation for filing execution proceedings for\n\n               the same?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      (ii) What is the period of limitation for executing a decree\n\n             passed by a foreign court (from a reciprocating country)\n\n             in India?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      (iii) From which date the period of limitation will run in\n\n             relation to a foreign decree (passed in a reciprocating\n\n             country) sought to be executed in India?\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Question No. 1</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     7</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\f12.   A careful analysis of <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 44A</a> hereinabove shows that a\n\ndecree passed by any superior court of a reciprocating territory\n\ncan be executed in India as if it had been passed by the District\n\nCourt before whom it is filed.       Sub­section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 44A</a>\n\ncasts an obligation on the person filing such application to file a\n\ncertified copy of the decree.        Such person must also file a\n\ncertificate from the superior court which passed the decree\n\nstating the extent, if any, to which the decree has been satisfied\n\nor adjusted.   This certificate shall be conclusive proof of the\n\nextent of such satisfaction/adjustment. Sub­section (3) provides\n\nthat from the date of filing of certified copy of the decree, the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/119552888/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 47</a> of CPC shall apply to such proceedings.\n\nThe District Court can refuse to execute any such decree if it falls\n\nwithin exceptions (a) to (f) of <a href=\"/doc/84779192/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 13</a>. The first Explanation\n\nprovides the definition of reciprocating territory and superior\n\ncourts. Explanation 2 is important which provides that a decree\n\nmust be a decree under which a sum of money is payable\n\nexcluding certain sums such as those payable as taxes, fines,\n\npenalties etc. and also excludes arbitration awards by the foreign\n\ncourts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                 8</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">\f13.      At the outset, we may note that we are not at all in\n\nagreement with the submission of Shri K.K. Venugopal that no\n\nlimitation is applicable.     These are not writ proceedings but\n\nexecution proceedings. The Act is a complete code in itself and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/80722670/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 3</a> clearly sets out that subject to the provisions contained\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/176775526/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 4</a> to Section 24 of the Act, every suit instituted, appeal\n\npreferred, and application made after the prescribed period shall\n\nbe dismissed even if limitation has not been set up as a defence.\n\nThe word ‘application’ used is wide enough to include an\n\napplication filed for execution of a decree, even a foreign decree.\n\nTherefore, the principles of delay and laches which may be\n\napplicable to writ proceedings cannot be applied to civil\n\nproceedings and are not at all attracted in proceedings filed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_22\">the CPC</a> which, in our opinion, must be filed within the\n\nprescribed period of limitation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"615695\" id=\"span_14\">14.      The main argument of Shri K.K. Venugopal is that limitation\n\nwill start running only after the petition under <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 44A</a> is\n\nfiled.    According to him, the cause of action for executing the\n\ndecree in India arises only after the application under <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_24\">Section\n\n44A</a> is filed. This view has also been taken by a Full Bench of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   9</span>\n\fMadras High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/615695/\" id=\"a_25\">Sheik Ali vs. Sheik\n\nMohamed1</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1421156\" id=\"span_16\">This view is however contrary to the view taken by\n\nthe Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1421156/\" id=\"a_26\">Lakhpat Rai Sharma vs.\n\nAtma Singh2</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">15.      We have carefully considered the matter and at the outset\n\nwe may note that there is no concept of cause of action in so far\n\nas an execution petition is concerned.       Cause of action is a\n\nconcept relating to civil suits and not to execution petitions.\n\nCause of action is nothing but a bundle of facts which gives rise\n\nto a legal right enabling the plaintiff to file a suit. On the other\n\nhand, a decree is a determination already made by a court on the\n\nbasis of a reasoned judgment.      In case of a decree it becomes\n\nenforceable the day it is passed. Therefore, we are clearly of the\n\nview that filing of an application under <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 44A</a> will not create\n\na fresh period for enforcing the decree.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">16.      We clarify that for the purpose of this judgment we have\n\nused the expressions, “cause country” which will mean the\n\ncountry in which the decree was issued (in this case England),\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">1</span>\n    AIR 1967 Mad 45\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">2</span>\n    AIR (58) 1971 P&amp;H 476\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 10</span>\n\fand “forum country” which would mean the country in which the\n\ndecree is sought to be executed (in this case India).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">17.   If we accept the view urged by Shri K.K. Venugopal, that the\n\ndate from which the limitation will be considered, will be the date\n\nof filing of certified copy of the decree it would lead to ludicrous\n\nresults. Taking the example of the present case, the limitation to\n\nexecute a decree in United Kingdom is 6 years. However, in India\n\nit is 12 years. The decree becomes enforceable on the date it was\n\npassed and, therefore, if the law of the cause country is to apply,\n\nthe limitation would be 6 years and if the law of forum country\n\nwere to apply, it would be 12 years. If the view urged is accepted\n\nthen the decree holder can keep silent for 100 years and,\n\nthereafter, file a certified copy of the decree and the certificate\n\nand then claim that the decree can be executed.         That would\n\nmake a mockery of the legal process not only of the cause country\n\nbut also of the forum country. The clock of limitation cannot be\n\nkept in abeyance for 100 years at the choice of the decree holder.\n\nWe, therefore, reject this contention.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">18.   The main argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that\n\nsub­section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 44A</a> is a deeming provision which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                 11</span>\n\fprovides that the decree shall be executed as if it had been\n\npassed by an Indian court.                   It is urged that this deeming\n\nprovision should be given its full meaning and when the statute\n\ndirects an imaginary state of affairs to be taken as real, one\n\nshould imagine also as real the consequences and incidents\n\nwhich flow from the same.                  Reference has been made to the\n\njudgment in East End Dwellings Co.

There is also the issue of conflict of laws between the cause\n\ncountry and the forum country.         As far as the present case is\n\nconcerned, it is not disputed that the limitation for executing a\n\ndecree in England is 6 years in terms of <a href=\"/doc/769768/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 24</a> of the\n\nLimitation Act of 1980 of the United Kingdom. Rule 40.7 of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                  16</span>\n\fCivil Procedure Rules of England provides that a judgment or\n\norder takes effect from the date it is given or made or such later\n\ndate as the court may specify.       The decree therefore becomes\n\nenforceable on the date when it was passed and as far as this\n\ncase is concerned, the date of passing of the decree is\n\n20.02.1995.    If the limitation is 6 years then obviously the\n\nexecution petition should have been filed on or before 20.02.2001\n\nand if the limitation was 12 years in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 136</a> of the\n\nAct, the execution petition would still be barred by limitation as\n\nthe execution petition was filed in 2009.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">25.   There is increasing interaction and interplay between the\n\npeople across the globe. There are more and more international\n\nbusiness deals being done. There is an increasing exchange of\n\nviews in the fields of art, literature, sports, etc. Goods are sold\n\nacross the world, online. All these could lead to litigation, which\n\nmay have the cause in one country but the judgment debtor may\n\nnot have any property in that cause country and the decree­holder\n\nwould have to go to another country (forum country) to take\n\nbenefit of the decree.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                17</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\f26.    The earlier view was that the law of limitation being a\n\nprocedural law, the law of the forum country would govern the\n\nfield. This is reflected in Dicey’s observations in ‘Conflict of Laws’,\n\n6th Edition7, where it has been said as follows:\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                       “Whilst, however, it is certain that all matters\n                  which concern procedure are in an English court\n                  governed by the law of England, it is equally clear\n                  that everything which goes to the substance of a\n                  party’s rights and does not concern procedure is\n                  governed by the law appropriate to the case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                       Our Rule is clear and well established. The\n                  difficulty of its application to a given case lies in\n                  discriminating between matters which belong to\n                  procedure and matters which affect the substantive\n                  rights of the parties. In the determination of this\n                  question two considerations must be borne in mind:­\n                  (1) English lawyers give the widest possible\n                  extension to the meaning of the term ‘procedure’.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1311503\" id=\"span_36\">The expression, as interpreted by our judges,\n                  includes all legal remedies, and everything\n                  connected with the enforcement of a right.

Indian Courts have normally taken the view that the law of\n\nlimitation is a procedural law. We may point out that in Dicey’s\n\n‘Conflict of Laws’ 14th Edition9, the view taken is entirely different.\n\nThe present thinking appears to be that law of limitation is not\n\nprocedural, especially when it leads to extinguishment of rights or\n\nremedies. Hence, it cannot be termed as a procedural law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">28.    At this stage we may refer to Dicey’s Conflict of Laws 14 th\n\nEdn. which has summarised this change in view in the following\n\nwords:­\n\n               “The traditional approach has been thrown into some\n               doubt by decisions in Australia and Canada. In John\n               Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v. Rogerson, the High Court of Australia\n               indicated (obiter) that, at common law, statutes of\n               limitation are substantive, rather than procedural. In\n               Tolofson v. Jensen the Supreme Court of Canada\n               rejected the traditional common law classification of\n               statutes of limitation and the distinction between right\n               and remedy on which it is based and held that statutes\n               of limitation are to be classified as substantive. This\n               approach was confirmed in Castillo v. Castillo. The\n               Supreme Court applied a one year limitation period\n               under the law applicable to the tort, Californian law,\n               despite a provision of Alberta law which provided that\n               Alberta limitation law (which had a two year period)\n               should apply “notwithstanding that, in accordance\n               with conflict of law rules, the claim will be adjudicated\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">8</span>\n AIR 1964 Mad 221\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">9</span>\n Sir Lawrence Collins et. al., “Dicey, Morris, &amp; Collins on The Conflict of Laws”, 14 th Edn.,\nSweet &amp; Maxwell pp. 198-199 (2006).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                              19</span>\n\f          under the substantive law of another jurisdiction.” A\n          majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that this\n          provision had no application because the claim was\n          already time­barred when the action was brought.”\n\nEven in relation to England it was observed:­\n\n          “Under the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984. <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_56\">The\n          Act</a> was based on the recommendations of the Law\n          Commission. It adopts the general principle, subject to\n          an exception based on public policy, that the limitation\n          rules of the lex causae are to be applied in actions in\n          England, even if those rules do not lay down any\n          limitation period for the claim. English limitation rules\n          are not to be applied unless English law is the lex\n          causae or one of two leges causae governing the\n          matter….”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">29.   This change in view can also be noted in the works of other\n\nauthors. In Cheshire &amp; North’s Private International Law (10 th\n\nEdn.) it can be seen that as per the older rules, the limitation of\n\nEnglish law would apply. Hence a claim would be allowed in\n\nEngland if it fell within the limitation period prescribed in its\n\nlaws, even if the action was time­barred as per the foreign law\n\napplicable to the transaction/contract/dispute in question.\n\nHowever, this raised various issues which were also highlighted.\n\nIt would be apposite to refer to the following paragraphs:­\n\n          “(I)   The time within which an action must be brought\n          English law is unfortunately committed to the view\n          that statutes of limitation, if they merely specify a\n          certain time after which rights cannot be enforced by\n          action, affect procedure, not substance. They concern,\n          it is said, not the merits of the cause, but the manner\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                   20</span>\n\f          in which the remedy must be pursued. They ordain\n          that the procedure of the court is available only when\n          set in motion within a certain fixed time after the cause\n          of action arose. In the result, therefore, any relevant\n          statute of limitation that obtains in the lex fori may be\n          pleaded, while a statute of some foreign law, even\n          though it belongs to the proper law of the transaction,\n          must be disregarded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">          xxx                     xxx                       xxx\n          The rules of English private international law upon\n          this matter, however, pay little attention to the proper\n          law of the transaction that is in issue. Thus in a report\n          of a judgment by ROCHE, J., it is said: “Foreign courts\n          might have decided that the laws of limitation were\n          part of the substantive law, but he was unable to apply\n          them as such.” The result of this attitude is twofold.\n          Firstly, an English statute of limitation is a good idea\n          plea to an action brought in England, notwithstanding\n          that the action is still maintainable according to the\n          proper law of the transaction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">          xxx                      xxx                      xxx\n          Secondly, the extinction of the right of action by the\n          proper law of the transaction is not a bar to an action\n          in England. In other words, if the permissible period is\n          longer in England than in the foreign country the\n          plaintiff is at liberty to sustain his action here.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">30.   In Cheshire &amp; North’s Private International Law (15 th\n\nEdition) it is noted that this change of applying the law of\n\nlimitation as applicable in the cause country whose law applies to\n\nthe transaction/contract/dispute was a welcome one. The\n\nfollowing paragraphs are relevant:­\n\n          “(a) The time within which a action must be brought\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                   21</span>\n\fUntil 1984, English law was committed to the view that\nstatutes of limitation, if they merely specified a certain\ntime after which rights could not be enforced by actin,\naffected procedure and not substance. This meant\nthat limitation was governed by English law, as the law\nof the forum, and any limitation provision of the\napplicable law was ignored. Where, however, it could\nbe shown that the effect of a statute of limitation of the\nforeign applicable law was not just to bar the plaintiff’s\nremedy, but also to extinguish his cause of action,\nthen the English courts would be prepared to regard\nthe foreign rule as substantive and to be applied in\nEngland.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">The common law rule, which has been criticised in a\nnumber of common law jurisdictions, tends to have no\ncounterpart in civil law countries which usually treat\nstatutes of limitations as substantive. Furthermore,\nthe Contracts (Applicable Law) Act 1990, implementing\nthe European Community Convention on the Law\nApplicable to Contractual Obligations (1980), provides\nthat the law which governs the essential validity of a\ncontract is to govern “the various ways of extinguishing\nobligations, and prescription and limitation of actions”.\nIn 1982 the Law Commission concluded that “there is\na clear case for the reform of the present English rule”\nand their recommendations formed the basis of the\nForeign Limitation Periods Act 1984.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">The general principle of the 1984 Act abandons the\ncommon law approach which favoured the application\nof the domestic law of limitation. Instead, the English\ncourt is to apply the law which governs the substantive\nissue according to English choice of law rules, and this\nnew approach is applied to both actions and\narbitrations in England. In the case of those few tort\nclaims, such as defamation, to which the common law\nchoice of law rules still apply, English law, as the law\nof the forum, will remain relevant because of the choice\nof law rule which requires actionability both by the law\nof the forum and by the law of the place of the tort. The\ncorollary of the main rule is that English law is no\nlonger automatically to be applied. There is, of course,\na significant difference between a rule under which a\nclaim is to be held to be statute barred in England if\nstatute barred under the governing law, a reform which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                          22</span>\n\f          seems widely to be welcomed, and a further rule that,\n          if the claim is not statute barred abroad, it must be\n          allowed to proceed in England.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">31.   The old position under common law was that limitation was\n\ntreated as a procedural law.            In countries following civil\n\njurisdiction, the law of limitation has never been treated as a\n\nprocedural law but as a substantive law. In recent years, almost\n\nall the common law countries have either brought a new\n\nlegislation or by judicial decisions have now taken the view that\n\nthe law of limitation cannot be treated as a purely procedural\n\nlaw. We may make reference to the law in the United Kingdom\n\nand the United States of America.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">32.   Section 1 of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act, 1984 as\n\napplicable to the United Kingdom reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">          “Application of foreign limitation law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          1. – (1) Subject to the following provisions of this Act,\n          where in any action or proceedings in a court in\n          England and Wales the law of any other country falls\n          (in accordance with rules of private international law\n          applicable by any such court) to be taken into account\n          in the determination of any matter—\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">             (a) the law of that other country relating to\n             limitation shall apply in respect of that matter for\n             the purposes of the action or proceedings, subject\n             to sections 1A and 1B; and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                   23</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\f             (b) except where that matter falls within subsection\n             (2) below, the law of England and Wales relating to\n             limitation shall not so apply.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">          (2) A matter falls within this subsection if it is a matter\n          in the determination of which both the law of England\n          and Wales and the law of some other country fall to be\n          taken into account.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">          (3) The law of England and Wales shall determine for\n          the purposes of any law applicable by virtue of\n          subsection (1)(a) above whether, and the time at which,\n          proceedings have been commenced in respect of any\n          matter; and, accordingly, <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_57\">section 35</a> of the Limitation\n          Act 1980 (new claims in pending proceedings) shall\n          apply in relation to time limits applicable by virtue of\n          subsection (1)(a) above as it applies in relation to time\n          limits under that Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">          (4) A court in England and Wales, in exercising in\n          pursuance of subsection (1)(a) above any discretion\n          conferred by the law of any other country, shall so far\n          as practicable exercise that discretion in the manner in\n          which it is exercised in comparable cases by the courts\n          of that other country.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">          (5) In this section “law”, in relation to any country,\n          shall not include rules of private international law\n          applicable by the courts of that country or, in the case\n          of England and Wales, this Act.”\n\n\nSeveral States in the United States of America have adopted the\n\nUniform Conflict of Laws Limitation Act, 1982 evolved by the\n\nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103447/\" id=\"a_58\">Sections 2</a> and <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_59\">3</a> of this Act read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">          “<a href=\"/doc/103447/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 2</a>: (a) Except as provided by sec 4, if a claim is\n          substantively based:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">               (1) upon the law of one other state, the limitation\n               period of that state applies; or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                    24</span>\n\f                (2) upon the law of more than one state, the\n                limitation period of one of those states chosen by\n                the law of conflicts of laws of this State, applies.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           (b) The limitation period of this State applies to all\n           other claims.”\n           “<a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 3</a>: If the statute of limitations of another state\n           applies to the assertion of a claim in this State, the\n           other States’ relevant statutes and other rules of law\n           governing tolling and accrual apply in computing the\n           limitation period, but its statutes and other rules of\n           law governing conflict of laws do not apply.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">33.   The view worldwide appears to be that the limitation law of\n\nthe cause country should be applied even in the forum country.\n\nFurthermore, we are of the view that in those cases where the\n\nremedy stands extinguished in the cause country it virtually\n\nextinguishes the right of the decree­holder to execute the decree\n\nand creates a corresponding right in the judgment debtor to\n\nchallenge the execution of the decree.            These are substantive\n\nrights and cannot be termed to be procedural. As India becomes\n\na global player in the international business arena, it cannot be\n\none of the few countries where the law of limitation is considered\n\nentirely procedural.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">34.   We have already clearly indicated that if the law of a forum\n\ncountry is silent with regard to the limitation prescribed for\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                     25</span>\n\fexecution of a foreign decree then the limitation of the cause\n\ncountry would apply.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">35.   We answer question no. 2 by holding that the limitation\n\nperiod for executing a decree passed by a foreign court (from\n\nreciprocating country) in India will be the limitation prescribed in\n\nthe reciprocating foreign country. Obviously this will be subject to\n\nthe decree being executable in terms of <a href=\"/doc/84779192/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 13</a> of the CPC.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Question No. 3</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">36.   Coming to the third question, as far as <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 136</a> of the Act\n\nis concerned, we are of the view that the same only deals with\n\ndecrees passed by Indian courts.        <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_64\">The Limitation Act</a> has been\n\nframed mainly keeping in view the suits, appeals and applications\n\nto be filed in Indian courts and wherever the need was felt to deal\n\nwith something outside <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_65\">India, the Limitation Act</a> specifically deals\n\nwith that situation. We may refer to <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 39</a> of the Act which\n\nspecifically deals with dishonoured foreign bills.      <a href=\"/doc/1185201/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 101</a> of\n\nthe Act deals with suits filed upon a judgment including a foreign\n\njudgment.    The   framers   of   the   Act   specifically   mentioned\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                  26</span>\n\f‘including a foreign judgment’ in <a href=\"/doc/1185201/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 101</a> of this very Schedule\n\nwhich is part of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">37.   When dealing with the applications for execution of decrees\n\nthe law makers could have easily said ‘including foreign decrees’.\n\nThis having not been said, it appears that the intention of the\n\nlegislature was that <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 136</a> would be confined to decrees of\n\nIndian courts.   Furthermore, <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 136</a> clearly states that the\n\ndecree or order should be of a civil court. A civil court, as defined\n\nin India, may not be the same as in a foreign jurisdiction. We\n\nmust also note the fact that the new <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_71\">Limitation Act</a> was enacted\n\nin 1963 and presumably the law makers were aware of the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 44A</a> of the CPC. When they kept silent on\n\nthis aspect, the only inference that can be drawn is that <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_73\">Article\n\n136</a> only deals with decrees passed by Indian civil courts.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">38.   Having said so, we are clearly of the view that some\n\nclarification needs to be given with regard to the period in which\n\nan application under Section 44A can be filed.        In this regard,\n\nwhen we read sub­section (1) and sub­section (2) of Section 44A\n\ntogether it is obvious that what is required to be filed is a certified\n\ncopy of the decree in terms of sub­section (1) and also a certificate\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                  27</span>\n\ffrom the court in the cause country stating the extent, if any, to\n\nwhich the decree has been satisfied or adjusted. These are the\n\ntwin requirements and no foreign decree can be executed unless\n\nboth the requirements are met. It is essential to file not only a\n\ncertified copy of the decree but also the certificate in terms of\n\nsub­section (2). That, however, does not mean that nothing else\n\nhas to be filed.   The only inference is that the decree can be\n\nexecuted only once these documents are filed. The executing\n\ncourt cannot execute this decree and certificate unless the decree\n\nholder also provides various details of the judgment debtor that\n\nis, his address, etc. in India and the details of the property of the\n\njudgment debtor. These particulars will have to be provided by a\n\nwritten application filed in terms of clause (2) of Rule 11 of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_74\">Order\n\n21 of the CPC</a> which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">            (2) Written application. – Save as otherwise\n            provided by sub­rule (1), every application for the\n            execution of a decree shall be in writing, signed and\n            verified by the applicant or by some other person\n            proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be\n            acquainted with the facts of the case, and shall\n            contain in a tabular form the following particulars,\n            namely :­\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">            (a) the number of the suit;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">            (b) the names of the parties;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">            (c) the date of the decree;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">            (d) whether any, appeal has been preferred from the\n            decree;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                  28</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\f             (e) whether any, and (if any) what, payment or other\n             adjustment of the matter in controversy has been\n             made between the parties subsequently to the\n             decree;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">             (f) whether any, and (if any) what, previous\n             applications have been made for the execution of the\n             decree, the dates of such applications and their\n             results;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">             (g) the amount with interest (if any) due upon the\n             decree, or other relief granted thereby, together with\n             particulars of any cross­decree, whether passed\n             before or after the date of the decree sought to be\n             executed;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">             (h) the amount of the costs (if any) awarded;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">             (i) the name of the person against whom execution of\n             the decree is sought; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">             (j) the mode in which the assistance of the Court is\n             required whether­\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                 (i) by the delivery of any property specifically\n                 decreed;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                 (ii) by the attachment, or by the attachment and\n                 sale, or by the sale without attachment, of any\n                 property;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                 (iii) by the arrest and detention in prison of any\n                 person;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                 (iv) by the appointment of a receiver;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                 (v) otherwise, as the nature of the relief granted\n                 may require.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">39.   Therefore, a party filing a petition for execution of a foreign\n\ndecree must also necessarily file a written application in terms of\n\nOrder 21 Rule 11 clause (2) quoted hereinabove. Without such\n\nan application it will be impossible for the Court to execute the\n\ndecree. In our opinion, therefore, this application for executing a\n\nforeign decree will be an application not covered under any other\n\narticle of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_75\">Limitation Act</a> and would thus be covered under\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                    29</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_77\">Limitation Act</a> and the applicable limitation\n\nwould be 3 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">40.   The question that then arises is that from which date the\n\nlimitation starts. We can envisage of 2 situations only. The first\n\nsituation is one where the decree holder does not take any steps\n\nfor execution of the decree during the period of limitation\n\nprescribed in the cause country for execution of decrees in that\n\ncountry.   In such a case he has lost his right to execute the\n\ndecree in the country where the cause of action arose. It would\n\nbe a travesty of justice if the person having lost his rights to\n\nexecute the decree in the cause country is permitted to execute\n\nthe decree in a forum country. This would be against the principle\n\nwhich we have accepted, that the law of limitation is not merely a\n\nprocedural law.     This would mean that a person who has lost\n\nhis/her right or remedy to execute the foreign decree in the court\n\nwhere the decree was passed could take benefit of the provisions\n\nof the Indian law for extending the period of limitation. In the\n\nfacts of the present case, the limitation in India is 12 years for\n\nexecuting a money decree whereas in England it is 6 years. There\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                30</span>\n\fmay be countries where the limitation for executing such a decree\n\nmay be more than 12 years. The right of the litigant in the latter\n\nsituation would not come to an end at 12 years and it would\n\nabide by the law of limitation of the cause country which passed\n\nthe decree. Hence, limitation would start running from the date\n\nthe decree was passed in the cause country and the period of\n\nlimitation prescribed in the forum country would not apply. In\n\ncase the decree holder does not take any steps to execute the\n\ndecree in the cause country within the period of limitation\n\nprescribed in the country of the cause, it cannot come to the\n\nforum country and plead a new cause of action or plead that the\n\nlimitation of the forum country should apply.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">41.   The second situation is when a decree holder takes steps­in­\n\naid to execute the decree in the cause country. The proceedings\n\nin execution may go on for some time, and the decree may be\n\nexecuted, satisfied partly but not fully. The judgment debtor may\n\nnot have sufficient property or funds in the cause country to\n\nsatisfy the decree etc. In such eventuality what would be done?\n\nIn our considered view, in such circumstances the right to apply\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                31</span>\n\funder      Section   44A   will   accrue   only   after   the   execution\n\nproceedings in the cause country are finalised and the application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/51234069/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 44A</a> of the CPC can be filed within 3 years of the\n\nfinalisation of the execution proceedings in the cause country as\n\nprescribed by <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 137</a> of the Act.        The decree holder must\n\napproach the Indian court along with the certified copy of the\n\ndecree and the requisite certificate within this period of 3 years.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">42.   It is clarified that applying in the cause country for a\n\ncertified copy of the decree or the certificate of part­satisfaction, if\n\nany, of the decree, as required by Section 44A will not\n\ntantamount to step­in­aid to execute the decree in the cause\n\ncountry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">43.   We answer the third question accordingly and hold that the\n\nperiod of limitation would start running from the date the decree\n\nwas passed in the foreign court of a reciprocating country.\n\nHowever, if the decree holder first takes steps­in­aid to execute\n\nthe decree in the cause country, and the decree is not fully\n\nsatisfied, then he can then file a petition for execution in India\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                    32</span>\n\fwithin a period of 3 years from the finalisation of the execution\n\nproceedings in the cause country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">44.   In view of the discussion above we dismiss the appeal and\n\nuphold the orders of both the Courts below, though for different\n\nreasons. No order as to costs.
