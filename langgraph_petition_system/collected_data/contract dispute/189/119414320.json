The Tribunal gets the jurisdiction to adjudicate the\ndispute under the Act, but for the Act, it would have no\njurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute in relation to works\ncontract.    It is well settled in law that where a tribunal\nderives its jurisdiction from the statute that creates it and\nthat statute also defines the conditions under which the\ntribunal can function, it goes without saying that before\nthat tribunal assumes jurisdiction in a matter, it must be\nsatisfied that the conditions requisite for its acquiring\nseisin of that matter have in fact arisen. Wherever\njurisdiction is given to a court by an Act of Legislature and\nsuch jurisdiction is only given upon certain specified terms\ncontained in that Act it is a universal principle that these\nterms must be complied with, in order to create and raise\nthe jurisdiction for if they be not complied with, the\njurisdiction does not arise. [See: <a href=\"/doc/157214/\" id=\"a_16\">Mohammed Hasnuddin\nvs. State of Maharashtra</a>, AIR 1979 SC 404]. In view of\naforesaid enunciation of law, it is apparent that in case\nwhere an agreement provides for clause like Clause 29,\nthe jurisdiction of the Tribunal can be invoked only after\napproaching the authority as provided under the terms of\nthe work contract.       Section 7-B(1) in express terms\nprovides that the Tribunal shall not admit a reference\npetition unless the dispute is first referred for decision of\nthe final authority under the terms of the contract and that\nthe petition to the Tribunal is made within one year from\nthe date of communication of the decision of the final\nauthority.   The proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 7-B\nprovides that if the final authority fails to decide the\ndispute within the period of six months from the date of\nreference to it, the petition to the Tribunal shall be made\nwithin one year of the expiry of said period of six months.\nThus, it is necessary for an person aggrieved to approach\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  9</span>\n\nthe authority under the terms of the work contract before\nfiling    the   reference   petition.   On   fulfillment   of   the\nconditions mentioned in the terms of the works contract\nalone as provided in <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_17\">section 7-B(1)</a> of the Act, the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal can be invoked by filing a\nreference petition.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">7.       There may be cases where the works contract may\nnot contain any provision for dispute redressal like the one\nprovided in Clause 29 of the Agreement. In such a case,\nsub-section 2-A of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act will apply and an\naggrieved person can approach the Tribunal within three\nyears from the date on which the works contract is\nterminated, foreclosed, abandoned or comes to an end in\nany other manner or when a dispute arises during the\npendency of the works contract. It is pertinent to note that\nSection 7-B(2-A) as it exists today has come into force\nw.e.f. 29.8.2005. The aforesaid provisions does not have\nretrospective operation as the language employed therein\ndoes not even remotely suggest so, as has been held by\nthe Full Bench in its order dated 27.10.2009.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_13\">8.       There may be disputes under the agreements which\ndo not contain a clause like Clause 29 in the agreement\nwhich may have arisen prior to coming into force of\nSection 7-B(2-A).      In such a case, the claimant has to\napproach the Tribunal within a period of three years from\nthe date of accrual of cause of action. The Supreme Court\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/1189990/\" id=\"a_19\">State of M.P. Vs. Anshuman Shukla</a>,\n(2008) 7 SCC 487, while disagreeing with the view taken\nby another Bench of equal strength in the case of Nagar\nPalika Parishad, Morena Vs. Agrawal Construction,\n(2004) 2 M.P.J.R. 374 has referred the issue with regard to\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 5</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 10</span>\n\nproceedings before the Tribunal for consideration by the\nlarger Bench. The Supreme Court while referring the\nmatter has held that the Tribunal under the Act has to\ndetermine a lis. There are two parties before it. It has\npower to summon records and to record evidence. It&#x27;s\naward is executable as a decree of Court. Its proceedings\nare judicial proceedings subject to the revisional order\nwhich may be passed by the High Court. Thus for all\nintents and purposes, the Tribunal under the Act is a Court.\nThough we are conscious that the aforesaid matter has\nbeen referred to a larger Bench, yet the reference has not\nbeen answered.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_15\">In view of the finding recorded by the\nDivision Bench of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1189990/\" id=\"a_21\">Anshuman\nShukla</a> (supra) that Tribunal under the Act is the Court,\nwhich of course is subject to final adjudication by the\nSupreme    Court,   the   fixation     of   the    time   limit   for\napproaching the Tribunal as three years in such cases\nwould also be in conformity with <a href=\"/doc/10691/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 113</a> of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_23\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1786180\" id=\"span_16\">9.

It provides that the\ndispute has to be referred to the Superintending Engineer\nin writing for decision within a period of 30 days from such\noccurrence. Thereupon, the Superintending Engineer shall\ngive his written instructions or decision within a period of\n60 days of such request. If the Superintending Engineer\nfails to give his instructions in writing within a period of 60\ndays or mutually agreed time after being requested of, an\naggrieved party may file an appeal to the Chief Engineer\nwithin 30 days and shall give his decision within a period of\n90 days.   Thereafter, an aggrieved person can approach\nthe   Tribunal   within   one        year   from    the   date    of\ncommunication of decision of the final authority.            If the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               11</span>\n\nfinal authority fails to decide the dispute within a period of\nsix months from the date of reference to it, the petition to\nthe Tribunal shall be made within one year of the expiry\nperiod of six months. The contention made on behalf of\nthe applicants that in view of sub-section (2-A) of Section\n7-B, an aggrieved person can approach the Tribunal\ndirectly without approaching the authorities mentioned in\nClause 29 of the agreement, cannot be accepted as the\nsame would obliterate the provisions of sub-section (1) of\nSection 7-B and would render the same otiose as it is well\nsettled legal proposition that it is incumbent on the Court\nto avoid a construction if reasonably permissible on the\nlanguage which would render part of the statute devoid of\nany meaning or application. [See: <a href=\"/doc/1786180/\" id=\"a_24\">Rao Shiv Bahadur\nSingh vs. State of U.P.</a>, AIR 1953 SC 394]</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">10.   If the   agreement is rescinded, two questions may\narise for consideration.      Firstly, which party to the\nagreement is at fault and consequently, the claim for\ndamages for breach of contract. Secondly, the claim with\nregard to payment of the amount of the final bill before\nrecission of the contract in accordance with the rates\nprescribed in the agreement.        In the first case, the\nlimitation would commence from the date when the\nagreement is rescinded whereas in the second case, the\nlimitation would commence from the date when the final\nbill is prepared.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"268412\" id=\"span_18\">11.   It was also submitted on behalf of the petitioners that\nthe time limit prescribed in Clause 29 is not mandatory\nand therefore, the same need not be adhered to strictly.\nWe are not inclined to accept the aforesaid submission as\nnon-submission of timely claims is likely to result in\ndisappearance or destruction of the evidence.       A person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                              12</span>\n\ncannot be permitted to approach the authority at any time\nwhich he chooses. It is also relevant to mention here that\nthe applicants have entered into an agreement with the\nState Government with open eyes and they cannot be\npermitted now to contend that it is not necessary to\nadhere to the time schedule provided for redressal of their\ngrievances under clause 29 of the agreement. Similarly,\nthe contention that aggrieved person can approach the\nSuperintending Engineer as well as the Chief Engineer\nwithin a period of three years as provided in <a href=\"/doc/10691/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 113</a> of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_26\">Limitation Act</a> also cannot be accepted as it is well\nsettled in law that provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_27\">Limitation Act</a> apply to\nCourts only and the authorities under the agreement are\nadmittedly not the Courts.     [See: <a href=\"/doc/268412/\" id=\"a_28\">State of Jharkhand\nand others vs. Shivam Coke Industries, Dhanbad\nand others</a>, (2011) 8 SCC 656].</span>      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1783243\" id=\"span_20\">For yet another reason,\nthis submission cannot be accepted, as the Division Bench\ndecision in M/s.Sermen <a href=\"/doc/1783243/\" id=\"a_29\">India Road Makers Pvt.

State of M.P.</a>, 2005 (3) M.P.H.T. 292 has been over-\nruled by the Full Bench vide order dated 27.10.2009 and it\nhas been held that it would not be correct to say that the\nclaimant can raise the dispute within three years before\nthe final authority from the date of accrual of cause of\naction.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">12.   Now we may advert to the impact of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 28</a> of\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872 on clause 29 of the\nagreement.    It is not open to the parties to reduce or\nenlarge the limitation prescribed by the statute for\ninitiation of legal proceedings but it is open to the parties\nto agree that by some agreed act or omission by one party\nto an agreement within the time stipulated in the\nagreement, the rights of that party under the agreement\nshall stand extinguished. However, in view of sub-section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                13</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">(b) of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 28</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as\namended w.e.f. 8.1.1997 such extinguishment of right\ncannot be made dependent on mere lapse of a party by\nprescribing limitation lesser than the limitation prescribed\nby the statute for the simple reason that what cannot be\ndone directly i.e. reduction of statutory period of limitation\ncannot be allowed to be done indirectly.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">13.     In view of the preceding analysis, we proceed to\nstate our conclusions as under: -\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(i)     Where the works contract contains a clause like\nClause 29, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal can be invoked\nonly after approaching the Authority as provided under the\nterms of the works contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(ii)    However, subject to final adjudication of the issue by\nthe Supreme Court as to whether Tribunal under the Act is\na Court or not, in case where the dispute has arisen under\nan agreement prior to coming into force of Section 7-B(2-\n<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_32\">A) of the Act</a> which does not contain a clause like Clause\n29,     an aggrieved person has to approach the Tribunal\nwithin a period of three years from the date of accrual of\ncause of action.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(iii)   Where the works contract does not contain any\nprovision like Clause 29 and the dispute has arisen after\ncoming into force of Section 7-B(2-<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_33\">A) of the Act</a>, in such a\ncase, sub-section (2-A) of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 7-B</a> of the Act will apply\nand an aggrieved person can approach the Tribunal within\na period of three years from the date on which the works\ncontract is terminated, foreclosed, abandoned or comes to\nan end in any other manner or when a dispute arises\nduring the pendency of the works contract.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               14</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(iv)   In a case where the agreement is rescinded, two\nquestions may arise for consideration. Firstly, which party\nto the agreement is at fault and consequently, claim for\ndamages for breach of contract. Secondly, the claim with\nregard to payment of amount of the final bill before\nrecission of the contract in accordance with the rates\nprescribed in the agreement.        In the first case, the\nlimitation would commence from the date when the\nagreement is rescinded whereas in the second case, the\nlimitation would commence from the date when the final\nbill is prepared.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(v)    The dispute under Clause 29 has to be submitted\nwithin the time limit which has been prescribed in the\nclause.
