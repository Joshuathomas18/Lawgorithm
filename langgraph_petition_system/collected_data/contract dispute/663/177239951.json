The\n\npetitioner is an engineering company, said to be engaged in the\n\nexecution of piling, civil and structural works and has claimed to\n\nhave executed numerous projects in India and abroad. The\n\ngrievance of the petitioner is with regard to the impugned action\n\ntaken by the 1st respondent in cancelling the petitioner&#x27;s bid on\n\nadministrative reasons as per the impugned Ext.P-18 proceedings,\n\nafter having admitted its bid, as the lowest tender (L1), in the matter\n\nof award of the construction contract, as per Ext.P-15. The\n\npetitioner would also raise a consequential grievance against the\n\nimpugned Ext.P-21 revised tender notification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">      2.   The brief facts of the case are that the 1st respondent\n\nKerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC), which is a\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P.(C).13058/16                     -: 2 :-</span>\n\nGovernment       company        owned      fully    by   the    1st   respondent\n\nGovernment of Kerala, had earlier published Ext.P-1 e-tender\n\nnotification on 2.10.2015 inviting tenders from interested persons\n\nfor the &quot;construction of Innovation cum Incubation Tower and allied works for the Life\n\nScience Park, Thonnakkal, Thiruvananthapuram&quot; The estimated value of the\n\ncontract is mentioned as Rs.129,67,13,495 (Rupees one hundred\n\nand twenty nine crores, sixty seven lakhs, thirteen thousand four\n\nhundred and ninety five only). The last date of the submission of the\n\nsaid tender was extended twice. The petitioner, as discernible from\n\nExt.P-8, had submitted the e-tender on 20.11.2015. That out of\n\nthe total 7 bidders, the petitioner and 5 other (thus totalling to 6)\n\nwere declared as pre-qualified on the opening of the technical bids.\n\nThereafter, the financial bids were opened on 4.12.2015 and the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s bid, which was 6.5% below the estimated value, was\n\nfound to be the lowest bid and as per Exts.P-14 dated 4.12.2015\n\nand P-15 dated 4.12.2015, the petitioner&#x27;s bid was admitted as the\n\nlowest tender (L1) among the 6 pre-qualified bids. Since nothing\n\nwas heard for quite some time from the issuance of Ext.P-15 dated\n\n4.12.2015,      the     petitioner     had      submitted     Ext.P-16        dated\n\n26.12.2015, requesting for a meeting on 4th or 5th of January, 2016.\n\nMuch thereafter, the 2nd respondent had issued the impugned\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 3 :-</span>\n\nExt.P-18 proceedings dated 2.3.2016 informing the petitioner that\n\nthe tender has been cancelled due to administrative reasons, etc.\n\nThe petitioner thereafter had immediately submitted Ext.P-19\n\nrepresentation dated 3.3.2016 to the 1st respondent Corporation,\n\ninter alia, pointing out therein that the bidders were required only\n\nto quote above or below the price indicated in the tender and as\n\ninformed earlier by the 2nd respondent, even if there is any\n\ndifference or error, in arriving estimated quantities in the tender,\n\nthere may not be any requirement for revision of the estimated\n\nvalue, since the payments were to be made only for the executed\n\nquantity of work and that the petitioner is willing to execute the\n\nwork at the rate quoted by them even for the reduced estimated\n\nvalue and that they object the cancellation of the tender without\n\nassigning any tangible reason and to reconsider the decision taken\n\nin Ext.P-18 to cancel the tender and to issue work order to the\n\npetitioner, etc.  That pursuant to the issuance of the impugned\n\nExt.P-18 proceedings dated 2.3.2013, the 2nd respondent had\n\nissued the impugned Ext.P-21 revised tender notification dated\n\n3.3.2016. The petitioner would contend that the revised tender as\n\nper Ext.P-21 is practically similar to the earlier tender as per Ext.P-1\n\ndated 2.10.2015, except for the modification in the quantities/value\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C).13058/16                        -: 4 :-</span>\n\nand addition and deletion of certain items and that this is all the\n\nmore evident from Ext.P-22 comparative statement of original\n\ntender and the revised tender. That a provision has already been\n\nmade in Ext.P-1 tender notification as per clause 35 thereof for\n\nvariation and deviation. That price of all additional items/non-\n\ntendered items will be worked out on the basis of the rates quoted\n\nfor similar items in the contract whenever existing or on\n\nengineering rate analysis based on the prevalent fair price of labour,\n\nmaterials and other components as required and further crucially\n\nthat &quot;the tender rates shall hold good for any increase or decrease in the tendered quantities\n\nupto a variation of 25%&quot; and that the rate for the respective items may be\n\nreviewed on mutually agreed terms, etc. That this aspect was clearly\n\nand cogently reiterated by the 1st respondent while responding to\n\nthe petitioner&#x27;s pre-bid queries as per Ext.P-4, to which Ext.P-5\n\nreply was given by the 1st respondent, more particularly item Nos.34\n\nand 35 thereof, that &quot;All the quantities in the BOQ are tentative which may vary plus or\n\nminus for which the payment is made on actual measurements&quot; and that &quot;the rates are based on\n\nDSR (Delhi Schedule of Rates) 2014 with cost index 46.67% for Trivandrum&quot; and further\n\nin item 42 of Ext.P-5 it was again reiterated by the 1st respondent\n\nthat the whole scope of the work is envisaged to the successful\n\ntenderer and the successful contractor is bound to execute up to a\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P.(C).13058/16                     -: 5 :-</span>\n\nvariation of 25% and the tender rates shall hold good for any\n\nincrease or decrease in the tendered quantities upto variation of\n\n25% and the rate for the respective items will be DSR rates with the\n\nquoted tender below or above, and if any market rate items come\n\nup for execution there will not be any tender excess, etc. It is\n\ncontended by the petitioner that there is no valid justification for\n\ncancellation of Ext.P-1 tender and invitation of Ext.P-21 fresh\n\ntender in its place for the very same work, except on minor cosmetic\n\nchanges, on the same terms and conditions and that there was no\n\nlegal justification for the 2nd respondent for re-tender the work,\n\nwhen the subsequent changes they wanted could have been\n\nprovided in the scope of the work of the successful bidder, in terms\n\nof the aforequoted provisions contained in Ext.P-1 and as assured\n\nin Ext.P-5 reply to pre-bid queries. The petitioner would also\n\ncontend that the impugned cancellation of the tender is vitiated by\n\narbitrariness and unreasonableness and by taking into account\n\nirrelevant and extraneous consideration and by not reckoning into\n\naccount vital and crucial relevant aspects.                In the light of these\n\naspects, the petitioner has the filed the instant Writ Petition (Civil)\n\nwith the following prayers:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &#x27;i.

The 1st respondent KSIDC has resisted the pleas of the\n\npetitioner by filing a counter affidavit dated 20.5.2016. Therein it is\n\ncontended that by merely submitting tenders, only offers are made\n\nby the bidders and until and unless tender bid/offer is accepted by\n\nthe competent authority by issuing letter of acceptance/letter of\n\nintent, the bidders do not acquire any right at all in respect of the\n\nwork and that the 2nd respondent has not accepted any tender and\n\nthat the petitioner cannot seek to compel the 2nd respondent to\n\nenter into a contract for construction of the building and allied\n\nworks with the petitioner. That the petition is not maintainable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Art.226</a> of the Constitution of India. Further it is stated that\n\npursuant to Ext.P-1 e-tender, 7 bids were submitted, out of which\n\n6 had pre-qualified after the technical evaluation of the bids and the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 7 :-</span>\n\nfinancial bids of the pre-qualified bidders were also opened and\n\nwere published in the e-tender website. Further it is averred in para\n\n6 thereof that bill of quantities (BOQ) mentioned in the tender form\n\nwas based on the design and drawing of the architects and of the\n\nsoil investigation survey conducted by a technical institution, viz.,\n\nM/s.LBS Centre for Science &amp; Technology and that according to\n\nM/s.LBS centre, pile foundation was to be fixed at 50 metres on\n\nhard rock and the quantities for rates for piling was estimated on\n\nthe basis of pile length of 50 metres. The IIT Madras was also\n\nconsulted regarding the piling and structural design of the building\n\nand according to them, the depth of the pile required for the\n\nbuilding was to be only 35 metres and substantial difference in the\n\ndepth of the piles between 50 and 35 metres and the estimate of\n\nthe buildings was referred to M/s.KITCO, which is an institute with\n\ntechnical expertise in building construction. That M/s.KITCO after\n\ndetailed examination of the whole aspects, advised that the required\n\ndepth of the piles for the building to be 35 metres instead of 50\n\nmetres and thereafter meetings were convened with M/s.KITCO and\n\nthe architects and it was decided to revise the estimate according to\n\nthe advice of M/s.KITCO. That it was decided to rework the estimate\n\nbased on the comments pointed out by M/s.KITCO and substantial\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 8 :-</span>\n\nalternations were made in the design of the piles and reduction in\n\nthe bill of quantities as well as in the rates and due to changes in\n\nquantities and rates, the cost estimate had to be reduced to\n\nRs.1,21,49,20,821/-from         the      original   estimate      of\n\nRs.1,29,67,13,495/- and out of the differential amount of\n\nRs.8,17,92,674/-,    the amount due        to change    of BOQ    is\n\nRs.7,05,24,170/- and the amount attributable to change in rates is\n\nRs.1,12,68,504/-. It is further stated in para 7 thereof that the 2nd\n\nrespondent being a Government company, any capital expenditure\n\nexceeding Rs.35 crores must be reserved for the decision of the\n\nGovernor and, only according to the decision of the Governor, the\n\nexpenditure for any works as in this case can be made and the said\n\nrequirement is made as per the Articles of Association of the 2nd\n\nrespondent      company,   which    provide   the  said   mandatory\n\nrequirement. That, in accordance with the said mandatory norm, a\n\nProject     Implementation Committee (PIC) has been constituted by\n\nthe Government with the Principal Secretary (Industries) as\n\nChairman, the Managing Director of the 2nd respondent Corporation\n\nand other officers and the proceedings relating to the tender of the\n\nabove work and all records were placed before the PIC for approval\n\nand the PIC at its meeting held on 1.3.2016 had considered the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 9 :-</span>\n\nentire matter and found that the structural design of Innovation cum\n\nIncubation Centre, was submitted to IIT, Madras at the time when\n\nthe tender proceedings were initiated. It was noted by the PIC that\n\nthe cost estimate of the building excluding mechanical, electrical\n\nand plumbing as estimated by the architect would work out to\n\nRs.129.67 crores and the work was tendered through e-tender\n\nportal on 2.10.2015 and the financial bids of the 6 pre-qualified\n\nbidders, were opened on 4.12.2015. That in the meanwhile IIT,\n\nMadras,      had submitted vetted    structural  design containing\n\nsubstantial difference in the measurements and quantity estimate as\n\nagainst the BOQ published vide the tender documents. It was noted\n\nthat the BOQ and cost estimate were reviewed by M/s.KITCO and it\n\nwas found that the cost estimate was on the higher side as stated\n\npreviously and required to be revised, whereby the cost estimate\n\nwas reworked at Rs.121.49 crores in the place of the original\n\nestimate of Rs.129.67 crores and the total reduction in estimate is\n\nRs.8.18 crores and based on the deliberations and considering all\n\nrelevant aspects, the PIC observed that in the given situation the\n\nright step to be taken is to cancel Ext.P-1 tender and initiate\n\ntendering procedure afresh on reasons of procedural compliance\n\nand transparency and it was therefore decided to cancel the earlier\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 10 :-</span>\n\ntender and re-tender the work with a probable amount of contract\n\n(PAC) for Rs.121.49 crores by providing ample publicity through\n\nnational level dailies and local vernacular dailies, etc. The true copy\n\nof the minutes of the proceedings of the PIC held on 1.3.2016 has\n\nbeen produced as Ext.R-4(a) along with the said counter affidavit. It\n\nis thus pointed out that the impugned Ext.P-18 proceedings dated\n\n2.3.2016 were issued on the basis of the decision taken by the PIC\n\nas reflected in Ext.R-4(a) and that consequently, the impugned\n\nExt.P-21 re-tender notification dated 4.3.2016 was issued. It is\n\nfurther stated in para 13 thereof that since there was large\n\nreductions in quantities in several items and increase in quantities\n\nof other items and changes in rates of several items of work, fresh\n\ntender was to be made, whereby equal opportunity will be offered to\n\nall the eligible bidders including the petitioner, subject to their\n\neligibility conditions and that it is improper and unfair to award the\n\nwork to the petitioner without inviting fresh tenders, etc. Further it\n\nis contended in para 17 that the petitioner, after having downloaded\n\nthe revised tender and made pre-bid queries by Exts.P-23 and\n\nP-24, is estopped from challenging the impugned Ext.P-21\n\nre-tender proceedings. Further that the stand of the petitioner to\n\ndirect the 2nd respondent to consider the offer of the petitioner to\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">W.P.(C).13058/16                 -: 11 :-</span>\n\nexecute the work with proposed variations and reduced value at the\n\nsame bid percentage offered by them and to issue the necessary\n\nwork order in their favour will be most unfair and impermissible,\n\netc. Various other submissions and contentions are raised in the\n\ncounter affidavit in respect of the various other averments and\n\ncontentions raised in the Writ Petition.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">       4.     The petitioner has filed a reply affidavit dated 20.6.2016,\n\nto meet the case put forward in the abovesaid counter affidavit\n\ndated 20.5.2016. As against the specific case put forth by the 2nd\n\nrespondent in paras 6 &amp; 7 of their counter affidavit regarding the\n\nrevision of depth of piles from the original 50 metres to 35 metres\n\nand other related aspects, the petitioner has given specific\n\naverments and contentions in paras 9 to 11 of their reply affidavit\n\ndated 20.6.2016. Therein it is specifically contended by the\n\npetitioner that the BOQ originally provided to the bidders along with\n\nthe tender documents contained various discrepancies with regard\n\nto the piling work, which were brought to the notice of the 2nd\n\nrespondent by the petitioner in Ext.P-4 pre-bid queries submitted\n\nby the petitioner to the respondents in 14.10.2015, more\n\nparticularly to query      Nos.5, 9, 11 and 16, for which the 2nd\n\nrespondent had given Ext.P-5 reply, more particularly in items 34 to\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 12 :-</span>\n\n38 thereof, which has been quoted earlier herein above and also\n\nstating therein that the drawings uploaded are tentative drawings\n\nfor the purpose of quoting rates and that goods for construction\n\ndrawings will be supplied at the site during the course of the\n\nconstruction and all the works and the measurements for billing will\n\nbe based on the good for construction drawings, etc. and that all\n\nthe quantities in the BOQ are tentative, which may vary plus or\n\nminus, for which the payment is made on actual measurements and\n\nthat the rate quoted is for the whole work, etc.         Further it is\n\nspecifically contended therein that the justification now made by the\n\n2nd respondent to recall the earlier tender and issue revised tender\n\non the pretext that substantial alterations are made in the design in\n\nthe piles, is totally wrong and, to demonstrate this, the petitioner\n\nhas submitted Ext.P-27 comparison chart and has pointed out that\n\nthe piling quantity comparison arrived at on the basis of the number\n\nand length of piles indicated in the drawing would clearly establish\n\nthat the number of piles, length of piles and piling quantity as per\n\nthe drawing remain the same in the original tender as well as in the\n\nrevised tender and that it is only the piling quantity as per the BOQ,\n\nwhich has been corrected in the revised tender so as to match the\n\npiling quantity arrived at as per the number and length of piles.\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">W.P.(C).13058/16                 -: 13 :-</span>\n\nThat despite the discrepancies in the BOQ pointed out by none other\n\nthan the petitioner in the pre-bid queries, the 2nd respondent has\n\nclearly taken the stand the said BOQ quantities were tentative and\n\nthat payment shall be made on actual measurements based good\n\nfor construction drawing and that the rate quoted (percentage rate)\n\nis for the whole work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">       5.     In tune with the contention based on the aforementioned\n\nclause 35 of Ext.P-1 tender notice regarding the permissibility of\n\nvariations upto 25%, it has been further contended in para 12 of the\n\nreply affidavit that as the original tender makes it obligatory on the\n\npart of successful bidder to execute the work for any increase or\n\ndecrease in the tendered quantities up to variation of 25% and also\n\ncontemplated a mechanism of review of rates on mutually agreed\n\nterms for variation in the tendered quantities beyond 25% , it was\n\nwrong on the part of the 2nd respondent in cancelling the tender bid\n\nand go in for a fresh tender, which has the effect of burdening the\n\nCorporation with additional expenditure as well as delaying the\n\ncompletion, etc. As regards the decision in Ext.R-4(a), it is pointed\n\nout in para 14 of the reply affidavit that the said stand is arbitrary to\n\nthe earlier consistent stand taken by the 2nd respondent in going\n\nahead with the issue of original tender in spite of the reference\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 14 :-</span>\n\nregarding structural design, BOQ and cost remittance for the vetting\n\nof the IIT Madras, etc. It is also pointed out in paras 14 and 15 of\n\nthe reply affidavit that the comparative statement as per Ext.P-27\n\nclearly shows that there was neither any change in the number and\n\nlength of the piles as per the drawing nor there was any change in\n\nthe piling quantity as per the drawing between the original tender\n\nand the revised tender and the only discrepancy was in the piling\n\nquantity as per the BOQ of the original tender, which was already\n\npointed out by the petitioner in the pre-bid queries, to which the\n\naforementioned clear response and clarifications were given by the\n\n2nd respondent as per Ext.P-5. It is also contended in para 20\n\nthereof that the difference in the cost estimate as between the\n\noriginal estimate and the revised estimate is reduction to the tune of\n\nRs.8.18 crores, which is hardly -6.31% of the original estimated\n\ncontract value and that when the original tender as per as Clause 35\n\nitself mandates that a +/- 25% variation in the tendered quantities\n\nalong with mechanism of review of the rates, etc. it was improper\n\nand unreasonable to have cancelled the original bid, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">       6.

The\n\npetitioner thereafter, filed an additional reply affidavit dated\n\n20.9.2016, pointing out certain aspects regarding the various\n\nextensions granted to the revised tender bid and also producing\n\ntherewith a copy of the the revised tender summary report dated\n\n23.5.2016 as Ext.P-29. The 2nd respondent has thereafter filed a\n\nsupplementary counter affidavit dated 4.10.2016 giving certain\n\ndetails regarding the submissions made by the petitioner in respect\n\nof the revised tender bid and also producing therewith a copy of the\n\ncorrigendum dated 25.4.2016 in respect of the revised tender as\n\nExt.R-4(k). The 2nd respondent has also filed an additional affidavit\n\ndated 19.10.2016 producing therewith Exts.R-4(l) to R-4(r), which\n\nare copies of the communications between the 2nd respondent with\n\nthe IIT Madras, M/s.KITCO, etc. The petitioner has also filed\n\nsupplementary affidavit dated 24.10.2016.\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 16 :-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">       7.

There is an obvious difference in the contracts between\n       private parties and contracts to which the State is a party. Private\n       parties are concerned only with their personal interest whereas the\n       State while exercising its powers and discharging its functions, acts\n       indubitably, as is expected of it, for public good and in public\n       interest. The impact of every State action is also on public interest.\n       This factor alone is sufficient to import at least the minimal\n       requirements of public law obligations and impress with this\n       character the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It is a\n       different matter that the scope of judicial review in respect of\n       disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be\n       more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to\n       adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">W.P.(C).13058/16                      -: 20 :-</span>\n\n       adjudication of purely contractual disputes. However, to the extent,\n       challenge is made on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 14</a> by alleging\n       that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact\n       that the dispute also falls within the domain of contractual\n       obligations would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply\n       with the basic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14.</a> To this extent, the\n       obligation is of a public character invariably in every case irrespective\n       of there being any other right or obligation in addition thereto. An\n       additional contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the\n       guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 14</a> of non-arbitrariness at the hands of the\n       State in any of its actions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">              23.    Thus, in a case like the present, if it is shown that the\n       impugned State action is arbitrary and, therefore, violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Article\n       14</a> of the Constitution, there can be no impediment in striking down\n       the impugned act irrespective of the question whether an additional\n       right, contractual or statutory, if any, is also available to the\n       aggrieved persons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              24.    The State cannot be attributed the split personality of\n       Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the contractual field so as to impress on it\n       all the characteristics of the State at the threshold while making a\n       contract requiring it to fulfil the obligation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 14</a> of the\n       Constitution and thereafter permitting it to cast off its garb of State\n       to adorn the new robe of a private body during the subsistence of the\n       contract enabling it to act arbitrarily subject only to the contractual\n       obligations and remedies flowing from it. It is really the nature of its\n       personality as State which is significant and must characterize all its\n       actions, in whatever field, and not the nature of function, contractual\n       or otherwise, which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted for\n       examining the validity of its act. The requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> being\n       the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably, there is nothing which\n       militates against the concept of requiring the State always to so act,\n       even in contractual matters. There is a basic difference between the\n       acts of the State which must invariably be in pubic interest and those\n       of a private individual, engaged in similar activities, being primarily\n       for personal gain, which may or may not promote public interest.\n       Viewed in this manner, in which we find no conceptual difficulty or\n       anachronism, we find no reason why the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 14</a>\n       should not extend even in the sphere of contractual matters for\n       regulating the conduct of the State activity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                             xxx           xxx           xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">              27.    Unlike a private party whose acts uninformed by reason\n       and influenced by personal predilections in contractual matters may\n       result in adverse consequences to it alone without affecting the\n       public interest, any such act of the State or a public body even in this\n       field would adversely affect the public interest. Every holder of a\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">W.P.(C).13058/16                        -: 21 :-</span>\n\n       public office by virtue of which he acts on behalf of the State or\n       public body is ultimately accountable to the people in whom the\n       sovereignty vests. As such, all powers so vested in him are meant to\n       be exercised for public good and promoting the public interest. This\n       is equally true of all actions even in the field of contract. Thus, every\n       holder of a public office is a trustee whose highest duty is to the\n       people of the country and, therefore, every act of the holder of a\n       public office, irrespective of the label classifying that act, is in\n       discharge of public duty meant ultimately for public good. With the\n       diversification of State activity in a Welfare State requiring the State to\n       discharge its wide ranging functions even through its several\n       instrumentalities, which requires entering into contracts also, it\n       would be unreal and not pragmatic, apart from being unjustified to\n       exclude contractual matters from the sphere of State actions required\n       to be non-arbitrary and justified on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 14.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">              28.     Even assuming that it is necessary to import the\n       concept of presence of some public element in a State action to\n       attract <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 14</a> and permit judicial review, we have no hesitation in\n       saying that the ultimate impact of all actions of the State or a public\n       body being undoubtedly on public interest, the requisite public\n       element for this purpose is present also in contractual matters. We,\n       therefore, find it difficult and unrealistic to exclude the State actions\n       in contractual matters, after the contract has been made, from the\n       purview of judicial review to test its validity on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 14.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"186428\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1281050\" id=\"span_27\">29.

In the facts\n\nof that case, in the State of Uttaranchal, there were 6 State\n\ncontrolled sugar mills, which produce molasses and the sale of\n\nmolasses was regulated by Molasses Sale Committee constituted by\n\nthe State Government. On the basis of the tender received, the\n\ncommittee permitted the respondent therein to lift 85000 quintals\n\nof molasses from the mills at a particular price and the Government\n\nreceived a report that the price was much higher and so the\n\nSecretary, Cane Department &amp; Sugar Industries, had stayed the said\n\norder of the committee. In the Writ Petition, the High Court had\n\ntaken the view that there was a concluded contract and having\n\nregard to doctrines of part performance, legitimate expectation,\n\nestoppel and acquiescence, the impugned cancellation of the\n\nallotment was held to be unsustainable and illegal.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">       12.    The Apex Court has held in paras 23 and 24 thereof that\n\nwhen a Writ Petition was filed with regard to the said contractual\n\nissues, the issue to be considered was as to whether the\n\nGovernment had acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in staying the\n\noperation of the allotment letter or in subsequently cancelling the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">W.P.(C).13058/16                        -: 23 :-</span>\n\nallotment, whereas in the private law remedy of civil suit, the whole\n\nemphasis is on contractual right. But in public law remedy of judicial\n\nreview focus shifts with the exercise of power by the State authority,\n\nthat whether the impugned cancellation order passed by the\n\nGovernment was arbitrary or unreasonable and in such context of\n\npublic law remedy, the issue whether there was a concluded\n\ncontract and breach thereof, becomes secondary, etc. But while\n\ndealing with that situation the Apex Court had held in (2008) 12\n\nSCC 500, p.p.512-513, paras 23 &amp; 24 as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               &quot;23. If the dispute was considered as purely one relating to\n       existence of an agreement, that is, whether there was a concluded\n       contract and whether the cancellation and consequential non-supply\n       amounted to breach of such contract, the first respondent ought to\n       have approached the civil court for damages. On the other hand,\n       when a writ petition was filed in regard to the said contractual\n       dispute, the issue was whether the Secretary (Sugar), had acted\n       arbitrarily or unreasonably in staying the operation of the allotment\n       letter dated 26-3-2004 or subsequently cancelling the allotment\n       letter. In a civil suit, the emphasis is on the contractual right. In a writ\n       petition, the focus shifts to the exercise of power by the authority,\n       that is, whether the order of cancellation dated 24-4-2004 passed by\n       the Secretary (Sugar), was arbitrary or unreasonable. The issue\n       whether there was a concluded contract and breach thereof becomes\n       secondary. In exercising writ jurisdiction, if the High Court found that\n       the exercise of power in passing an order of cancellation was not\n       arbitrary and unreasonable, it should normally desist from giving any\n       finding on disputed or complicated questions of fact as to whether\n       there was a contract, and relegate the petitioner to the remedy of a\n       civil suit. Even in cases where the High Court finds that there is a\n       valid contract, if the impugned administrative action by which the\n       contract is cancelled, is not unreasonable or arbitrary, it should still\n       refuse to interfere with the same, leaving the aggrieved party to work\n       out his remedies in a civil court. In other words, when there is a\n       contractual dispute with a public law element, and a party chooses\n       the public law remedy by way of a writ petition instead of a private\n       law remedy of a suit, he will not get a full-fledged adjudication of his\n       contractual rights, but only a judicial review of the administrative\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">W.P.(C).13058/16                        -: 24 :-</span>\n\n       action. The question whether there was a contract and whether there\n       was a breach may, however, be examined incidentally while\n       considering the reasonableness of the administrative action. But\n       where the question whether there was a contract, is seriously\n       disputed, the High Court cannot assume that there was a valid\n       contract and on that basis, examine the validity of the administrative\n       action.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">               24. In this case, the question that arose for consideration in\n       the writ petition was whether the order dated 24-4-2004 passed by\n       the Secretary (Sugar), cancelling the allotment letter dated 26-3-\n       2004 was arbitrary and irrational or violative of any administrative\n       law principles. The question whether there was a concluded contract\n       or not, was only incidental to the question as to whether cancellation\n       order dated 24-4-2004 by the Secretary (Sugar), was justified. As the\n       case involved several disputed questions in regard to the existence of\n       the contract itself, the High Court ought to have referred the first\n       respondent to a civil court. But the High Court in exercise of its writ\n       jurisdiction, proceeded as if it was dealing with a pure and simple\n       civil suit relating to breach of contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">       13.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"187501619\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/187501619/\" id=\"a_36\">Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd. v.

Committed an error of law,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       3. committed a breach of the rules of natural justice,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       4. reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal would have\n       reached or,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       5. abused its powers.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">       Therefore, it is not for the court to determine whether a particular\n       policy or particular decision taken in the fulfilment of that policy is\n       fair. It is only concerned with the manner in which those decisions\n       have been taken. The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from\n       case to case. Shortly put, the grounds upon which an administrative\n       action is subject to control by judicial review can be classified as\n       under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">               (i) Illegality : This means the decision-maker must understand\n       correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must\n       give effect to it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">               (ii) Irrationality, namely, Wednesbury unreasonableness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">               (iii) Procedural impropriety.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"861688\" id=\"span_43\">The above are only the broad grounds but it does not rule out\n       addition of further grounds in course of time. As a matter of fact, in\n       <a href=\"/doc/861688/\" id=\"a_45\">R. v. Secretary of State</a> for the Home Department, ex Brind, Lord\n       Diplock [(1991) 1 AC 694] refers specifically to one development,\n       namely, the possible recognition of the principle of proportionality.\n       In all these cases the test to be adopted is that the court should,\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">W.P.(C).13058/16                            -: 28 :-</span>\n\n       &quot;consider whether something has gone wrong of a nature and degree which\n       requires its intervention&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">                                xxx              xxx              xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">       81. Two other facets of irrationality may be mentioned.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">              (1) It is open to the court to review the decision-maker&#x27;s\n       evaluation of the facts. The court will intervene where the facts taken\n       as a whole could not logically warrant the conclusion of the\n       decision-maker. If the weight of facts pointing to one course of\n       action is overwhelming, then a decision the other way, cannot be\n       upheld. Thus, in Emma Hotels Ltd. v. Secretary of State for\n       Environment [(1980) 41 P&amp;CR 255], the Secretary of State referred to\n       a number of factors which led him to the conclusion that a non-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">       resident&#x27;s bar in a hotel was operated in such a way that the bar was\n       not an incident of the hotel use for planning purposes, but\n       constituted a separate use. The Divisional Court analysed the factors\n       which led the Secretary of State to that conclusion and, having done\n       so, set it aside. Donaldson, L.J. said that he could not see on what\n       basis the Secretary of State had reached his conclusion.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">              (2) A decision would be regarded as unreasonable if it is\n       impartial and unequal in its operation as between different classes.\n       On this basis in R. v.

However, while entertaining an objection as to the\n       maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n       India, the court should bear in mind the fact that the power to issue\n       prerogative writs under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is plenary in\n       nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the Constitution. The\n       High Court having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to\n       entertain or not to entertain a writ petition.

It is relevant to note the opinion of the learned author\n\nH.W.R. Wade: Administrative Law (10th Edn.) page 297 as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">               &quot;... The whole conception         of unfettered discretion is\n       inappropriate to a public authority, which possesses powers solely in\n       order that it may use them for the public good.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">               There is nothing paradoxical in the imposition of such legal\n       limits. It would indeed be paradoxical if they were not imposed. Nor\n       is it a special restriction which fetters only local authorities: it applies\n       no less to ministers of the Crown. Nor is it confined to the sphere of\n       administration: it operates wherever discretion is given for some\n       public purpose, for example where a judge has a discretion to order\n       jury trial. It is only where powers are given for the personal benefit of\n       the person empowered that the discretion is absolute. Plainly this can\n       have no application in public law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">               For the same reasons there should in principle be no such\n       thing as unreviewable administrative discretion, which should be just\n       as much a contradiction in terms as unfettered discretion. The\n       question which has to be asked is what is the scope of judicial review,\n       and in a few special cases the scope for the review of discretionary\n       decisions may be minimal. It remains axiomatic that all discretion is\n       capable of abuse, and that legal limits to every power are to be found\n       somewhere.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">       21.     One of the main contentions urged by the learned Senior\n\nCounsel appearing for the writ petitioner is that the 2nd respondent\n\nhad issued Ext.P-1 original tender only after due verification of the\n\nrequirements of the quantities and value of the project and as such,\n\ntheir sudden decision to cancel the tender as per Ext.P-18 and issue\n\na fresh tender as per Ext.P-21 for the same work on the same terms\n\nand conditions with only cosmetic and minor changes in the\n\nquantities and value, would fall very well within the scope and ambit\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 36 :-</span>\n\nof the permitted variation as envisaged in clause 35 of the Ext.P-1\n\nand that therefore the impugned cancellation of the tender is per se\n\nunreasonable, unfair and unjust and is in violation of Clause 35,\n\nwhich deals with the permissible variation upto plus or minus 25%\n\nand that the impugned proceedings are unreasonable, improper and\n\nillegal. That inasmuch as there is no substantial variation between\n\nExt.P-21 revised tender and Ext.P-1 original tender, the 2nd\n\nrespondent has egregiously erred in cancelling the earlier tender,\n\nwhich are not for relevant and lawful consideration permitted by the\n\nterms and conditions of the tender in Ext.P-1 and therefore are only\n\nfor extraneous and irrelevant considerations which are not germane\n\nfor the matter and that hence the impugned cancellation of the\n\ntender bid and the consequent revised tender proceedings are\n\nvitiated and are liable to be quashed by this Court. So also, the\n\npetitioner would place heavy reliance on the clear and categoric\n\nstand taken by the 2nd respondent in Ext.P-5 reply to the pre-bid\n\nqueries. The petitioner would also point out that they had raised\n\nmany pre-bid queries as per Ext.P-4 submitted as early as on\n\n14.10.2015, more particularly as per items 9, 16, etc. thereof,\n\nregarding the discrepancy in the length of the piles, as given in\n\nschedule of the piles in the notes below the drawing and that, to\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 37 :-</span>\n\nthis, the 2nd respondent had taken the considered and clear stand in\n\nExt.P-5, more particularly in items 34 to 38, 42, etc. thereof, clearly\n\nand categorically pointing out therein that all quantities in the BOQs\n\nare tentative and this may vary plus or minus for which payments\n\nhave to be made only on the basis of actual measurements and that\n\nthe rate is for the whole work and further that the successful\n\ncontractor is bound to execute upto a variation of 25% and the\n\ntender rates shall hold good for any increase or decrease upto 25%\n\nvariation, etc. and that therefore the competent officials of the 2nd\n\nrespondent themselves were convinced about the applicability of\n\nClause 35 of Ext.P-1, which permitted variation upto plus or minus\n\n25% and that the volte-face shown in the impugned Ext.P-18 which\n\nis issued long after admitting the petitioner&#x27;s bid as lowest tender\n\n(L1) as per Exts.P-14 and Ext.P-15, is nothing but highly arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable, improper and legally wrong. Variation in value of the\n\nrevised tender bid and the original bid, which comes to -Rs.8.18\n\ncrores, which is hardly -6.31% and that it is within the permissible\n\nlimit of variation etc. Various contentions have been urged by both\n\nsides based on the pleadings and materials on record. In order to\n\nhave a proper determination of the matter posed in this matter, it is\n\nnecessary to make an appreciation of the various relevant factual\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">W.P.(C).13058/16                  -: 38 :-</span>\n\naspects in its sequence.          As directed by this Court, the 2nd\n\nrespondent has also made available the entire files relating to the\n\noriginal bid as well as the files relating to the revised tender bid.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       22.    That the file in relation to the original tender bid and its\n\ncancellation, will be referred hereinafter as &quot;the main file&quot; and the\n\nfiles in relation to the re-tender will be referred for convenience as\n\n&quot;the re-tender file&quot;. It can be seen from the extract of the minutes\n\nof the 293rd meeting of the Board of Directors of the 2nd respondent\n\nKSIDC held on 2.3.2015 that decision was taken for the KSIDC to\n\nproceed with the preparation of the detailed structural design, BOQ\n\netc. of the buildings through the architects based on the floor plan\n\nfinalised so as to avoid delays (which can be seen from pages 18\n\nand 19 of the main file). Thereafter, it appears that technical\n\nconsultant/ architects had submitted the design and the details for\n\nthe tender bid, as can be seen from pages 20 to 37 of the main file.\n\nBy Ext.R-4(l) dated 13.6.2015, the 2nd respondent had requested the\n\nIndian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, to take up the vetting of\n\nthe structural design for the proposed construction and to this, the\n\ntechnical expert at IIT, had responded on 14.6.2015 the readiness\n\nof the IIT to take up the work of proof checking of the structural\n\ndesign and had requested for the architectural drawings. This is also\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 39 :-</span>\n\nreferred to in Ext.R-4(l). Later by Ext.R-4(m) dated 17.6.2015 the\n\n2nd respondent had forwarded the formal letter to the IIT authorities\n\nto take up the abovesaid work of proof checking and the\n\narchitectural drawings are also enclosed therewith. By Ext.R-4(n)\n\ndated 28.9.2015, the IIT authorities had forwarded the capacity\n\ncalculations to the 2nd respondent and their consultant. Ext.R-(n)\n\ndated 28.9.2015 piling capacity calculations submitted by the IIT,\n\nand received by the 2nd respondent KSIDC on 28.9.2015, are\n\nenclosed in pages 69 to 81 of the main file. Thereafter, on\n\n29.9.2015, the competent authority of the 2nd respondent [viz.\n\nTechnical Adviser (Civil)] had observed in his remarks dated\n\n29.9.2015 that he has generally verified the detailed estimate of the\n\nabovesaid work prepared by the consultant, which is prepared on\n\nthe basis of the tentative design which is to be finalised shortly by\n\nthe IIT and further that the quantities provided for each item are\n\nlikely to be increased or decreased when the structural design is\n\nfinalised. That however the estimate prepared based on the\n\ntentative design can be considered for going ahead with the tender\n\ncall, if approved, that according to him, the provisions/items are\n\nadequate for satisfactory completion of the building intended for\n\nspecial purpose. The said remarks of the Technical Adviser (Civil)\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">W.P.(C).13058/16                      -: 40 :-</span>\n\nare enclosed in page 38 of the main file, which read as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                       &quot;Remarks by Technical Adviser (Civil)\n\n              Sub:-CONSTRUCTION OF INNOVATION CUM INCUBATION\n       TOWER AND ALLIED WORKS IN LIFE SCIENCES PARK, THONNAKKAL,\n       THIRUVANANTHAPURAM.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">       I have generally verified the detailed estimate of the above work\n       prepared by Mr.S.B.Asokan, Consultant.

The consultant/architect had also submitted letter dated\n\n1.10.2015 appending therewith the estimate for the above\n\nconstruction amounting to Rs.1.30 crores stating therein that the\n\nestimate prepared is based on the DSR (Delhi Schedule of Rate),\n\n2014, by incorporating cost index of 46.67% for Trivandrum and the\n\ndetailed estimate, observed data for market rate items and the\n\nabstract of the estimate are appended therewith and that soft copies\n\nfor uploading e-tender have already been forwarded through mail\n\nand the same has been uploaded to the e-portal tender on\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">W.P.(C).13058/16                    -: 41 :-</span>\n\n1.10.2015 itself, etc. The said letter dated 1.10.2015 (at page 82 of\n\nthe main file) submitted by the consultant/architect to the KSIDC on\n\n1.10.2015 along with the detailed estimate BOQ, etc. reads as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">              &quot;Sub:- Regarding Construction of Innovation Cum Incubation\n       Tower and Allied Works of KSIDC&#x27;s proposed Life Science Park at\n       Thonnakkal, Trivandrum - Submission of Estimate, BOQ and Tender\n       document.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">       Ref:-1, Architectural agreement dated 03.12.2014.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">       Dear Sir,\n\n       Iamounting\n         am herewith submitting the estimate for the above building\n                   to Rs.130 Crores.

Thus it can be seen from\n\na perusal of the letter of the Technical Adviser (Civil) of the 2nd\n\nrespondent dated 29.9.2015, (page 38 of the main file) as well as\n\nthe architectural floor plans and drawings submitted by the\n\nconsultant given on pages 22 to 34 of the file and the abstract\n\nestimate and letter of the consultant given on 1.10.2015 (see pages\n\n39 to 68 &amp; 82 of the main file) that the 2nd respondent had\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 42 :-</span>\n\nconsciously decided to proceed with the tender bid from 29.9.2015,\n\neven though Ext.R-4(n) e-mail communication was received from\n\nthe IIT authorities on 28.9.2015 at 10.19 a.m. along with the pile\n\ncapacity calculations of IIT (See pages 69 to 81 of the main file) and\n\nthis led to publication of     Ext.P-1 e-tender on 2.10.2015. It is\n\nthereafter that the petitioner had submitted Ext.P-4 detailed pre-\n\nbid queries on 14.10.2015 raising several queries and clarifications\n\nespecially regarding the discrepancies and mismatch between the\n\nBOQ shown in the tender documents vis-a-vis the actual drawings\n\nfurnished by the respondents, etc.          Thereafter, after pre-bid\n\nmeeting, Ext.P-5 dated 16.10.2015 was issued to the petitioner\n\ngiving the requisite clarifications and also assuring about the\n\nmatters, which are specifically referred to therein that all quantities\n\nare tentative and the payments will be made on actual\n\nmeasurements and goods for construction drawings will be supplied\n\nduring the course of the construction and that the whole scope of\n\nthe work is envisaged to the successful tenderer, who is bound to\n\nexecute upto variation of 25% and that the tender rates shall hold\n\ngood for any increase and decrease in the tendered quantities up to\n\nvariation of 25%, etc. It is thereafter, that on 26.10.2015 (the first\n\nextension of the last date of submission of the tender was given -\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 43 :-</span>\n\nsee page 125 of the main file) whereby the initial last date\n\n29.10.2015 was extended upto 7.11.2015. It is also pointed out by\n\nthe petitioner that on 27.10.2105, the 2nd respondent had uploaded\n\nthe second set of drawings for the bidders to follow, replacing the\n\none earlier issued, presumably due to the pre-bid queries.\n\nThereafter, Ext.P-6 is issued on 8.11.2015 finally extending the last\n\ndate of submission of the tender bids upto 21.11.2015 and Ext.P-5\n\ncorrigendum was issued on 9.11.2015 issuing certain additions for\n\nsome quantities like vitrified tiles and certain other items mentioned\n\ntherein. Later on 10.11.2015, as per Ext.R-4(o) the IIT had\n\nforwarded its comments to the 2nd respondent. It is relevant to note\n\nthat as stated earlier, the 2nd respondent had obtained the piling\n\ncalculations from the IIT well before Ext.P-1 tender was published\n\non 2.10.2015. It is thereafter, that the petitioner had submitted\n\nExt.P-8 tender bid on 20.11.2015, which          is within the second\n\nextended time limit of 21.11.2025. The 2nd respondent had opened\n\nthe technical bids on 26.11.2015 as per Exts.P-8 to P-10. The hard\n\ncopy of the pre-qualification/technical bid was also submitted by\n\nthe petitioner as per Ext.P-11 on 21.11.2015. Thereafter the 2nd\n\nrespondent had opened the technical bids as per Ext.P-12 on\n\n26.11.2015 and found 6 out of the 7 bidders as qualified. On\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 44 :-</span>\n\n26.11.2025, as can be seen from Ext.R-4(p), the 2nd respondent had\n\nforwarded the cost estimate, architectural drawings and other\n\nrelevant drawings to M/s.KITCO seeking their inputs.        To this,\n\nM/s.KITCO had forwarded their inputs as per Ext.R-4(p). On\n\n4.12.2015, the 2nd had opened the financial bid as per Ext.P-14 and\n\nthe petitioner was admitted as the lower tenderer on 4.12.2015\n\nitself, as can be seen from Ext.P-15. Thus it is to be borne in mind\n\nthat even pending receipt of the detailed comments from the IIT, the\n\n2nd respondent had consciously decided to give 2 extensions for\n\nsubmission of the tender bids, of which the initial extension was\n\nupto      7.11.2015 and thereafter it was finally extended upto\n\n20.11.2015. Even after receipt of the detailed comments from the\n\nIIT as per Ext.R-4(o) dated 10.11.2015 the 2nd respondent had\n\nfurther proceeded with opening of the technical bids on 26.11.2015\n\nand M/s.KITCO had acknowledged the receipt of the details as can\n\nbe seen from Ext.R-4(p) dated 30.11.2015. Even after the pendency\n\nof the matter with M/s.KITCO as per              Ext.R-4(p), the 2nd\n\nrespondent had also consciously decided to proceed to open the\n\nfinancial bids on 4.12.2015 as can be seen from Exts.P-14 and P-\n\n15, by which the petitioner was admitted as the L1.    As per Ext.R-\n\n4(b)/R-4(q) dated 31.12.2015, M/s.KITCO had given their detailed\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">W.P.(C).13058/16                  -: 45 :-</span>\n\ncomments. In response to Ext.R-4(b)/R-4(q) the 2nd respondent\n\nKSIDC had given their detailed responses along with their letter\n\ndated 27.10.2016 sent to M/s.KITCO as can be seen from pages\n\n177 to 185 of the main file. In response to the comments made by\n\nM/s.KITCO, as per item no.15 of Ext.R-4(q) that the rate of market\n\nrate items for external finishes are on the higher side, etc. it was\n\npointed out by R-2 in their letter dated 27.1.2016 that the KSIDC\n\nhad directly collected quotations from suppliers and that the\n\namount quoted is Rs.19.85 crores as against Rs. 17.83 crores\n\nshown in the tender and the comparative statement giving all those\n\ndetails were appended with that letter sent by the KSIDC and copies\n\nof the quotations received from the suppliers were also sent by\n\ncourier to M/s.KITCO. Page 184 of the main file would show that the\n\nrates shown in the tender was much less than various reliable\n\nquotations collected by KSIDC and these aspects were pointed out\n\nby R-2 in order to respond to some of the apprehensions raised by\n\nM/s.KITCO. All the other details in that regard regarding financial\n\nimplications based on comments of M/s.KITCO are given on pages\n\n177 to 184 of the main file.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">       23.    It is thereafter that M/s.KITCO has sent Ext.R-4(r) dated\n\n17.2.2016 to R-2. As per item 4 of Ext.R-4(r), it is stated by\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 46 :-</span>\n\nM/s.KITCO that it was answered by the architect that many of the\n\nitems mentioned in M/s.KITCO&#x27;s letter would be incorporated while\n\nexecuting the agreement and that the possibility of doing the same\n\nand possible future implications may be confirmed by a\n\nlegal/contract expert by KSIDC in view of the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_80\">Indian Contract Act</a> and CVC guidelines and this is being post\n\ntender changes. A reading of item No.4 of Ext.R-4(r) would disclose\n\nthat some of the comments or queries raised by M/s.KITCO was\n\nanswered by the architect as stated therein. Since the answering of\n\nthe queries is said to be rendered by the architect, the said architect\n\ncan only be the consultant appointed by the KSIDC as per Ext.P-1,\n\nas a reading of page 18 of Ext.P-1 [definitions, terms &amp;\n\ninterpretations given under General Conditions of Contract - see\n\npage 33 of the paper book of W.P.(C)] will reveal that as per Clause\n\n1(3) thereof, &quot;consultant&quot; means the named architect consortium,\n\nwho is mentioned therein or in the event of his/their ceasing to be\n\nconsultant for the purpose of that contract, such other person/s as\n\nKSIDC shall nominate for the purpose. Therefore, architect\n\nmentioned as per item No.4 of Ext.R-4(r) can only be the technical\n\nconsultant, as envisaged in the contract (architect appointed by the\n\nKSIDC) as the reference in item No.4 of Ext.R-4(r) is that the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 47 :-</span>\n\narchitect had answered the queries of M/s.KITCO and therefore such\n\nanswers or responses given to M/s.KITCO could have been only by\n\nthe architect for and on behalf of the KSIDC. Therefore, even\n\nimmediately prior to Ext.R-4(r) dated 17.2.2016, the stand of R-2\n\nKSIDC was that the changes that are reflected based on the inputs\n\ngiven by M/s.KITCO and the clarifications given by IIT, should all be\n\nincorporated while executing the agreement with the successful\n\nbidder. It is to this aspect, that M/s.KITCO appears to make a\n\ncomment as per item No.4 of Ext.R-4(r) that the possibility of taking\n\nsuch a course of action and its possible future implications may be\n\nconfirmed by a legal/contract expert by the KSIDC in view of the\n\ncontract provisions and the CVC guidelines and that this is so\n\nsuggested by M/s.KITCO, as it is post tender changes, etc. It is not\n\nclear from the pleadings, materials on record as well as the files, as\n\nto whether the responsibility of M/s.KITCO was not only to give\n\ntechnical expert advice to KSIDC but also enter into the realm of\n\nmaking comments and remarks on administrative matters including\n\ncontractual aspects to be rendered by the KSIDC. At first blush it\n\nmay appear as if the role of M/s.KITCO should have been confined\n\nonly in the matter of tendering technical opinion and advice from\n\nthe engineering point of view and if that be so, it is not known as to\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">W.P.(C).13058/16                     -: 48 :-</span>\n\nthe reasons which promoted M/s.KITCO to make comments on the\n\nadministrative matters and contractual aspects, which are within the\n\nrealm of KSIDC. Be that as it may, it appears that this comment as\n\nper Ext.R-4(r) may also have weighed predominantly, while the\n\nmatter was thereafter placed for the consideration of Project\n\nImplementation Committee (PIC) of the KSIDC. Therefore, it appears\n\nthat, in spite of the receipt of the details from IIT as per Ext.R-4(n)\n\ndated 28.9.2015, Ext.R-4(o) dated 10.11.2015 and letter from\n\nM/s.KITCO as per Ext.R-4(p) on 30.11.2015, Ext.R-4(b)/R-4(q)\n\ndated 31.12.2015, etc. the competent authorities of R-2 KSIDC were\n\nof the well considered view that they could proceed with the\n\nissuance of the tender and the further steps to be taken for its\n\nfinalisation including 2 sets of extensions, opening of technical bid,\n\nopening of financial bids and admitting the petitioner as L1, etc.\n\nand this can only be on the basis of their considered opinion that\n\nvariations, if any, that is disclosed in this process, could well be\n\ntaken care of within the scope and ambit of Clause 35 (dealing with\n\nvariation) as stipulated in Ext.P-1. Clause 35 of Ext.P-1 reads as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">              &quot;Clause 35.

It was thereafter that the matter was placed before the\n\nProject Implementation Committee (PIC), which is chaired by the\n\nPrincipal Secretary to Government in the Industries Department and\n\nit also consists of Managing Director of the KSIDC and others. In\n\nview of the consistent stand taken by the 2nd respondent                    for\n\nproceeding at various stages of the tender starting from its\n\ncommencement upto the time immediately prior to the issuance of\n\nExt.R-4(p) dated 26.11.2015, the least that was expected from the\n\nrespondents was at least to get a complete technical and expert\n\nopinion as to whether the variation, which emerged in the instant\n\ncase would come within the scope and ambit of Clause 35 of\n\nExt.P-1 dealing with variation limits and if not, then the reasons\n\ntherefor and all other relevant aspects of the matter especially those\n\npertaining to the stand taken by the 2nd respondent in Ext.P-5 pre-\n\nbid query replies so that the PIC could take a final decision in that\n\nregard. This is all the more warranted as upto the time even\n\nimmediately prior to Ext.R-4(r) dated 17.2.2016, the authorities of\n\nR-2 KSIDC were of the considered view that the issues regarding the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 50 :-</span>\n\nvariations     as referred to in     Ext.R-4(b)/R-4(q)   letter dated\n\n31.12.2015 of M/s.KITCO and other aspects could be incorporated\n\nwhile executing the agreement with the successful tenderer, as can\n\nbe seen from a mere reading of item No.4 of Ext.R-4(r). In that\n\nregard even M/s.KITCO had specifically suggested the possibility of\n\nsuch course of action and its possible future implications are to be\n\nconfirmed with the expert opinion in terms of the provisions of the\n\ncontract and CVC guidelines. However, the files made available for\n\nthe perusal of this Court clearly disclose that no such expert opinion\n\nhas ever been obtained by R-2 either before taking the decision as\n\nper Ext.R-4(a) dated 1.3.2016 by the PIC or even thereafter, but\n\nbefore the issuance of the impugned proceedings. Page 188 of the\n\nmain file shows that the PIC consisted of 5 members; (1) Principal\n\nSecretary to Government in the Industries Department, (2) Managing\n\nDirector, KSIDC (3) Director, District Industries Centre (4) Managing\n\nDirector, KINFRA and (5) Addl. Secretary (Finance) presumably\n\nattached to the Government of Kerala. A reading of Ext.R-4(a) dated\n\n1.3.2016 as produced in the counter affidavit as well as pages 189\n\nto 191 of the main file would disclose that only 3 out of the said PIC\n\nmembers have attended the           PIC meeting that was held on\n\n1.3.2016, viz., (1) Principal Secretary to Government (Industries),\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">W.P.(C).13058/16                          -: 51 :-</span>\n\nwho is the chairman of the PIC,                    (2) Managing Director, KSIDC\n\n[member] and (3) (4) Managing Director, KINFRA.                            It appears that\n\nthe Director, District Industries Centre and the Addl. Secretary to\n\nGovernment of Kerala (Finance) were not present in the said\n\nmeeting. Ext.R-4(a) also shows that apart from the 3 available\n\nmembers of the PIC, the executive director of the KSIDC and the\n\nAssistant General Manager of the KSIDC were also present as\n\nofficers of the KSIDC. The relevant contents of Ext.R-4(a) read as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">       &quot;To execute the work relating to the Construction of Innovation cum Incubation\n       Centre at Life Science Park, Trivandrum.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">       building,PICnoted that Structural design and the BOQ and cost estimates of the\n                 namely Innovation cum Incubation Centre at the Life Sciences Park had\n       been completed and were submitted to IIT, Madras for vetting, at the time when\n       tender proceedings were initiated.

As noted hereinabove, no technical or expert opinion\n\nwas made available for the consideration of the PIC as to whether\n\nthe noted variations would come within the protection of Clause 35\n\nof Ext.P-1 dealing with permitted variation or whether it is totally\n\nbeyond the scope of that Clause and as to whether the execution of\n\nthe agreement with the successful tenderer as suggested by R-2 in\n\nitem 4 of Ext.R-4(r) would be in any manner inconsistent with the\n\nprovisions of the tender notice and the CVC guidelines, etc. Further\n\nthe respondents did not have a case that the 3 members of the PIC,\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">W.P.(C).13058/16                 -: 53 :-</span>\n\nwho attended the meeting, were in any manner professionally\n\ncompetent to assess any technical or expert aspects of engineering\n\ncontracts regarding the applicability or otherwise of Clause 30.\n\nThough 2 officers of the KSIDC were present, it is not discernible\n\neither from the files or from Ext.R-4(a), whether such officers or any\n\nother expert officers had given their well focused and well\n\nconsidered opinion regarding those aspects to the members of the\n\nPIC. As earlier noted, no attempt was made whatsoever to secure\n\nany such expert technical opinion, which could have been placed\n\nbefore the PIC.         The statement in Ext.R-4(a) to the effect that\n\n&quot;Meanwhile       the    IIT had submitted the vetted structural designs .....&quot;\n\nsuggests as if the IIT had submitted the structural designs only after\n\nthe opening of the financial bids on 4.12.2015, about which\n\nreference is made in the previous paragraphs. But the indisputable\n\nfact of the matter based on the documents produced by none other\n\nthan R-2 in the additional affidavit as well as in the main file is that\n\nthe IIT as per Ext.R-4(n) on 28.9.2015 had forwarded the requisite\n\ncalculations. It is thereafter that on 29.9.2015 the Technical Adviser\n\n(Civil) of the KSIDC has observed that though the quantities\n\nprovided for each items of work are likely to be increased or\n\ndecreased when the structural design is finalised, the estimate\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 54 :-</span>\n\nprepared on the tentative design can be proceeded with by going\n\nahead with the tender invitation, if approved and that according to\n\nhim, the provisions/ items given are satisfactory completion of the\n\nbuilding intended for a special purpose, etc. The said observation of\n\nthe Technical Adviser (Civil) has been approved by the competent\n\nauthority of R-2 KSIDC and it is only thereafter that the steps were\n\ntaken to proceed with the tender notification which resulted in the\n\npublication of Ext.P-1 e-tender on 2.10.2015. Still further on the\n\nreceipt of the detailed comments from the IIT on 10.11.2015 as per\n\nExt.R-4(o), the 2nd respondent had chosen to proceed with the\n\nopening of the technical bid on 26.11.2015 and with the opening of\n\nthe financial bid on 4.12.2015. So the aspects regarding the\n\nvariation was very much within the knowledge and cognizance of\n\nthe 2nd respondent while proceeding with each of the steps for the\n\ntender process as mentioned above.         What is mainly stated in\n\nExt.R-4(a) is that based on the inputs given by the IIT and\n\nM/s.KITCO, the cost estimates were reviewed, which resulted in the\n\nreduction of the estimate mainly due to the decrease in the quantity\n\nof revision suggested by M/s.KITCO and that the reduction in the\n\nestimate from Rs. 129.67 crores to Rs. 121.49 crores comes to\n\nRs.8.18 crores. The said variation by way of reduction comes to about\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">W.P.(C).13058/16                            -: 55 :-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">-6.31% of the original estimate. The actual details of the variation\n\nwere known to the 2nd respondent at least when Ext.R-4(b)/R-4(q)\n\nwas submitted by M/s.KITCO on 31.12.2015, to which R-2 had\n\nsubmitted their detailed comments and findings on 27.1.2016, as\n\nevident from pages 177 to 185 of the main file. Even immediately\n\nprior to Ext.R-4(r) dated 17.12.2015, the considered view of R-2 as\n\nreflected in item No.4 was that those variations could be\n\naccommodated in the agreement to be executed with the successful\n\nbidder. Based on this factual premise that there is a reduction in\n\nestimate to the tune of Rs. 8.18 crores, the PIC goes to conclude in\n\nthe penultimate paragraph of Ext.R-4(a) that &quot;Based on the detailed\n\ndeliberations and considering all relevant aspects, the PIC observed that in the given situation\n\nas detailed above, the right step to be taken is to cancel the present tender and initiate tendering\n\nprocedure afresh on reasons of procedural compliance and transparency&quot;. Other than\n\nreaching this conclusion, no proper reasons or grounds are cited by\n\nthe PIC at least as to the basic issue as to whether the said\n\nvariations would come within the scope and ambit of the protection\n\nenvisaged in Clause 35 of Ext.P-1 or whether it is beyond that\n\nClause or whether it is in any way inconsistent with the CVC\n\nguidelines, etc., which were the aspects to be examined even going\n\nby the comments of M/s.KITCO in item No.4 of Ext.R-4(r). When the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 56 :-</span>\n\nconsistent and repeated stand of R-2 was that those variations\n\ncould be validly accommodated in the agreement to be executed\n\nwith the successful tenderer and as reflected in their various\n\nfindings and assurances given in Ext.P-5 pre-bid query replies as\n\nreferred to herein above, the minimal requirements of fairness and\n\nreasonableness demanded that the PIC had secured a proper\n\ntechnical and expert advice on those aspects from the point of view\n\nof such engineering contract and then take a decision on those\n\naspects and to give their reasons thereof. True that as per the\n\nprovisions contained in Ext.P-1, a cancellation order as in Ext.P-18\n\ncommunicated to the tenderer, need not necessarily show or\n\ndisclose reasons therein, but it is trite law that such a clause does\n\nnot mean that a public authority like the 2nd respondent can act\n\neven in the absence of reasons for such reasons must be in\n\nexistence even if it is not communicated in the cancellation order as\n\nin Ext.P-18. Therefore, those reasonings consequent on the\n\ndeliberations of the PIC should have been shown in Ext.R-4(a) or at\n\nleast in the files. Such reasons are totally and conspicuously absent\n\neither in the files or in Ext.R-4(a) and no technical and expert advice\n\nor opinion are also seen placed for the consideration of the PIC. It is\n\nonly pursuant to the decision taken by the PIC as per Ext.R-4(a)\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 57 :-</span>\n\ndated 1.3.2016 that the impugned Ext.P-18 cancellation order\n\ndated 2.3.2016 has been issued in this case, consequent to which\n\nlater, the impugned Ext.P-21 re-tender proceedings were issued. In\n\nview of the abovesaid aspects, this Court, after due advertence to\n\nthe abovesaid case law on the subject, is of the considered view that\n\nthe impugned decision making, which led to the decision of the PIC,\n\nas reflected in Ext.R-4(a) and Ext.P-18 is, to say the least, grossly\n\nunfair, unreasonable and improper. Though as a matter of right a\n\ntenderer like the present petitioner may not have any vested right of\n\nhearing at that stage, the development in respect of the law of\n\nnatural justice has taken huge strides and it would have been only\n\nfair on the part of the 2nd respondent to have afforded a modicum of\n\nopportunity to the petitioner to present their case as to the\n\napplicability or otherwise of Clause 35 to the facts of this case and\n\nother relevant aspects. In this regard it is to be noted that it was the\n\npetitioner who pointed out various variations and mismatches in the\n\ndesign and piling quantities as can be seen from a reading of the\n\ndetailed pre-bid queries submitted by the petitioner as per Ext.P-4\n\nwhich resulted in Ext.P-5 responses and the assurances from the\n\n2nd respondent. Such a fair approach in calling upon the petitioner\n\nto present their version, would only have been in public interest,\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 58 :-</span>\n\nkeeping in view the fact that it was the petitioner&#x27;s pre-bid queries,\n\nwhich mainly resulted in Ext.P-5 and which later gave rise to the\n\ninputs from the IIT and M/s.KITCO,          etc. Even if a reasonable\n\nopportunity was not afforded to the petitioner, still this Court is of\n\nthe considered view that the impugned decision making process is\n\npalpably unfair, unreasonable and improper (see in this regard the\n\nwell considered treatment of law in this regard rendered by the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in paragraphs 84 to 94 of the judgment\n\ndated 4.12.2008 of the Division Bench of this Court in W.A.No.\n\n1460/2008, which has been affirmed by the Apex Court in order\n\ndated 10.2.2009 in S.L.P.(Civil) No.30305/2008 reported in (2009) 4\n\nSCC 563. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1696325\" id=\"span_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"801705\" id=\"span_99\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"227457\" id=\"span_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1283309\" id=\"span_101\">In the above judgment the Division Bench of this Court\n\nhas extensively surveyed the case law on the subject and has dealt with\n\nthe expanded horizons of natural justice even in such contractual matters\n\nplacing reliance on various judgments of the Apex Court as in <a href=\"/doc/1283309/\" id=\"a_81\">UOI v.\n\nE.G.Nambudiri</a>     reported in (<a href=\"/doc/227457/\" id=\"a_82\">1991) 3 SCC 38, Sarat Kumar Dash &amp;\n\nOrs. v.

Though no proper reasons or grounds are disclosed\n\neither in the files or in Ext.R-4(a) as to how and why clause 35 of\n\nExt.P-1 will not apply to the facts of this case, and as to how and\n\nwhy the earlier view of the 2nd respondent, as reflected in item 4 of\n\nExt.R-4(r), is not in consistence with the CVC guidelines, an attempt\n\nhas been made to plead in the affidavits filed by the 2nd respondent.\n\nFor instance, certain averments have been made in paras 6 and 7 of\n\nthe counter affidavit       regarding the piling depth and the cost\n\nreduction and about the inputs received from IIT and              M/s.KITCO,\n\netc. To that, the petitioner has filed reply affidavit, in which paras 9\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 61 :-</span>\n\nto 13 thereof deal with the said contentions raised by the 2nd\n\nrespondent. The petitioner has also placed reliance on Exts.P-22\n\nand P-27 to contend that variations, which resulted in the re-\n\ntender are minor and cosmetic changes compared to the original\n\ntender notification and that no substantial or significant changes are\n\nbrought about in the re-tender, etc. However, the said counter\n\naffidavit is silent as to the applicability of Clause 35 of Ext.P-1, in\n\nthe facts of this case.      Later the 2nd respondent has filed an\n\nadditional counter affidavit dated 11.7.2016 stating in para 13\n\nthereof that there has been substantial changes in quantities due to\n\nchange in pile design, addition, deletion of several items and change\n\nin rates and change in BOQ and that variation in quantity and\n\nvariation was more than 25%. However, the reasons as to how and\n\nwhy clause 35 of Ext.P-1 is not applicable to the facts of this case is\n\nnot properly and cogently explained therein. This is all the more so,\n\nin view of the consistent stand taken by the 2nd respondent, even\n\nfrom the time prior to the publication of Ext.P-1 e-tender and\n\nthereafter at various    stages, that they could go ahead with the\n\noriginal tender in spite of the variations as disclosed from the inputs\n\nfrom IIT and M/s.KITCO at various points of time. The petitioner\n\nwould mainly place reliance on clause 35 of Ext.P-1 as well as the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">W.P.(C).13058/16                        -: 62 :-</span>\n\ndefinite stand taken by the 2nd respondent in Ext.P-5 pre-bid\n\nqueries which have been referred to herein above as well as in the\n\npre-bid queries, as well as the consistent stand taken by the 2nd\n\nrespondent at various stages in the tender process. Apart from\n\nstating the aspects regarding the variation as referred to particularly\n\nin penultimate paragraph of Ext.R-4(a), the reason as to the non-\n\napplicability of clause 35 is not adverted or referred to therein.\n\nTherefore, the respondents cannot supplant further reasons or\n\ngrounds in the pleadings submitted by them in the defence of the\n\nimpugned action. This is all the more so, in view of the definite\n\nstand and green signal given by the Technical Adviser (Civil) of the\n\n2nd respondent on 29.9.2015 pointing out that there could be\n\nvariations on many counts, but that the interest of the speedy\n\ncompletion of the work demands that the tender be proceeded with\n\nand this was fully accepted by the the competent authorities of the\n\n2nd respondent which             resulted in the issuance of                Ext.P-1. In\n\nresponse to Ext.P-4 pre-bid queries submitted by the petitioner on\n\nvarious aspects including the piling work, BOQ variance, etc. the 2nd\n\nrespondent has taken the clear and categoric stand in items 34 to\n\n38 of Ext.P-5 that &quot;all the quantities in BOQ are tentative, which may vary plus or minus\n\nfor which the payment is made on actual measurements. The rates are based on Delhi Schedule\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">W.P.(C).13058/16                           -: 63 :-</span>\n\n\nof Rate (DSR) 46.67% for Trivandrum.

In this regard it is\n\nto be noted that such a ground is not adverted to either in the files or\n\nin Ext.R-4(a) or in any other materials made available to this Court, which\n\nled to the decision making process prior the impugned Ext.P-18. The\n\nrespondents do not have any specific case that their earlier consistent\n\nstand from 29.9.2015 upto the time immediately prior to Ext.R-4(r) was\n\nwrong.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">        28.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1008845\" id=\"span_114\">In this regard, it is to be noted that in the case in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1008845/\" id=\"a_93\">Commr. of Police v.

We find merit in this civil appeal. Standards applied by courts in\n       judicial review must be justified by constitutional principles which\n       govern the proper exercise exercise of public power in a democracy.\n       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution embodies the principle of &#x27;non\n       discrimiantion&#x27;. However it is not a free standing provision. It has to\n       be read in conjunction with rights conferred by other articles like\n       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The said <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 21</a> refers to &#x27;right to\n       life&#x27;. It includes &#x27;opportunity&#x27;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1906027\" id=\"span_124\">In our view, as held in latest judgment\n       of the Constitution Bench of nine Judges in <a href=\"/doc/1906027/\" id=\"a_104\">I.R Coelho v.

They cover various aspects of life. &#x27;Level playing\n       field&#x27; is an important concept while construing <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 19 (1)(g)</a> of the\n       Constitution. It is entitled to invoke the said doctrine of &#x27;level playing\n       field&#x27;. We may clarify that this doctrine is, however subject to public\n       interest. In the world of globalisation, competition is an important\n       factor to be kept in mind. The doctrine of &#x27;level playing field&#x27; is an\n       important doctrine which is embodied in <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the\n       Constitution. this is because the said doctrine provides space within\n       which equally placed competitors are allowed to bid so as to\n       subserve the larger public interest. &#x27;Globalisation&#x27;, in essence, is\n       liberalisation of trade. Today India has dismantled licence raj. The\n       economic reforms introduced after 1992 have brought in the concept\n       of &#x27;globalisation&#x27;. Decisions or acts which result in unequal and\n       discriminatory treatment, would violate the doctrine of &#x27;level playing\n       field&#x27; embodied in <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> Time has come, therefore, to say\n       that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 14</a> which refers to principle of &#x27;equality&#x27; should not be\n       read as a stand alone item but it should be read in conjunction with\n       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 21</a> which embodies several aspects of life. There is one more\n       aspect which needs to be mentioned in the matter of implementation\n       of the aforesaid doctrine of &#x27;level playing field&#x27;. According to Lord\n       Goldsmith, commitment to the &#x27;rule of law&#x27; is the heart of\n       parliamentary democracy. One of the important elements of the &#x27;rule\n       of law&#x27; is legal certainty. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 14</a> applies to government policies\n       and if the policy or act of the Government, even in contractual\n       matters, fails to satisfy the test of &#x27;reasonableness&#x27;, then such an act\n       or decision would be unconstitutional.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">       30.

This is\n\nespecially in view of the past consistent stand taken by the 2nd\n\nrespondent to proceed with the tender at various stages, in spite of\n\ninputs from IIT and M/s.KITCO. The last minute total turn around\n\nin the stand of the 2nd respondent, as reflected in Ext.R-4(a) would\n\namount to violation of the petitioner&#x27;s right to have his tender fairly\n\nand properly considered by the competent authority, even though\n\nhe cannot claim any right that his tender be accepted. Such a\n\nvolte-face in the stand of the 2nd respondent, which resulted in\n\nExt.P-2 is also vitiated by arbitrariness. In view of the consistent\n\nand definite stand earlier taken by the 2nd respondent at various\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 68 :-</span>\n\nstages of the tender process, the 2nd respondent was obliged to\n\naddress the crucial and relevant issue as to whether the variations\n\nas the result of the inputs of the IIT and M/s.KITCO, would come\n\nwithin the scope and ambit of protection afforded by clause 35 or\n\nwhether it is totally outside the purview of clause 35 and whether\n\nthe execution of the contract with the successful tender based on\n\nthe variations would be in any manner inconsistent with the\n\nprovisions of Ext.P-1 tender notice and CVC guidelines, etc. This\n\nshould have been done after securing technical and expert opinion\n\nin that regard from those who have specialized exposure and\n\nexperience in working out engineering contracts. Even if it is\n\nassumed that M/s.KITCO was within its competence to make\n\nsuggestions as in item 4 of Ext.R-4(r), it was all the more incumbent\n\non the respondents to have obtained such expert and technical\n\nopinion, as otherwise a sudden turn around from their earlier\n\nconsistent      stand,  will   amount      to     rank   arbitrariness\n\nunreasonableness and impropriety, etc. In para 2 on page 2 of the\n\nadditional affidavit dated 27.7.2016 filed by the 2nd respondent, it\n\nhas been clearly admitted that they have been following the norms\n\nof the PWD with regard to the invitation and processing of the\n\ntenders and that they are bound by the guildelines of the State\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">W.P.(C).13058/16                       -: 69 :-</span>\n\nGovernment as in                Ext.R-4(i) G.O(P).No.324/2015/Fin dated\n\n30.7.2015. So the           2nd respondent could have very well secured\n\ntechnical and expert opinion on the matters mentioned above from\n\nthe Governmental experts like, Chief Engineer (Buildings), Public\n\nWorks Department (PWD) of the State Government so that all the\n\nrelevant and crucial aspects mentioned above could have been\n\nexamined by their experts with due care and caution, which would\n\nhave enabled the PIC to take a wholesome look at the matter after\n\ntaking into account all these relevant and crucial aspects. Non-\n\nadvertence to these crucial and relevant aspects as pointed above,\n\nwould certainly vitiate the decision making process as per Ext.R-4(a)\n\nand Ext.P-18, in a grave and substantial manner. This Court has no\n\nhesitation to hold that the cumulative effect of all these aspects\n\ntouching the impugned decision making process, is giving rise to a\n\nsituation, wherein this Court is constrained to hold that &quot;something has\n\ngone wrong of a nature and degree, which requires the intervention in judicial review&quot; and it\n\nalso amounts violation of rudimentary principles of &quot;fairplay in action&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">and thus the impugned proceedings are vitiated by gross\n\narbitrariness.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1327287\" id=\"span_128\">31.

In this context it is important to emphasize that the\n       absence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule of law\n       upon which our whole constitutional system is based. In a system\n       governed by rule of law, discretion, when conferred upon executive\n       authorities, must be confined within clearly defined limits. The rule of\n       law from this point of view means that decisions should be made by\n       the application of known principles and rules and, in general, such\n       decisions should be predictable and the citizen should know where\n       he is. If a decision is taken without any principle or without any rule it\n       is unpredictable and such a decision is the antithesis of a decision\n       taken in accordance with the rule of law. (See Dicey, Law of the\n       Constitution, 10th edn., Introduction, cx). `Law has reached its finest\n       moments&#x27;, stated Douglas, J. in United States v. Wunderlich [342 US\n       98] , `when it has freed man from the unlimited discretion of some\n       ruler.... Where discretion is absolute, man has always suffered&#x27;. It is\n       in this sense that the rule of law may be said to be the sworn enemy\n       of caprice. Discretion, as Lord Mansfield stated it is classic terms in\n       the Case of John Wilkes [(1770) 4 Burr 2528] `means sound discretion\n       guided by law. It must be governed by rule, not humour: it must not\n       be arbitrary, vague and fanciful&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       32.     As regards the efficacy of norms as in clause 35 of Ext.P-1, it\n\nis to be noted that it is now well settled rule in administrative law by a\n\ncatena of decisions of the Apex Court and various High Courts that an\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">W.P.(C).13058/16                       -: 72 :-</span>\n\nexecutive authority must be rigorously held to the standards laid down by\n\nthe norms governing the field and that it must scrupulously adhere to the\n\nstandards laid down in the governing norms, as otherwise, the action of\n\nthe executive authority in violation of the such binding norms would\n\nresult in their invalidation.

Punjab [(1975) 3 SCC 503] and in subsequent decision\n       given in <a href=\"/doc/974148/\" id=\"a_118\">Sukhdev v. Bhagatram</a> [(1975) 1 SCC 421], Mathew, J.,\n       quoted the above-referred observations of Mr Justice Frankfurter with\n       approval. It may be noted that this rule, though supportable also as\n       an emanation from <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 14</a>, does not rest merely on that article. It\n       has an independent existence apart from <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 14.</a> It is a rule of\n       administrative law which has been judicially evolved as a check\n       against exercise of arbitrary power by the executive authority. If we\n       turn to the judgment of Mr Justice Frankfurter and examine it, we\n       find that he has not sought to draw support for the rule from the\n       equality clause of the United States Constitution, but evolved it purely\n       as a rule of administrative law. Even in England, the recent trend in\n       administrative law is in that direction as is evident from what is\n       stated at pp. 540-41 in Prof Wade&#x27;s &quot;Administrative Law&quot;, 4th Edn.\n       There is no reason why we should hesitate to adopt this rule as a part\n       of our continually expanding administrative law. Today with\n       tremendous expansion of welfare and social service functions,\n       increasing control of material and economic resources and large\n       scale assumption of industrial and commercial activities by the State,\n       the power of the executive Government to affect the lives of the\n       people is steadily growing. The attainment of socio-economic justice\n       being a conscious end of State policy, there is a vast and inevitable\n       increase in the frequency with which ordinary citizens come into\n       relationship of direct encounter with State power-holders. This\n       renders it necessary to structure and restrict the power of the\n       executive Government so as to prevent its arbitrary application or\n       exercise. Whatever be the concept of the Rule of Law, whether it be\n       the meaning given by Dicey in his &quot;The Law of the Constitution&quot; or\n       the definition given by Hayek in his &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot; and\n       &quot;Constitution of Liberty&quot; or the exposition set forth by Harry Jones in\n       his &quot;The Rule of Law and the Welfare State&quot;, there is as pointed out by\n       Mathew, J., in his article on &quot;The Welfare State, Rule of Law and\n       Natural Justice&quot; in &quot;Democracy, Equality and Freedom&quot; &quot;substantial\n       agreement in juristic thought that the great purpose of the rule of\n       law notion is the protection of the individual against arbitrary\n       exercise of power, wherever it is found&quot;. It is indeed unthinkable that\n       in a democracy governed by the rule of law the executive\n       Government or any of its officers should possess arbitrary power over\n       the interests of the individual. Every action of the executive\n       Government must be informed with reason and should be free from\n       arbitrariness. That is the very essence of the rule of law and its bare\n       minimal requirement. And to the application of this principle it makes\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">W.P.(C).13058/16                    -: 74 :-</span>\n\n       no difference whether the exercise of the power involves affectation\n       of some right or denial of some privilege.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">The rationale for evolving this administrative law is to ensure that\n\nthe actions of the Government should be free from arbitrariness by\n\ninsisting for adherence to the governing norms concerned. The\n\nApex Court held that this is very essence of rule of law and its bare\n\nminimal requirement.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"17881793\" id=\"span_138\">33.

Al Faheem Meetex Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr</a>\n\nreported in (2016) 4 SCC 716, and has contended that where the\n\ndecision making process has not reached any finality and was still in\n\nthe embryo and there was no acceptance of the bid, then no right,\n\nmuch less enforceable right, can be said to have been accrued to\n\nsuch a tenderer and that there is no question of giving any notice or\n\nhearing to the respondent and that therefore the impugned\n\nExt.P-18 cancellation proceedings are immunized from challenge by\n\nway of judicial review. Smt.Malini Ganesh, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the writ petitioner took this Court to the facts of that\n\ncase and has argued that <a href=\"/doc/17881793/\" id=\"a_122\">the said judgment</a> has no application to\n\nthe facts of this case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"17881793\" id=\"span_139\">In <a href=\"/doc/17881793/\" id=\"a_123\">Al Faheem Meetex</a>&#x27;s case supra, the Apex\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 75 :-</span>\n\nCourt has dealt with a case where the mandatory Financial Code\n\nRules of the Government stipulated that tender bids could be\n\nconsidered only if there were at least 3 or more valid bids. Among\n\nthe three bids submitted <a href=\"/doc/17881793/\" id=\"a_124\">in that case</a>, one was found to be invalid\n\nand the Bid Evaluation Committee (BEC) had selected the tenderer\n\nfrom amongst the two valid bids, in violation of the requirement of\n\nthe Rule. That Rule insisted the minimum Zone of Consideration of\n\nvalid bids, in order to ensure competitiveness in bids and it was\n\npresumed that if the valid bids are below the prescribed minimum,\n\nthen it could be due to lack of sufficient publicity. When the BEC was\n\nappraised       of their  mistake,     they   had     cancelled    their\n\nrecommendation. In these circumstances, the Apex Court held that\n\nthe impugned cancellation order cannot be said to be illegal. Further\n\nit was held therein that as the decision making process had not\n\nreached any finality and was still in embryo, there was enforceable\n\nright for the bidder to get the right of hearing before such\n\ncancellation. It was clearly found therein that the earlier\n\nrecommendation of the BEC to select the contractor was in violation\n\nof the mandatory Financial Code Rule. In the instant case, R-2 has\n\nno case that the petitioner&#x27;s bid was ineligible at the technical bid or\n\nfinancial bid stage or that there was no effective competitiveness at\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">W.P.(C).13058/16                          -: 76 :-</span>\n\nthese stages or that the further consideration of the tender process\n\nor the petitioner&#x27;s bid became ineligible at any stage. On the other\n\nhand, the consistent conduct and stand of R-2 at all the various\n\nstages was that the bids could be accommodated within the terms\n\nof the original tender notice. This Court is not holding that there\n\nwas a legal obligation to hear the petitioner before the issue of\n\nExt.R-4(a) or Ext.P-18, but only that it would have much more fairer\n\nand proper to have afforded an opportunity to the petitioner at that\n\nstage. This Court is only holding that the impugned decision making\n\nprocess is tainted due to the aspects mentioned hereinabove. For all\n\nthese reasons, the ratio of the aforesaid Apex Court ruling cannot\n\nbe pressed into service against the petitioner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">       34.     The case laws of the Apex Court and various High Courts\n\nare in legion and it is also supported by scholarly authorities\n\nreferred to herein above that &quot;although the tenderer had no right to claim that his\n\ntender be accepted, yet he did have a right to have his tender fairly and properly considered by\n\n\nthe authority concerned ..... ...&quot;  Even in celebrated Shrilekha Vidyarathi&#x27;s\n\ncase [see (1991) 1 SC 212, paras 20, 24 etc.) the Apex Court held\n\nthat applicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_125\">Art.14</a> to all executive actions of the State being\n\nwell settled and for the same reason its applicability at the threshold\n\nto the making of a contract in exercise of the executive power is\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 77 :-</span>\n\nbeyond dispute and further that even if the post contractual stage,\n\nthe State has no power to       cast off its personality and exercise\n\nunbridled power unfettered by the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_126\">Art. 14</a> in the\n\nsphere of contractual matters and claim to be governed therein only\n\nby private law principles applicable to private individuals whose\n\nrights flow only from the terms of the contract without anything\n\nmore, etc. Therefore, the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_127\">Art.14</a> at the threshold of\n\nmaking of a contractor in exercise of the executive power is beyond\n\ndispute. Therefore, in the light of all these aspects, the irresistible\n\nconclusion that is to be drawn is that the impugned action is vitiated\n\nby gross and flagrant violation of       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_128\">Art.14</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">       35.    Sri.M.Pathros Matthai, learned Senior Counsel appearing\n\nfor the respondents has also raised a contention that after the\n\nissuance of the impugned Ext.P-21 re-tender notice, the petitioner\n\nhad downloaded the tender forms and had raised pre-bid queries\n\nand that therefore the petitioner is barred by estoppel and\n\nacquiescence in challenging the impugned Ext.P-18 cancellation\n\norder. Smt.Malini Ganesh, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nwrit petitioner submitted various details and contended that there is\n\nno question of applicability of principles of estoppel in the facts of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 78 :-</span>\n\nthis case. On an examination of the facts of this case, it seen that\n\nthe deadline for submission of the tender in pursuance of the\n\nimpugned Ext.P-21 revised tender notice dated 3.3.2016 was upto\n\n31.3.2016. The petitioner had submitted Ext.P-23 pre-bid queries\n\ndated 14.3.2016, the deadline for bid submission was initially\n\nextended upto 11.4.2016 and was subsequently extended upto\n\n24.4.2016 and was thereafter extended upto 12.5.2016. The\n\npetitioner had submitted bid for revised tender on 23.4.2016. But it\n\nis to be crucially noted that immediately after the receipt of the\n\nimpugned        Ext.P-18 cancellation   order  dated    2.3.2016,    the\n\npetitioner has submitted Ext.P-19 representation dated 3.3.2016\n\nraising serious objections before the 2nd respondent against the\n\ncancellation of the tender bid, the details of which have already\n\nbeen pointed out herein above. The present Writ Petition (Civil) was\n\nfiled before this Court on 1.4.2016. Therefore, the outcome of\n\nExt.P-18 proceedings and the consequential proceedings like\n\nExt.P-21, etc. are subject to and dependent upon the outcome of the\n\nwrit proceedings initiated by the writ petitioner. Thereafter this\n\nCourt had passed an order dated 4.4.2016 in this W.P.(C). directing\n\nthat the finalisation of the tender bid based on Ext.P-21 is stayed for a\n\nperiod of 2 months and the said order was later extended until\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 79 :-</span>\n\nfurther orders as per order dated 30.5.2016. Therefore, the\n\nimpugned Ext.P-18 proceedings and all other consequential\n\nproceedings in pursuance thereof including Ext.P-21 are subject to\n\nand dependent upon the further orders to be passed in this Writ\n\nPetition as well as the final outcome of this W.P.(C). As noted above\n\nthe petitioner has submitted the tender bid on 23.4.2016. Merely\n\nbecause the petitioner had raised certain pre-bid queries and had\n\nsought extension of time will not by itself amount to estoppel and\n\nacquiescence on his part to challenge        the impugned Ext.P-15\n\ncancellation order, more so particularly, in the light of the fact that\n\nhe had placed serious objections against the said impugned\n\nExt.P-18 order by submitting Ext.P-20 representation as early as\n\non 4.3.2016 itself, and has also subsequently initiated the present\n\nwrit proceedings. No person can predict with exactitude as to\n\nwhether he will fully succeed or not in the litigative proceedings and\n\ntherefore in the context of said facts and circumstances in this case,\n\nthe petitioner cannot be blamed for having submitted his tender\n\nbid, as the entire impugned proceedings and also the consequential\n\nproceedings thereto, are subject to the further orders and final\n\noutcome of the present Writ Petition. Hence this Court is of the view\n\nthat the contention of the 2nd respondent that the petitioner is\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 80 :-</span>\n\nestopped from challenging the impugned Ext.P-18 proceedings and\n\nconsequential proceedings like Ext.P-21, is not tenable and the\n\nsame is overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">       36.    It has also been urged by R-2 that as the petitioner has\n\nsought a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to issue the\n\nwork allotment to the petitioner, third parties especially those who\n\nhad taken part in the tender proceedings could have challenged if\n\nthe work had been alloted to the petitioner with the modification\n\nand variations, etc. and that therefore non-impleadment of such\n\nparties, who are necessary parties, will be fatal. Smt.Malini Ganesh,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing for the writ petitioner submits\n\nthat as the main prayer of the petitioner is only a challenge against\n\nthe impugned Ext.P-18 cancellation proceedings and as the other\n\nprayers are fully consequential thereto, such other bidders cannot\n\nbe said to be necessary parties and even if they are viewed as\n\nproper parties, non-impleadment is not fatal and further that the\n\nre-tender bidders are fully aware about the stay order passed by\n\nthis Court in this W.P.(C). and such persons have not chosen to\n\ncome forward so as to oppose the prayers in this Writ Petition. On a\n\nconsideration of the rival pleas in this regard, as this Court is not\n\nproposing to issue writ of mandamus for allotment of work to the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 81 :-</span>\n\npetitioner in this proceedings, the stage for entertaining any legally\n\njusticiable grievances, if any, by such parties has not yet arisen and\n\ntherefore the impleadment of such parties is not now necessary,\n\neven if such parties are treated as necessary parties for considering\n\nthe prayer for such a writ of mandamus. The rival bidders in the\n\noriginal tender had participated in the tender process at all stages\n\nand none of them has ever raised any objection at any time that the\n\noriginal bids cannot be accommodated within the terms and\n\nconditions of that tender and that it is liable to be cancelled for\n\nissue of re-tender, etc. R-2 would even contend that not even the\n\nlowest tenderer has any right to be heard before a decision is taken\n\non the question whether L-1 should be allotted the work. In these\n\ncircumstances, at any rate, the rival bidders in the original tender\n\ncannot be said to have any rights to be affected before a decision is\n\ntaken by the competent authority at the post Ext.P-15 stage on the\n\nquestion whether allotment of work to L-1 will come within the\n\nscope of Clause 35 and the applicable Governmental norms. Ext.P-\n\n21 re-tener proceedings is purely a consequential proceedings as a\n\nresult of Ext.P-18 and its fate is fully dependent upon the fate of\n\nExt.P-18. Therefore, bidders of Ext.P-21 cannot be said to have any\n\nrights to be heard for deciding on the validity of Ext.P-18. Of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 82 :-</span>\n\ncourse, if any such bidders, had voluntarily approached this Court at\n\nthe appropriate time, their request for impleadment could have\n\nbeen considered. But none of them has chosen to come forward\n\nwith any such pleas. For all these reasons, the contentions regarding\n\nnon-impleadment will stand overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">       37.    The  petitioner  has    raised  certain   allegations  of\n\nmalafides, favouritism, etc. In the view proposed to be taken by this\n\nCourt in this case, it is not in any way necessary to examine and\n\nresolve the rival pleas in this regard. The petitioner has also raised\n\ncertain contentions regarding the manner in which some tender\n\nbids were entertained in the re-tender. It is not necessary for this\n\nCourt to enter into those areas and all such contentions are left\n\nopen. Smt.Malini Ganesh, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner,\n\nhad placed reliance on certain orders and guidelines of the Central\n\nVigilance Commission. As the matter is proposed to be remitted, it\n\nis for both sides to highlight all such aspects, at the time of remit.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">       38.    The upshot of the above discussion is that the impugned\n\nExt.P-18 proceedings is liable to be interdicted in judicial review.\n\nHowever, it is to be noted that this Court has endeavoured only for\n\nexamining the impugned decision making process, which led to the\n\noutcome in question and this Court has not examined the merits of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">W.P.(C).13058/16                -: 83 :-</span>\n\nthe matter, in order to hold that the impugned Ext.P-18\n\nproceedings is illegal, etc. This Court has only taken the view that\n\nthe impugned decision making process, which led to Ext.P-18 is\n\nvitiated by arbitrariness, unreasonableness, impropriety and non\n\nconsideration of relevant aspects, and therefore, the same is in\n\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_129\">Art.14</a>, etc.   This Court is also of the view that at this\n\nstage it is not proper and fit for this Court to enter into the realm of\n\nadjudication of the merits of the matter as to whether the variations\n\nin question would come within the scope and ambit of protection\n\nafforded by Clause 35 and such other contentions urged by the\n\npetitioner. That is to be fully and properly examined by persons\n\nwith expertise, who have sufficient experience in handling and\n\nmanaging engineering contracts in building construction. As\n\npointed out herein above, the 2nd respondent has clearly admitted in\n\npara 2 on page 2 of their additional affidavit dated 27.2.2016 that\n\nthey are following the norms of the Public Works Department with\n\nregard to invitation and processing of tenders and             that the\n\nguidelines issued by the State Government as per Ext.R- 4(i) G.O(P).\n\nNo.324/2015/Fin. dated 30.7.2015 regarding the execution of\n\npublic works in the State, are being followed by the 2nd respondent,\n\netc. This Court    is inclined to hold that Ext.R-4(a) and Ext.P-18\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 84 :-</span>\n\nproceedings are ultra vires and unreasonable for the aforestated\n\nreasons and to remit the matter to the competent authority for\n\nconsideration of the entire matter afresh from the stage\n\nimmediately prior to the issuance of Ext.R-4(a). As already noted\n\nherein above, for that purpose, the competent authority (PIC) should\n\nbe equipped with expert technical opinion in the matter on the\n\npoints noted herein above. The Chief Engineer (Buildings) of the\n\nPublic Works Dept. of the Government of Kerala and the various\n\nexperts under him may have wealth of experience in dealing with\n\ntenders in engineering contracts in building constructions, etc. and\n\nthis Court is of the view that in order to ensure that the further\n\ndecision making process is based on objective and transparent basis\n\nguided by expert and technical opinion in the matter, it is ordered\n\nthat the Chief Engineer, PWD (Buildings) will render necessary\n\nassistance and give requisite technical and expert opinion on the\n\nmatters      mentioned above. For this purpose, the Chief Engineer\n\n(Buildings) will immediately constitute an expert committee\n\nconsisting of himself and 2 other senior and high ranking engineers\n\nbelonging to his Department, chosen by him. If the Chief Engineer\n\n(Buildings) is of the view that the assistance of an expert engineer\n\nhaving sufficient experience in Design/Structural Design is\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 85 :-</span>\n\nnecessary, then he will be at liberty to additionally co-opt such an\n\nexpert by requisitioning him from amongst the engineering\n\npersonnel alloted under the Chief Engineer (Design), PWD, after\n\nconsultation with that authority. The said committee will examine\n\nthe entire matter with reference to the materials on record, which\n\nare to be made available by the 2nd respondent and give an expert\n\nand technical opinion as to whether the variations that has emerged\n\nin this case will come within the scope and ambit of the protection\n\nafforded by Clause 35 of terms and conditions of Ext.P-1 tender\n\nbid or whether it is outside the scope of that clause. So also it\n\nshould be examined whether the execution of the agreement with\n\nthe lowest tenderer pursuant to Ext.P-1 with the abovesaid\n\nvariations would be in any manner inconsistent with the\n\nGovernmental norms, if any, that are applicable to the tender bids\n\nof the KSIDC and the           applicable CVC (Central Vigilance\n\nCommission) guidelines. In this regard, the said committee headed\n\nby the Chief Engineer (Buildings) PWD should also examine the\n\nearlier consistent stand taken by the 2nd respondent right from\n\n29.9.2015 upto the time prior to the issuance of Ext.R-4(r) dated\n\n17.2.2016 and also the clear and definite stand taken by the 2nd\n\nrespondent in Ext.P-5 pre-bid query reply as mentioned herein\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">W.P.(C).13058/16                 -: 86 :-</span>\n\nabove and examine whether their said earlier stand was proper and\n\ncorrect in terms of the terms and conditions contained in Ext.P-1,\n\nmore particularly Clause 35 thereof, and also whether the changes\n\nand variations in the re-tender proceedings are only minor and\n\ncosmetic changes as contended by the petitioner or whether they\n\nare    substantial  or    significant   changes,    which    cannot  be\n\naccommodated within the terms and conditions of Ext.P-1 tender\n\nterms and conditions as well as other applicable Governmental\n\nnorms, if any, as stated above and also whether the original tender\n\ncould be proceeded with as contended by the petitioner or whether\n\nre-tender is inevitable going by the terms and conditions and the\n\nnorms governing the field. For enabling the said expert committee\n\nheaded by the Chief Engineer (Buildings), PWD, to render their\n\ntechnical and expert opinion, the 2nd respondent will submit their\n\nwritten submissions in the matter along with the entire files and\n\nrecords and should also produce a copy of this judgment before the\n\nChief Engineer (Buildings) PWD, within a period of ten days from the\n\ndate of receipt of a certified copy of this judgment. So also the\n\npetitioner will be at liberty to give their detailed written submissions\n\nalong with requisite materials and documents, that he may wish to\n\nproduce, before the Chief Engineer (Buildings) PWD, and it will also\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">W.P.(C).13058/16              -: 87 :-</span>\n\nbe open to them to produce details like Exts.P-22, P-27, etc. in aid\n\nof their submissions and contentions. The petitioner will make\n\navailable their written submissions and other materials before the\n\nChief Engineer (Buildings), PWD, along with a copy of this judgment\n\nwithin a period of 10 days from the date of receipt of a certified\n\ncopy of this judgment. The Chairman of the PIC as well as the\n\nManaging Director of the 2nd respondent KSIDC will also take\n\nnecessary steps so as to facilitate proper and co-ordinated action\n\nwith the Chief Engineer (Buildings) PWD, Government of Kerala.\n\nUpon receipt of all the necessary papers as indicated above, the\n\nChief Engineer (Buildings) PWD will ensure that the abovesaid expert\n\ncommittee headed by him examines all the relevant aspects of the\n\nmatter and render their technical and expert opinion on the points\n\nas mentioned above, by submitting a report in this regard to the 2nd\n\nrespondent, within a period of 3 weeks from the date of receipt of\n\nthe abovesaid papers from the petitioner and the 2nd respondent. A\n\ncopy of the said report should also be made available by the Chief\n\nEngineer (Buildings), PWD, as well as by the Managing Director of\n\nthe    2nd    respondent to  the  petitioner  or   their authorised\n\nrepresentative immediately. After receipt of the said report of the\n\nexpert committee, the Project Implementation Committee (PIC) of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">W.P.(C).13058/16               -: 88 :-</span>\n\nthe 2nd respondent KSIDC will consider the entire matter afresh on\n\nthe points noted herein above. This Court is of the view that it is\n\nonly appropriate and fit that a reasonable opportunity is given by\n\nthe PIC to the petitioner through their authorised representative to\n\npresent their versions in the matter based on their contentions and\n\nsubmissions as well as the matters that will emerge from the report\n\nof the expert committee. After permitting the petitioner through\n\ntheir authorised representative to present their versions as stated\n\nabove, the PIC will take a final decision on the points noted herein\n\nabove, and decide whether further steps could be taken for\n\nproceeding with the tender notice in the stage of Exts.P-14 and\n\nP-15 or whether the re-tender is to be proceeded with.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">       39.    As the impugned Ext.P-21 revised tender proceedings is\n\nconsequential to the impugned Ext.P-18 proceedings, ordinarily\n\nwith the quashing Ext.P-18, Ext.P-21 would also have been\n\ninterfered with by this Court. However, taking into account the\n\npublic interest involved in this matter, this Court is not now\n\nquashing the impugned Ext.P-21 and it is ordered that the fate of\n\nExt.P-21 will be dependent on the decision to be taken by the PIC\n\nconsequent to the remit, as directed above. It is thus made clear\n\nthat if the decision of the PIC consequent to the remit is to proceed\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">W.P.(C).13058/16                   -: 89 :-</span>\n\nfurther with the original tender from the stage from Ext.P-14 and\n\nP-15, then the impugned Ext.P-21 revised tender notice will stand\n\nautomatically rescinded. If on the other hand, the decision of the\n\nPIC is to cancel the original tender bids and going for fresh tender,\n\nthen R-2 could take steps to go ahead with the further proceedings\n\npursuant to Ext.P-21 and for that purpose, there is no necessity to\n\nissue any fresh retender as it would be waste of time and money\n\nand will not be conducive to public interest. It is made clear that all\n\nthe observations and findings in this judgment are only from the\n\nlimited perspective to decide as to whether the impugned decision\n\nmaking process has been vitiated or not, and none of the\n\nobservations and findings in this judgment can be construed as an\n\nexpression on the merits of the matter, for those are matters to be\n\ndecided by the PIC consequent to the remit of the matter after\n\nsecuring the expert committee&#x27;s guidance as directed above.
