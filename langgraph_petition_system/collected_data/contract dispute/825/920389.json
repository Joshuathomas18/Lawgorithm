A bare perusal of Clause 27 together with\n   \n\n\n\n     other clauses would make it apparent that in case\n\n     of     disputes     as    to     quality,        application           for\n\n\n\n\n\n     arbitration       is     to be made to the           President          of\n\n     East India Cotton Association within 30 days from\n\n     the     last date of landing of the steamer and such\n\n\n\n\n\n     dispute     shall      be against the foreign               suppliers\n\n     only     and not against the Corporation.                   The claim\n\n     for     quality     allowance      will be settled              by     the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:24:51 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                           44</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n                                                  \n     mills     with the foreign suppliers and amounts, if\n\n     any, received from the shippers will be paid over\n\n     to the mills to the extent the amount is actually\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n     received.

If annexure U to             the\n\n     plaint        is perused, it is apparent that principal\n\n     amount\n                          \n                   due is Rs.12,28,177.78 which is identical\n\n     to the sum referred to in para 2 above.
