In this regard, the learned\n                      Arbitrator has rightly held that it was not possible for advance to be\n                      recovered as per Clause 1.2.08 due to the low turnover rate caused solely\n                      by the petitioner‟s breaches.

What is clear, therefore, is that the expression &quot;public\n                             policy of India&quot;, whether contained in Section 34 or in\n                             Section 48, would now mean the &quot;fundamental policy of\n                             Indian law&quot; as explained in paragraphs 18 and 27 of\n                             Associate Builders (supra), i.e., the fundamental policy of\n                             Indian law would be relegated to the &quot;Renusagar&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                             understanding of this expression. This would necessarily\n                             mean that the Western Geco (supra) expansion has been\n                             done away with. In short, Western Geco (supra), as\n                             explained in paragraphs 28 and 29 of Associate Builders\n                             (supra), would no longer obtain, as under the guise of\n                             interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitrator\n                             has not adopted a judicial approach, the Court„s\n                             intervention would be on the merits of the award, which\n                             cannot be permitted post amendment. However, insofar as\n                             principles of natural justice are concerned, as contained in\n                             Sections 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the 1996 Act, these continue\n                             to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in\n                             paragraph 30 of Associate Builders (supra).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\">                             xxxxxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">                             25. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now\n                             constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is\n                             contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as\n                             understood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders\n                             (supra), or secondly, that such award is against basic\n                             notions of justice or morality as understood in paragraphs\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                      O.M.P.

Insofar as domestic awards made in\n                            India are concerned, an additional ground is now available\n                            under sub-section (2A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015,\n                            to Section 34. Here, there must be patent illegality\n                            appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such\n                            illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does\n                            not amount to mere erroneous application of the law. In\n                            short, what is not subsumed within &quot;the fundamental policy\n                            of Indian law&quot;, namely, the contravention of a statute not\n                            linked to public policy or public interest, cannot be brought\n                            in by the backdoor when it comes to setting aside an award\n                            on the ground of patent illegality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">                            27. Secondly, it is also made clear that re-appreciation of\n                            evidence, which is what an appellate court is permitted to\n                            do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality\n                            appearing on the face of the award.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                            28. To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of Associate Builders\n                            (supra), namely, a mere contravention of the substantive\n                            law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground available to set\n                            aside an arbitral award. Paragraph 42.2 of Associate\n                            Builders (supra), however, would remain, for if an\n                            arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes\n                            Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount\n                            to a patent illegality on the face of the award.\n                            xxxxxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">                            30. What is important to note is that a decision which is\n                            perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31 and 32 of\n                            Associate Builders (supra), while no longer being a ground\n                            for challenge under &quot;public policy of India&quot;, would\n                            certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face\n                            of the award. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or\n                            an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its\n                            decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                      O.M.P.

The duty to adopt a judicial approach\n                                  arises from the very nature of the power exercised by\n                                  the court or the authority does not have to be\n                                  separately or additionally enjoined upon the for a\n                                  concerned. What must be remembered is that the\n                                  importance of a judicial approach in judicial and\n                                  quasi-judicial determination lies in the fact that so\n                                  long as the court, tribunal or the authority exercising\n                                  powers that affect the rights or obligations of the\n                                  parties before them shows fidelity to judicial\n                                  approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious\n                                  or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that\n                                  the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject\n                                  in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its\n                                  decision is not actuated by any extraneous\n                                  consideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as\n                                  a check against flaws and faults that can render the\n                                  decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to\n                                  challenge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_67\">                                  xxxxxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">                                  38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the\n                                  policy of Indian law is the principle that a court and\n                                  so also a quasi judicial authority must, while\n                                  determining the rights and obligations of parties\n                                  before it, do so in accordance with the principles of\n                                  natural justice. Besides the celebrated audi alteram\n                                  partem rule one of the facets of the principles of\n                                  natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the\n                                  matter must apply its mind to the attendant facts and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                      O.M.P.

It is neither necessary nor\n                                  proper for us to attempt an exhaustive enumeration of\n                                  what would constitute the fundamental policy of\n                                  Indian law nor is it possible to place the expression in\n                                  the straitjacket of a definition.

It is settled law that where:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                    1. a finding is based on no evidence, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                                    2. an arbitral tribunal takes into account something\n                                    irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                                    3. ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision,\n                                    such decision would necessarily be perverse.\n                            xxxxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                            33. It must clearly be understood that when a court is\n                            applying the &quot;public policy&quot; test to an arbitration award, it\n                            does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of\n                            fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator\n                            on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is\n                            the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to\n                            be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an\n                            award based on little evidence or on evidence which does\n                            not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not\n                            be held to be invalid on this score . Once it is found that the\n                            arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he\n                            is the last word on facts......&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                      46.   It is therefore clear that the decisive test is that first, the learned\n                      Arbitrator had to adopt a judicial approach; second, the principles of\n                      natural justice had to be upheld; third, the decision must not have been\n                      egregious, or rather, perverse.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                      47.

From a bare reading of the above-quoted portion of the impugned\n                      Award, it can be inferred that the Arbitrator has given careful thought\n                      before framing the Award, and has considered all the relevant documents\n                      on record to reach his decision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">                      53.

In the instant case, the Petitioner claimed that\n                      the Arbitrator mis-appreciated the evidence on record, but the learned\n                      Arbitrator has relied upon the letter dated 20 th October 1987 to adjudicate\n                      upon the issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">                      55.

Accordingly, with reference to the aforesaid judgments and the\n                      impugned Arbitral Award, the Petitioner cannot have the benefit of the\n                      „ground of patent illegality‟ to assail the impugned Arbitral Award under\n                      <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 34</a> of the Act, 1996.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                      O.M.P.

The arbitration was invoked by the claimant\n                            vide a letter dated 18th January 1988 and the statement of\n                            claim was filed by the Claimant on 12th November 1988.\n                            Accordingly, in the given facts and circumstances of the\n                            case, I find that the relevant start date for the purposes of\n                            claim for interest by the claimant should be 18th January\n                            1988. It can be seen that this is a unique case in which the\n                            arbitration proceedings have gone on for a period 32 years.\n                            Considering the length of the time elapsed, the value of\n                            money has shrunk to negligible. Another factor to be taken\n                            into consideration is clause 1. 2.07(a) on page 33 of the\n                            contract agreement wherein it can be seen that both parties\n                            have agreed to a simple interest @14% per annum. Further\n                            the provisions of section 31(7) (a) of the Arbitration and\n                            Conciliation act 1996 provides that where the award is for\n                            payment of money then interest can be awarded at such rate\n                            as may be deemed reasonable by the Arbitral Tribunal from\n                            the date of cause of action till date of payment or for such\n                            part period as the case may be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">                            Therefore, in the facts circumstances of the present case, I\n                            hold, that the rate of interest at the rate of 14% simple\n                            interest with effect from 12th November 1988 upto the date\n                            of award shall be a reasonable rate to be awarded as\n                            interest to the claimant on the awarded amount. The said\n                            interest @ 14% is therefore accordingly awarded and\n                            allowed in favour of the claimant. I, further award interest to\n                            the claimant @ 18% simple interest, from the date· of the\n                            award till the date of payment of the awarded amount.\n                            The issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimant.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">                      58.

Indeed, the circular itself expressly stipulates that it\n                            cannot apply unless the Contractors furnish an\n                            undertaking/affidavit that the price adjustment under the\n                            circular is acceptable to them. We have seen how the\n                            appellant gave such undertaking only conditionally and\n                            without prejudice to its argument that the Circular does not\n                            and cannot apply. This being the case, it is clear that the\n                            majority Award has created a new Contract for the parties\n                            by applying the said unilateral circular and by substituting a\n                            workable formula under the Agreement by another formula\n                            dehors the Agreement. This being the case, a fundamental\n                            principle of justice has been breached, namely, that a\n                            unilateral addition or alteration of a Contract can never be\n                            foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party to the\n                            Agreement be liable to perform a bargain not entered into\n                            with the other party. Clearly, such a course of conduct\n                            would be contrary to fundamental principles of justice as\n                            followed in this country, and shocks the conscience of this\n                            Court.

In this case the matter was referred to\n                            an arbitrator while an appeal was pending between the\n                            parties against a judgment of the original court and the\n                            point canvassed was as to what was the subject of the\n                            submission to arbitration; whether it was the whole dispute\n                            and not merely the matter of appeal.

The arbitrator ought not to include\n                            evidence or refer to or discuss authorities making his award\n                            more like the judgment of judge which is subject to appeal\n                            than the award of an arbitrator.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">                            26.

It is understood from a bare reading of the above cited judgment,\n                      that it is a long-standing principle that the Arbitrator is the Sole Authority\n                      in the Arbitral Proceedings. Arbitrator is not bound by a rigid law of\n                      procedure in order to enable smooth adjudication of the disputes and\n                      ensure that the parties are granted relief.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">                      84.

However, despite agreeing with the claimant on the\n                      existence of fraud in the proceedings, the court held that the fraudulent\n                      testimony did not justify setting the award aside, because „even if the true\n                      position had been disclosed to the tribunal, that would, in all probability,\n                      not have affected the result of the arbitration.

Therefore, as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, in the\n                      present petition, the learned Sole Arbitrator has erred in decreeing the\n                      award with respect to the rate of interest, and hence, the Award qua issue\n                      no. 20 with regards to the rate of interest is liable to be set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                      88.

Therefore,\n                      the impugned Award is set aside only with regard to the rate of interest,\n                      where perversity, and thus patent illegality has been observed. Therefore,\n                      issue no. 20 is set aside for being patently illegal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">                      94.   Hence, the instant petition is disposed of in the aforementioned\n                      manner. The Award qua issue no. 20 is set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">                      95.   Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">                      96.
