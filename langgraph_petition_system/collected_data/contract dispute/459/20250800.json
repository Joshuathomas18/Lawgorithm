On 5th January, 2018, in several appeals/SLPs arising out of Order\nNo.1, the Supreme Court passed the following order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">            &quot;Delay condoned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                  In this group of cases some of the petitioners\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">RFA 573/2017                                                        Page 17 of 47</span>\n            have been paid the principal amount and the earnest\n           money whereas some of the petitioners have been paid\n           only the principal amount. Some of the petitioners have\n           not been paid even the principal amount. Such of the\n           petitioners who have not been paid the principal\n           amount/earnest money/security deposit be paid the\n           amounts due under the aforesaid heads.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">           The present Special Leave Petitions have been filed\n           against order(s) of the High Court which appears to be\n           consent order(s).

We are not\n           inclined to go into the said aspect of the matter.\n           However, we leave it open for the petitioners to agitate\n           the said question before the High Court, if they are so\n           advised.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">                  With the aforesaid observation, the present\n           Special Leave Petitions as well as all pending\n           applications therein shall stand disposed of&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">21.    The Supreme Court directed payments to be made to the Contractors\nwho approached the Court by way of SLPs, &quot;in the meantime&quot;, on the first\nhearing. By the order disposing of the SLPs, the payment of Principal\namount, Earnest money and Security deposit were directed to be made. This\nin effect meant that the said Contractors were not to stand in the queue but\npayments were released to them under Supreme Court orders. The Supreme\nCourt did not adjudicate the matter on the question of interest or the question\nas to whether consent was given.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">22.    Thus, in effect, Order No.1 dated 1st December, 2016, to the extent\nthat it gave sanctity to the queue system which was also subsequently\nfollowed by Learned Single Judges of this Court, appears to have been\nsuperseded by the Supreme Court insofar as the Queue system of payment is\nconcerned. In any event, all the three issues on which consent had been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">RFA 573/2017                                                       Page 18 of 47</span>\n initially recorded in order dated 1st December, 2016 i.e. payment of principal\non queue basis, payment of interest only after three years and 90 days, as\nalso security deposit, was open for re-agitation. Order No.1 was in effect\nmodified in respect of the Contractors who approached the Supreme Court.\nSubsequent Orders No.2, 3 and 4 are passed on the basis of Order No.1. On\nthe issues of law raised in those appeals and writs, there was no decision on\nmerits.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"327169\" id=\"span_39\">23.    It is settled as far back as in 1989, when the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/327169/\" id=\"a_5\">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur</a> (1989) 1 SCC 101 held\nthat consent orders do not adjudicate upon the merits of the dispute and\nhence do not constitute binding precedents. Relevant extract of the judgment\nis as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">           &quot;10. It is axiomatic that when a direction or order is\n           made by consent of the parties, the court does not\n           adjudicate upon the rights of the parties nor does it lay\n           down any principle. Quotability as „law‟ applies to the\n           principle of a case, its ratio decidendi. The only thing\n           in a judge‟s decision binding as an authority upon a\n           subsequent judge is the principle upon which the case\n           was decided. Statements which are not part of the ratio\n           decidendi are distinguished as obiter dicta and are not\n           authoritative...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151408328\" id=\"span_40\">This position taken by the Supreme Court has been followed by a Single\nJudge of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/151408328/\" id=\"a_6\">Yash Sehrawat v. Board of Control</a> for Cricket in\nIndia 2014 (141) DRJ 518.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">24.    There are two different sets of appeals in this batch. The first batch of\nappeals are those in which the order dated 1st December, 2016 was passed in\nrespect of the same work orders. The second set of appeals arises out of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">RFA 573/2017                                                        Page 19 of 47</span>\n different work orders, though sometimes the Contractors are the same. To\nthe extent the appeals relate to the same work order, the parties shall be\nbound by the 1st December, 2016 order. However, the said order cannot\napply in the second set of cases as the transactions are completely separate\nand distinct. The appeals arise out of completely different suits. Consent\nterms of different proceedings and transactions cannot be imposed.\nMoreover, even insofar as the first set of appeals are concerned, Contractors\nhave pressed for the relief of interest on Principal amounts. Order Nos.1 to 4\ndo not constitute precedents as they were based on the initial consent order\nwhich stood modified/merged in the orders passed by the Supreme Court.\nThe question of consent was also left open by the Supreme Court for being\nre-agitated. Hence, the legal and factual issues in these appeals have to be\nadjudicated on their own merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">Questions\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">25.    The questions, therefore, that arise in this appeal and all the connected\nappeals are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">       (i)     Whether payment of the principal amount can be delayed in\n       view of Clause 7 and Clause 9 of the General Conditions of Contract\n       read with the amendments?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">       (ii)    Whether the refund of earnest money/security deposit can be\n       delayed in view of Clauses 17 and 45 of the General Conditions of\n       Contract?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">       (iii)   Whether interest is payable on delayed payments/refunds and if\n       so, for which period?\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">RFA 573/2017                                                        Page 20 of 47</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\"> Question No. 1- Payment of Principal amount\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">26.    Whenever tenders are called for and work orders are placed by the\nCorporation, all Contractors are bound by the General Conditions of\nContract. The said conditions are published by the Corporations and are\n&quot;Standard Form&quot;. No deviation is usually permissible from the said General\nConditions of Contract. Registered Contractors are aware of the General\nConditions of Contract and apply for the tenders accordingly. They also\nexecute the work orders, fully conscious of the General Conditions of\nContract. However, the question that arises is whether the two clauses\nrelating to non-payment of bills indefinitely, though the bills are passed by\nthe Executive Engineer and non-payment of interest for delayed payment,\nwould be legal and valid?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">Clauses relied upon\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">27.    The Corporations rely on Clauses 7 and 9 of the General Conditions\nof Contract, so do the Contractors. There are however, different versions of\nthe said clauses, especially Clause 9. The work orders have been awarded\npost-2008. There is actually no clarity as to which version of the clause was\napplicable during which period and hence the latest clause is being applied\nuniformly in all cases. The Clauses relied upon by the Corporation are\nClauses 7 and 9 of the General Conditions of Contract, which are\nreproduced below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">           &quot;CLAUSE 7\n           Payment on Intermediate Certificate to be Regarded\n           as Advances:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">              No payment shall be made for work estimated to\n           cost Rs.

Clause 7 of the General Conditions of Contract deals with the\npayment on the basis of intermediate certificates as advance payments and\nClause 9 of the General Conditions of Contract relates to payment of final\nbills. In both cases, the Engineer-in-Charge has to certify the payments. So\nfar there can be no issue. Obviously if payments have to be made to\nContractors, the Engineer-in-Charge who is getting the work done has to\ncertify that the work has actually been done on site and the material etc. for\nwhich payment is being executed has been duly employed in the works.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">33.    However, the quandary for the Contractor begins after the bills are\npassed by the Engineer-in-Charge. Clause 7 provides that the amount so\ncertified shall be paid by the 30th working day after the presentation of the\nbill by the Contractor. However, thereafter comes the big caveat i.e. that the\nCorporation should have funds available with it under the specific head of\naccount.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">34.    It is slightly unfathomable as to how the Corporation can postpone the\npayment to the Contractor, indefinitely. The issuance of the tender and the\nwork order in favour of the Contractor has to be on the pre-condition that\nfunds are available with the Corporation. To ask the Contractor to wait\nendlessly for his payment is wholly arbitrary. The Corporation which hands\nover the works contract to the Contractor cannot say &quot;Do the work now, I\nwill pay when I have the money&quot;. Even if such a clause has been signed and\naccepted by the Contractor, it does not make the clause valid inasmuch as it\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">RFA 573/2017                                                        Page 27 of 47</span>\n would render a fundamental condition of contract being hit by provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_7\">Indian Contract Act, 1872</a> (hereinafter, „<a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_8\">Contract Act</a>‟).

In cases where tendered value of\n           the work is upto Rs.5 lakhs, payment is required to be\n           made within three months and where the tendered\n           value of the work exceeds Rs.5 lakhs, the payment is to\n           be made within six months. Learned counsel for the\n           defendant submitted that the contract uses the\n           expression &quot;as far as possible&quot;. This expression to my\n           mind supports the case of the Plaintiffs. The expression\n           &quot;as far as possible&quot; is a pointer that every endeavor\n           should be made by MCD to make payment within the\n           time period stipulated in Clause 9. Normally and in\n           due course, payments will be made within the time limit\n           mentioned. The applications filed for leave to defend\n           do not set out and give any reason for the delay in\n           making the payments. Normally, payment should be\n           made within a reasonable time after the contract has\n           been executed and the party has performed his\n           obligations under the contract. <a href=\"/doc/1403481/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 46</a> of the Indian\n           Contract Act, 1872 stipulates that where no time limit\n           is specified, the engagement must be performed within\n           a reasonable time.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">           8. In the applications for leave to defend, it is stated\n           that payments will be made as and when funds in a\n           particular budget head are available with the MCD. Ex\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">RFA 573/2017                                                      Page 28 of 47</span>\n            facie, the stand taken in the leave to defend\n           applications cannot be accepted and has to be rejected.\n           Once the defendant-MCD admits its obligation to make\n           payment, the said payment has to be arranged for and\n           budgeted for by them. The plaintiffs have no role to\n           play in the said exercise. How the defendant manages\n           their internal affairs is their own business. In fact,\n           Clause 9 of the Contract stipulates that &quot;as far as\n           possible the MCD will make endeavor to make the\n           payment within the said period&quot;.....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">35.

This Court\ncategorically rejected this stand of the Corporation by holding &quot;Ex facie, the\nstand taken in the leave to defend applications cannot be accepted and has\nto be rejected&quot;.

While the Contractors have argued that they have an unequal\nbargaining power with the Corporation, the Corporation argues that these are\ncommercial contracts and the Contractor has signed the contract with open\neyes. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"477313\" id=\"span_58\">In <a href=\"/doc/477313/\" id=\"a_17\">Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited and Anr. v.\nBrojo Nath Ganguly and Anr.</a> (1986) 3 SCC 156, the Supreme Court held:</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">RFA 573/2017                                                        Page 31 of 47</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">            &quot;89. ....The principle deducible from the above\n           discussions on this part of the case is in consonance\n           with right and reason, intended to secure social and\n           economic justice and conforms to the mandate of the\n           great equality clause in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 14.</a> This principle is\n           that the courts will not enforce and will, when called\n           upon to do so, strike down an unfair and unreasonable\n           contract, or an unfair and unreasonable clause in a\n           contract, entered into between parties who are not\n           equal in bargaining power. It is difficult to give an\n           exhaustive list of all bargains of this type. No court can\n           visualize the different situations which can arise in the\n           affairs of men. One can only attempt to give some\n           illustrations. For instance, the above principle will\n           apply where the inequality of bargaining power is the\n           result of the great disparity in the economic strength of\n           the contracting parties. It will apply where the\n           inequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the\n           creation of the parties or not. It will apply to situations\n           in which the weaker party is in a position in which he\n           can obtain goods or services or means of livelihood\n           only upon the terms imposed by the stronger party or\n           go without them. It will also apply where a man has no\n           choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his\n           assent to a contract or to sign on the dotted line in a\n           prescribed or standard form or to accept a set of rules\n           as part of the contract, however unfair, unreasonable\n           and unconscionable a clause in that contract or form\n           or rules may be. This principle, however, will not apply\n           where the bargaining power of the contracting parties\n           is equal or almost equal. This principle may not apply\n           where both parties are businessmen and the contract is\n           a commercial transaction. In today&#x27;s complex world of\n           giant corporations with their vast infra-structural\n           organizations and with the State through its\n           instrumentalities and agencies entering into almost\n           every branch of industry and commerce, there can be\n           myriad situations which result in unfair and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">RFA 573/2017                                                         Page 32 of 47</span>\n            unreasonable bargains between parties possessing\n           wholly disproportionate and unequal bargaining\n           power.

Is a contract of the type mentioned above to be\n           adjudged voidable or void? If it was induced by undue\n           influence, then under <a href=\"/doc/1045643/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 19A</a> of the Indian\n           Contract Act, it would be voidable. It is, however,\n           rarely that contracts of the types to which the principle\n           formulated by us above applies are induced by undue\n           influence as defined by <a href=\"/doc/1241481/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 16(1)</a> of the Indian\n           Contract Act, even though at times they are between\n           parties one of whom holds a real or apparent authority\n           over the other. In the vast majority of cases, however,\n           such contracts are entered into by the weaker party\n           under pressure of circumstances, generally economic,\n           which results in inequality of bargaining power. Such\n           contracts will not fall within the four corners of the\n           definition of &quot;undue influence&quot; given in <a href=\"/doc/1241481/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 16(1)</a>.\n           Further, the majority of such contracts are in a\n           standard or prescribed form or consist of a set of rules.\n           They are not contracts between individuals containing\n           terms meant for those individuals alone. Contracts in\n           prescribed or standard forms or which embody a set of\n           rules as part of the contract are entered into by the\n           party with superior bargaining power with a large\n           number of persons who have far less bargaining power\n           or no bargaining power at all. Such contracts which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">RFA 573/2017                                                       Page 33 of 47</span>\n            affect a large number of persons or a group or groups\n           of persons, if they are unconscionable, unfair and\n           unreasonable, are injurious to the public interest. To\n           say that such a contract is only voidable would be to\n           compel each person with whom the party with superior\n           bargaining power had contracted to go to court to\n           have the contract adjudged voidable. This would only\n           result in multiplicity of litigation which no court should\n           encourage and would also not be in the public interest.\n           Such a contract or such a clause in a contract ought,\n           therefore, to be adjudged void. While the law of\n           contracts in England is mostly judge-made, the law of\n           contracts in India is enacted in a statute, namely, the\n           <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_23\">Indian Contract Act, 1872</a>.

The only\n           relevant provision in the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_25\">Indian Contract Act</a> which\n           can apply is <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 23</a> when it states that &quot;The\n           consideration or object of an agreement is lawful,\n           unless . . . the court regards it as . . . opposed to public\n           policy.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">           92 . <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_27\">The Indian Contract Act</a> does not define the\n           expression &quot;public policy&quot; or &quot;opposed to public\n           policy&quot;. From the very nature of things, the expressions\n           &quot;public policy&quot;, &quot;opposed to public policy&quot; or\n           &quot;contrary to public policy&quot; are incapable of precise\n           definition. Public policy, however, is not the policy of a\n           particular government. It connotes some matter which\n           concerns the public good and the public interest.

As new concepts take the place of old,\n           transactions which were once considered against\n           public policy are now being upheld by the courts and\n           similarly where there has been a well recognized head\n           of public policy, the courts have not shirked from\n           extending it to new transactions and changed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">RFA 573/2017                                                          Page 34 of 47</span>\n            circumstances and have at times not even flinched from\n           inventing a new head of public policy. There are two\n           schools of thought - &quot;the narrow view&quot; school and &quot;the\n           broad view&quot; school. According to the former, courts\n           can not create new heads of public policy whereas the\n           latter countenances judicial law-making in this area.\n           The adherents of &quot;the narrow view&quot; school would not\n           invalidate a contract on the ground of public policy\n           unless that particular ground had been well-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">           established by authorities.....

Practices which were\n           considered perfectly normal at one time have today\n           become obnoxious and oppressive to public\n           conscience. If there is no head of public policy which\n           covers a case, then the court must in consonance with\n           public conscience and in keeping with public good and\n           public interest declare such practice to be opposed to\n           public policy. Above all, in deciding any case which\n           may not be covered by authority our courts have before\n           them the beacon light of the Preamble to the\n           Constitution.

The question therefore would be as to whether the Court in this case\nshould take a narrow view or a broad view. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"477313\" id=\"span_65\">In <a href=\"/doc/477313/\" id=\"a_29\">Brojo Nath Ganguly and\nAnr.</a> (supra), the Supreme Court clearly held that:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">           &quot;The types of contracts to which the principle\n           formulated by us above applies are not contracts which\n           are tainted with illegality but are contracts which\n           contain terms which are so unfair and unreasonable\n           that they shock the conscience of the court.

Thus, the argument of `unequal bargaining power&#x27; may not apply in\ncommercial contracts of the kind, which are the subject matter of the present\nappeal.

In the present case, the combined effect of the Clauses and the\nCircular and amendments, set out above, is that if the Corporation does not\nprocure funds, it is not liable to even pay the Contractor any interest and the\nContractor has no remedy. This by itself would mean that such a Clause\ncould be read as leading to a contract without consideration and hence\nunlawful under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. The Corporation being an\ninstrumentality of State, such a contract would also be opposed to public\npolicy under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. <a href=\"/doc/1403481/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 46</a> of the Contract Act\nis also clear that if no time for performance of a contract is specified, it has\nto be performed within a reasonable time. Reading these provisions\ntogether, it is clear that an open ended Clause which in effect says that the\npayment shall be made at an undetermined time in the future, subject to\navailability of funds, in a particular head of accounts is wholly unreasonable\nand such a term would also be unfair.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">45.    It is equally strange that the Corporation seeks to justify the non-\npayment on the ground of non-availability of funds for medicines or hospital\nitems or pensions or salaries of the Corporation.

The question arose as to whether the time\nprescribed for making the payment of balance consideration was reasonable.\nThe Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court, following the dicta of Justice\nWarrington in Watling v. Lewis 1911 1 Ch. 414, held the balance sum ought\nto be paid within a reasonable time in view of <a href=\"/doc/1403481/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 46</a> of the Contract\nAct.

While\n           construing the disputed contract embodied in the sale\n           deed, the real covenant cannot be so construed that an\n           absolute obligation arising under it can be allowed to\n           be destroyed by a subsequent clause contained in the\n           same deed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338374\" id=\"span_73\">In re <a href=\"/doc/338374/\" id=\"a_40\">Tewkesbury Gas Company Tysoe v.\n           The Company</a> 1911 2 Ch.279, a company had issued a\n           series of debentures each of which contained a\n           covenant by the company that it would &#x27;on or after&#x27;\n           January 1, 1898, pay to&#x27; the registered holder of the\n           debenture the principal sum thereby secured.

The\nCourt, however, held that what is reasonable is a question of fact. The\nobservation of the Supreme Court reads as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">           &quot;25. It was contended on behalf of Mundhra that he\n           was always ready and willing to pay the purchase\n           money but since the decree did not specify any time for\n           payment of the money, there was no default on his part.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">RFA 573/2017                                                        Page 40 of 47</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">            In other words, the contention was that since the\n           decree did not specify a time within which the purchase\n           money should be paid and, since an application for\n           fixing the time was made by the appellant and\n           dismissed by the Court, Mundhra cannot be said to\n           have been in default in not paying the purchase money\n           so that the appellant might apply for rescission of the\n           decree. If a contract does not specify the time for\n           performance, the Law will limply that the parties\n           intended that the obligation under the contract should\n           be performed within a reasonable time. <a href=\"/doc/1403481/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 46</a> of\n           the Contract Act provides that where, by a contract a\n           promissory is to perform his promise without\n           application by the promisee and no time for\n           performance is specified, the engagement must be\n           performed within a reasonable time and the question\n           &quot;what is reasonable time&quot; is, in each particular case,\n           a question of fact. We have already indicated that the\n           contract between the parties was not extinguished by\n           the passing of the decree, that it subsisted\n           notwithstanding the decree. It was an implied term of\n           the contract and, therefore, of the decree passed\n           thereon that the parties would perform the contract\n           within a reasonable time. To put it in other words, as\n           the contract subsisted despite the decree and as the\n           decree did not abrogate or modify any of the express or\n           implied term of the contract, it must be presumed that\n           the parties to the decree had the obligation to complete\n           the contract within a reasonable time.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"492534\" id=\"span_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1767393\" id=\"span_78\">48.

Ltd.</a>\n(2011) 10 SCC 420 (hereinafter, „Cauvery Coffee Traders‟) to argue that\nContractors cannot approbate and reprobate. Since Contractors wanted to\nobtain benefits under the work order and the terms of the work order\n(including the General Conditions of Contract) were well known to them,\nthey cannot then argue that &quot;I want the work order but without clause 7 &amp;\n9&quot;. This argument would have been acceptable and appealing if the Clause\nunder the contract had some reasonable time limit fixed for the payment to\nbe made, while following a queue system. However, the Corporation argues\nthat there is no time limit fixed at all. There are too many contingencies and\nconditions that are stipulated in order to make payment, namely:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">               (i) funds should be available with the Corporation;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">               (ii) funds should be available under specific head;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">               (iii) the Contractors&#x27; turn to be paid should arise; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">               (iv) Interest would not be paid for the delayed period.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">50.    These four conditions are so vague and ambiguous into the future that\nat no point would a Contractor, who had executed the work order, be able to\ndemand payment. On the one hand, the Contractor is expected to obtain all\nthe construction material at his own expenses, employ labour at his own\nexpenses and execute the work order. Thereafter, he has to submit his bills\nto the Corporation and the Engineer-in-Charge has to pass the said bills. So\nfar, the conditions are reasonable. However, to say that even after the bills\nare passed the payment would be made if and when the funds are available,\nif and when Contractor&#x27;s turn comes, is in effect to say that it would make\nthe payment in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years or not pay at all. Such a condition in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">RFA 573/2017                                                          Page 42 of 47</span>\n any contract would be illegal, unconscionable and unreasonable. There is no\nquestion of estoppel by election in such a case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1917378\" id=\"span_82\">In <a href=\"/doc/1917378/\" id=\"a_49\">Cauvery Coffee Traders</a>\n(supra) the Supreme Court&#x27;s observation on approbate and reprobate was in\nthe context of a transaction that stood concluded `after extensive and\nexhaustive bilateral deliberations&#x27;. The position in the present cases is the\nopposite. Here it is a standard form contract which is to be accepted without\nmuch choice. The only choice before a Contractor is simply to not to apply\nfor or accept the work order itself. Thus, the authority cited on this\nproposition would not apply.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178717\" id=\"span_83\">51.

State of Bihar</a> (1981) 1 SCC 537 to submit that once a party\nhas accepted the terms of the contract and takes the advantage of the terms\nwhich are in his favour, he cannot then repudiate the other parts of the\ncontract. This is again a general principle. The payment of consideration\ngoes to the root of a contract. Without consideration, there is no valid\ncontract. The contractor, apart from having the work orders placed on him,\nand making the deposit of the earnest money/security amount has executed\nthe contract after making his own expenditure in terms of the material used\nand the payments to labour and other overheads. Under the contract entered\ninto with the Corporation apart from placing of the work order and hoping of\nclearance of the final bills, there is no other term of which the other\nContractor has taken advantage of. Any term of the contract has to be\nconstrued within the four corners of law. A term in a contract which is\ncontrary to law has to be interpreted as per the applicable provisions. In that\nsense, there is no repudiation by the Contractor.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">RFA 573/2017                                                       Page 43 of 47</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"215897\" id=\"span_85\">52.

Even in <a href=\"/doc/215897/\" id=\"a_52\">the said judgment</a> the\nSupreme Court holds:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">           &quot;13. The word &quot;reasonable&quot; has in law prima facie\n           meaning of reasonable in regard to those\n           circumstances of which the person concerned is called\n           upon to act reasonably knows or ought to know as to\n           what was reasonable. It may be unreasonable to give\n           an exact definition of the word &quot;reasonable&quot;. The\n           reason varies in its conclusion according to\n           idiosyncrasy of the individual and the time and\n           circumstances in which he thinks. The dictionary\n           meaning of the &quot;reasonable time&quot; is to be so much time\n           as is necessary, under the circumstances, to do\n           conveniently what the contract or duty requires should\n           be done in a particular case. In other words it means\n           as soon as circumstances permit. In Law Lexicon it is\n           defined to mean:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">              &quot;A reasonable time, looking at all the\n              circumstances of the case; a reasonable time\n              under ordinary circumstances; as soon as\n              circumstances will permit; so much time as is\n              necessary under the circumstances, conveniently\n              to do what the contract requires should be done;\n              some more protracted space than &#x27;directly&#x27;; such\n              length of time as may fairly, and properly, and\n              reasonably be allowed or required, having regard\n              to the nature of the act or duty and to the\n              attending circumstances; all these convey more or\n              less the same idea.&quot;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">Thus, the reasonableness has to be seen from the facts of each case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">53.    A harmonious interpretation of the Clauses in the General Conditions\nof Contract and the amendment of 2006, has to be made, failing which, the\nClauses would be contrary to law and to the basic principles of valid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">RFA 573/2017                                                     Page 44 of 47</span>\n contracts. An indefinite open ended Clause for making payment would be\nunreasonable and hence contrary to <a href=\"/doc/1403481/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 46</a> of the Contract Act. Reading\nthe contract as a whole with the amendment of May, 2006, it is clear that\ninsofar as payment under Clause 9 of the General Conditions of Contract is\nconcerned, the Corporation itself specifies the time for payment of the final\nbills as 6 months and 9 months. Thus, the contract itself considers and\nspecifies the reasonable time. However, the same is sought to be diluted by\nspecifying that this period shall be adhered to `as far as possible&#x27;. The queue\nsystem and availability of funds are deemed by the Corporation to override\nthe 6 months and 9 months period. There is no reason as to why the court\nshould consider that the intention was to prescribe no upper limit for making\nof payment and leave the period for payment as an open ended one.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">Order XII Rule 6\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">54.    Further reliance has also been placed on a number of orders in respect\nof Order XII Rule 6 and as to when a decree on admission can be passed. In\nthe present case, no oral evidence is actually required to be adduced. The\nawarding of the contract is not disputed. The execution of the contract is not\ndisputed. The final bill having been passed by the Engineer-in-Charge is not\ndisputed. What is disputed is the time when the payment is to be made. This\nis only a matter of interpretation of the Clauses of the General Conditions of\nContract. In cases where there are factual disputes, evidence can be led to\nadjudicate those facts. However, in the present cases, there being no factual\ndispute and only a question of application of the Clauses of the General\nConditions of Contract and their interpretation is involved, the approach of\nthe Trial Court in applying <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_54\">Order XII Rule 6 of the CPC</a> cannot be faulted.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">RFA 573/2017                                                       Page 45 of 47</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\"> 55.    It is the settled position in law, even in the authorities cited by the\nCorporation that when the pleadings are clear, they constitute admission. A\nreading of the written statement shows that the Corporation does not\nseriously dispute the passing of the final bills and the amount of Security\ndeposited. Only the interest component is seriously disputed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144748127\" id=\"span_88\">56.    As per <a href=\"/doc/144748127/\" id=\"a_55\">Himani Alloys Ltd. v.

In the light of the\nstand in the written statement, there is a clear admission as to the final bill\namount as also that the Contractor has to wait in a queue.

The Trial Court, thus, decreed the suit under Order XII Rule 6, in\nrespect of the admitted principal amount. Insofar as the refund of the\nsecurity amount, etc is concerned, the Trial Court left the same to be\nadjudicated after trial. By this appeal, order dated 24th January, 2017, which\ncame to be passed in the application filed by the Contractor under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_57\">Order XII\nRule 6 of the CPC</a>, has been challenged. The suit is, however, still pending\nin respect of the other issues including refund of security amount, payment\nof interest etc., From a perusal of the trial court record, it appears that during\nthe pendency of the appeal, payments towards two work orders have already\nbeen made. So the decree is being modified to the said extent. Further the\nCorporation has contended that there has been a delay in the execution of the\nwork orders. Thus the decree is being granted only qua the admitted\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">RFA 573/2017                                                         Page 46 of 47</span>\n amounts.
