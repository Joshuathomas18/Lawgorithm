The appellant, in order to\n\nfacilitate timely execution of the project, appointed respondent\n\nNo.1 as subcontractor on 04.06.2020. In addition to the said\n\nproject, the appellant was also awarded several contracts for\n\nimprovement of roads in Amravati and Maharashtra and the\n\nappellant-company        entered        into       various    contracts      with   the\n\nrespondent No.1 for procurement of materials and equipments\n\nand all other works and things necessary for completion of\n\nconstruction works.

The\n\nappellant    and     respondent        No.1       entered          into   reworks   and\n\nrectification agreement on 23.02.2021 to carry out detailed\n\nreworking and rectification works.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">            It appears that the appellant felt that the works\n\nexecuted by the respondent No.1 were riddled with issues and in\n\nbreach of the agreed parameters and specifications due to which\n\nthe overall progress of both the projects suffered tremendously.\n\nThe appellant wrote a letter dated 24.03.2022 to the respondent\n\nNo.1 complaining about the deficiencies in the construction work\n\ncarried out by it while reserving its right to take appropriate action\n\nagainst the respondent No.1 in respect of respective contracts.\n\nThe appellant has invoked 14 bank guarantees furnished by the\n\nrespondent No.1 under the projects, however, out of those 14\n\nbank guarantees, 9 have been duly encashed, but due to the\n\nimpugned order passed by the trial court remaining could not be\n\nencashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">            After receiving of the letter dated 24.03.2022, the\n\nrespondent No.1 filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 9</a> of the Act of\n\n1996 and as observed earlier, the trial court registered the said\n\napplication and passed an ex parte ad interim stay order\n\nrestraining the appellant from encashing the five bank guarantees,\n\nmentioned in the impugned order while summoning the appellant\n\nand respondent No.2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">            The appellant challenged the said order mainly on the\n\nground that the trial court has no jurisdiction to entertain the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                       (Downloaded on 30/03/2023 at 12:01:46 AM)</span>\n [2023/RJJD/006679]                   (4 of 35)                       [CMA-488/2022]\n\n\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 9</a> of the Act of 1996 preferred by the\n\nrespondent No.1 and, therefore, the impugned order passed by\n\nthe trial court is liable to be set aside.

However, ultimately the\n\ntrial court decided the objections filed by the appellant regarding\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction on 22.05.2022 and dismissed the said\n\nobjection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">             Be that as it may, we are of the opinion that the\n\nquestion regarding the maintainability of application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n\n9</a> of the Act of 1996 before the trial court still survives and,\n\ntherefore, we have heard the learned counsel for the parties with\n\nintention to decide the said question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">             Learned counsel appearing for the respondents has\n\nraised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of this\n\nappeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">             Mr. V.Giri, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr K.Goswami\n\nhas argued that the order impugned is an interlocutory order and\n\nagainst the said order, no appeal shall lie before this Court under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/44411053/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 13</a> of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (for short &#x27;the Act\n\nof 2015&#x27; hereinafter) or under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 37</a> of the Act of 1996.

It is submitted that though such interlocutory\n\norders passed by the commercial court can be challenged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 13</a> of the Act of 2015, however, as per provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 13</a>, an appeal can lie against only such orders passed by a\n\ncommercial court which are specifically enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_14\">Order\n\nXLIII of the CPC</a> and under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 37</a> of the Act of 1996.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">            It is submitted that under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 37</a> of the Act of\n\n1996, an appeal shall lie against three categories of orders, which\n\nare enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/592315/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 37(1) (a)</a>, (b) and (c).

It   is    further      submitted         that    the   order\n\nimpugned is an interlocutory order and certainly against the said\n\norder, no appeal under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 37</a> of the Act of 1996 would lie.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"38694229\" id=\"span_5\">Mr Giri has placed reliance on a decision of Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court rendered in Owners and Parties Interested in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/38694229/\" id=\"a_21\">Vessel M.V.

After\n                considering the facts involved in the said\n                case and the submissions made on\n                behalf of the parties, this Court observed\n                as                                  follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                Thus it is now a settled principle that\n                where there may be two or more\n                competent Courts which can entertain a\n                suit consequent upon a part of the cause\n                of action having arisen there within, if\n                the parties to the contract agreed to vest\n                jurisdiction in one such Court to try the\n                dispute which might arise as between\n                themselves, the agreement would be\n                valid.

In the instant case, the appellant does not\n            dispute that part of cause of action has arisen in\n            Kolkata. What appellant says is that part of cause\n            of action has also arisen in Jaipur and, therefore,\n            Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court or the\n            designate Judge has jurisdiction to consider the\n            application   made       by    the     appellant     for    the\n            appointment of an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 11</a>.\n            Having regard to <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 11(12)(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/85567/\" id=\"a_161\">Section\n            2(e)</a> of the 1996 Act read with <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 20(c)</a> of the\n            Code, there remains no doubt that the Chief\n            Justice or the designate Judge of the Rajasthan\n            High Court has jurisdiction in the matter. The\n            question is, whether parties by virtue of clause 18\n            of the agreement have agreed to exclude the\n            jurisdiction of the courts at Jaipur or, in other\n            words, whether in view of clause 18 of the\n            agreement, the jurisdiction of Chief Justice of the\n            Rajasthan High Court has been excluded?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">            32. For answer to the above question, we have to\n            see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the\n            agreement which provides that the agreement\n            shall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                     (Downloaded on 30/03/2023 at 12:01:47 AM)</span>\n [2023/RJJD/006679]                       (28 of 35)                         [CMA-488/2022]\n\n\n            Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for\n            jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like\n            &#x27;alone&#x27;, &#x27;only&#x27;, &#x27;exclusive&#x27; or &#x27;exclusive jurisdiction&#x27;\n            have not been used but this, in our view, is not\n            decisive      and     does       not      make    any     material\n            difference. The intention of the parties - by having\n            clause 18 in the agreement - is clear and\n            unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have\n            jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata\n            alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for\n            construction of jurisdiction clause, like clause 18 in\n            the agreement, the maxim expressio unius est\n            exclusio alterius comes into play as there is\n            nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal\n            maxim means that expression of one is the\n            exclusion of another. By making a provision that\n            the agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the\n            courts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly\n            excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where\n            the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts\n            at   a     particular    place     and     such     courts      have\n            jurisdiction to deal with the matter, we think that\n            an inference may be drawn that parties intended\n            to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not\n            hit by <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act at all. Such\n            clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is against\n            the public policy. It does not offend <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 28</a> of\n            the Contract Act in any manner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">            37. In my opinion, the very existence of the\n            exclusion of jurisdiction clause in the agreement\n            would be rendered meaningless were it not given\n            its natural and plain meaning. The use of words\n            like &quot;only&quot;, &quot;exclusively&quot;, &quot;alone&quot; and so on are not\n            necessary to convey the intention of the parties in\n            an       exclusion      of    jurisdiction       clause    of    an\n            agreement. Therefore, I agree with the conclusion\n            that jurisdiction in the subject matter of the\n            proceedings vested, by agreement, only in the\n            Courts in Kolkata.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                         (Downloaded on 30/03/2023 at 12:01:47 AM)</span>\n [2023/RJJD/006679]                   (29 of 35)                          [CMA-488/2022]\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">            57. For the reasons mentioned above, I agree with\n            my learned Brother that in the jurisdiction clause\n            of an agreement, the absence of words like\n            &quot;alone&quot;,     &quot;only&quot;,       &quot;exclusive&quot;         or       &quot;exclusive\n            jurisdiction&quot; is neither decisive nor does it make\n            any material difference in deciding the jurisdiction\n            of a court. The very existence of a jurisdiction\n            clause in an agreement makes the intention of the\n            parties to an agreement quite clear and it is not\n            advisable to read such a clause in the agreement\n            like a statute. In the present case, only the Courts\n            in   Kolkata    had     jurisdiction      to    entertain     the\n            disputes between the parties.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167480063\" id=\"span_58\">In <a href=\"/doc/167480063/\" id=\"a_165\">Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. vs. Girdhar\n\nSondhi</a> (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">            &quot;8.

On the facts\n           of the present case, it is clear that the seat of\n           arbitration is Mumbai and Clause 19 further makes it\n           clear that jurisdiction exclusively vests in the Mumbai\n           courts.

The neutral venue may not in the\n           classical sense have jurisdiction - that is, no part of\n           the cause of action may have arisen at the neutral\n           venue and neither would any of the provisions of\n           <a href=\"/doc/169730061/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 16</a> to <a href=\"/doc/51447063/\" id=\"a_190\">21</a> of the CPC be attracted. In\n           arbitration law however, as has been held above, the\n           moment &quot;seat&quot; is determined, the fact that the seat\n           is   at   Mumbai      would      vest    Mumbai          courts    with\n           exclusive    jurisdiction      for    purposes       of    regulating\n           arbitral proceedings arising out of the agreement\n           between the parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23112747\" id=\"span_74\">21.
