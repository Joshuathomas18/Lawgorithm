It   is   settled   principle   that   an   Appellate   Court   has \n\n\n\nfull power to review, re-appreciate and reconsider the evidence \n\n\n\nupon   which   the   order   of   acquittal   is   founded.     The   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_33\">Code   of \n\n\n\nCriminal   Procedure</a>   (in   short   `<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_34\">Cr.P.C</a>&#x27;)   puts   no   limitation, \n\n\n\nrestriction   or   condition   on   exercise   of   such   power   and   an \n\n\n\nAppellate   Court   is   free   to   arrive   at   such   conclusion,   both   on \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     11</span>\n\n\f\nquestions   of   fact   and   of   law.     An   Appellate   Court,   however, \n\n\n\nmust   bear   in   mind   that   in   case   of   acquittal,   there   is   double \n\n\n\npresumption   in   favour   of   the   accused.     The   presumption   of \n\n\n\ninnocence   is   available   to   a   person   and   in   the   criminal \n\n\n\njurisprudence   that   every   person   shall   be   presumed   to   be \n\n\n\ninnocent   unless   he   is   proved   guilty   by   a   competent   court   of \n\n\n\nlaw.

The   tender   of   Shri   Alexander \n\n\n\nVellappally   was   qualified   and   the   lowest   when   it   was \n\n\n\nevaluated.

According to him, though he was the \n\n\n\nlowest tenderer, the work was not awarded to him, but given to \n\n\n\nHCC.

It  is relevant to note  that \n\n\n\nR. Balakrishna Pillai (A1) was the Minister for Electricity from \n\n\n\n27.01.1980   to   21.10.1981,   26.05.1982   to   05.06.1985   and \n\n\n\n25.05.1986   to   25.03.1987.     The   tender   for   surge   shaft   was \n\n\n\ninvited   and   awarded   to   one   E.M.   Varkey   at   21%   below \n\n\n\nestimated rate.   The estimated rate was Rs 74 lakhs for surge \n\n\n\nshaft.   However, the work was abandoned on 28.03.1981 due \n\n\n\nto labour strike.  Thereafter, tenders were invited again for the \n\n\n\nsurge   shaft   and   four   persons   submitted   their   offers   for \n\n\n\ntenders.     The   lowest   rate   was   quoted   by   M/s   We-Build   Pvt. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">Ltd. and the next lowest rate was by E.M. Varkey at 57% above \n\n\n\nPAC.  It is pointed out that though the work was recommended \n\n\n\nto   be   awarded,   the   Board   decided   to   re-tender   the   work. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">Accordingly, the tenders were invited  again and E. M. Varkey \n\n\n\nalone quoted for the work.   His tender was not accepted since \n\n\n\nhe quoted exorbitant rate.  In the meanwhile, pre-qualification \n\n\n\nbid system was introduced in the Board which is evident from \n\n\n\nExt.   P-576   dated   24.09.1981,   which   was   made   applicable   to \n\n\n\nIdamalayar   contract   works.     Thereafter,   tender   for   both   the \n\n\n\nworks were invited by Shri Bharathan, the then Chief Engineer \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                  17</span>\n\n\f\nwhich   is  evident   from   Ext.  P-46  dated  05.06.1981.    However, \n\n\n\nthe tender was cancelled by him which is also clear from Ext \n\n\n\nP-47   dated   22.10.1981.     The   Chief   Engineer   extended   the \n\n\n\nvalidity   of   the   tender   upto   29.04.1982   and   after   his   demise, \n\n\n\nthe   then   Chief   Engineer   (PW-7)   extended   the   validity   upto \n\n\n\n30.06.1982. During that time, two tenders were received, one \n\n\n\nby   K.P.Poulose   and   other   by   Kuriakose   Chennakkadan   (PW-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_32\">64),   quoting   special   conditions.     The   cover   containing   the \n\n\n\nconditions   and   deviations   was   opened   on   30.06.1982,   when \n\n\n\nK.P.Poulose   was   present   in   the   Board&#x27;s   Office.     However, \n\n\n\nKuriakose,   the   other   tenderer   was   not   informed   and   later   on \n\n\n\n09.09.1982, K.P.Poulose was pre-qualified and Kuriakose was \n\n\n\ndisqualified which, according to him, was without notice.  The \n\n\n\ncontract for the balance power tunnel and concrete lining work \n\n\n\nof Idamalayar works was ultimately awarded to K.P.Poulose at \n\n\n\n188%   of   the   above   estimated   rate   and   the   surge   shaft   work \n\n\n\nwas also awarded to him at 162% above the estimated rate. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">14)    It   is   clear   from   the   above   materials   that   the   process   of \n\n\n\ntendering   of   Idamalayar   works   was   interrupted   on   several \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                      18</span>\n\n\f\noccasions   mainly  by   the   Board  by  cancelling  the  tenders  and \n\n\n\nordering   re-tender   and   by   extending   the   period   of   validity   of \n\n\n\ntenders more than once.  It was on the last date of extension of \n\n\n\nthe   validity   of   the   tender   i.e.   on   30.06.1982,   K.P.Poulose \n\n\n\nappeared   and   submitted   his   tender   with   special   conditions \n\n\n\nwhich   was   later   accepted   in   the   Board&#x27;s   meeting   dated \n\n\n\n19.11.1982.     The   Special   Judge,   basing   reliance   on   Board&#x27;s \n\n\n\nresolution (Ex. P550(a)), has rightly concluded that there was \n\n\n\ninordinate   delay   in   awarding   the   work   which   reasoning   was \n\n\n\nnot accepted by the High Court.   The materials placed clearly \n\n\n\nshow   that   it   was   nearly   three   years   to   take   a   decision.     It   is \n\n\n\nalso clear from the evidence of PWs 64, 66, 138 and 146 which \n\n\n\nclingingly   established   the   circumstances   under   which   A1 \n\n\n\nconceived   the   idea   for   fixing   contract   of   the   Board   at \n\n\n\nexorbitant rate in order to derive monetary benefits.  From the \n\n\n\nabove,   the   contrary   conclusion   arrived   by   the   High   Court, \n\n\n\naccording  to  us,  is  not  in  terms of  the   evidence  led  in  by  the \n\n\n\nprosecution.             \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       19</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">Whether   Idamalayar   contract   was   awarded   at   exorbitant \n\n\nrate causing loss to the Board\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\">15)    The basic stand of the prosecution is that A1 entered into \n\n\n\ncriminal   conspiracy   to   award   the   disputed   contract   involving \n\n\n\nheavy   financial   gain   to   K.P.Poulose   (A4)   and   the   conspiracy \n\n\n\nand   abuse   of   power   by   certain   officials   enabled   the \n\n\n\nconspirators              to         earn         a               pecuniary             advantage              of \n\n\n\nRs.2,39,64,253/-,   in   addition   to   the   financial   loss   caused   to \n\n\n\nthe Board.   It is the specific case of the prosecution that rate \n\n\n\nawarded   in   both   the   contracts   is   exorbitant.     It   is   not   in \n\n\n\ndispute that the contract was awarded at 188% above PAC in \n\n\n\nthe   case   of   tunnel   work   and   162%   above   PAC   for   the   surge \n\n\n\nshaft   work.

On   the   other   hand,   the   accepted   tender \n\n\n\namount   as   per   the   award   of   contract   was   Rs.2,45,80,796/- \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">which is clear from Ext P 52.  It is further seen as per Ext P-68 \n\n\n\nagreement, the sanctioned estimate for surge shaft was Rs. 74 \n\n\n\nlakhs and it was awarded for Rs.1,42,94,901/-   The estimate \n\n\n\nfor   floor   concreting   was   Rs.479.5     per   M3    and   the   estimated \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                  20</span>\n\n\f\nrate for sides and arches was Rs.476.20 per M3.

Likewise,   the   rate   for   floor   concreting \n\n\n\nawarded   to   K.P.Poulose   was   Rs.825.47   per   M3.     In   fact,   the \n\n\n\ncalculations   made   by   PW-151   were   not  seriously   disputed   by \n\n\n\nthe defence. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">16)    In   order   to   appreciate   the   stand   that   the   estimated   rate \n\n\n\nand   the   tender   quoted   by   K.P.Poulose   was   exorbitant   was \n\n\n\ndemonstrated   by   Mr.   Shanti   Bhushan   by   taking   us   through \n\n\n\nthe   estimated   cost   of   the   work   awarded   to   skilled   workers \n\n\n\nbrought from Kulamavu and Moolamattom, who were awarded \n\n\n\nthe tunnel driving work on piece rate basis.

PW-156, the Investigating \n\n\n\nOfficer,   also   gave   evidence   on   the   basis   of   records   collected \n\n\n\nduring   his   investigation.     Ext.P-52   agreement   shows   that   the \n\n\n\nestimated   rate   for   driving   one   meter   tunnel   was   Rs.   4,090/-. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">Ext.

It   was   highlighted   that   when   the   total \n\n\n\nwork was done by the labourers at piece rate basis, they were \n\n\n\ngiven   Rs.   2,500/-   only   per   M3.     The   remuneration   for   24 \n\n\n\nmeters   driving   tunnel   would   come   to   only   Rs.60,000/-   the \n\n\n\ndifference i.e. Rs.1,79,961 (2,39,961-60,000) would show that \n\n\n\nthe   tunnel   driving   work   was   given   to   K.P.Poulose   (A4)   at   an \n\n\n\nexcessive rate.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">17)    It   is   pointed   out   that   there   is   enough   material   to   show \n\n\n\nthat the labourers, who did the tunnel work, were prepared to \n\n\n\ncarryout the balance work of the tunnel at the estimated rate \n\n\n\nof Rs. 4,090/-.  At the relevant time, the representatives of the \n\n\n\nworkers   made   a   representation   to   the   then   Minister   for \n\n\n\nElectricity,   namely,   R   Balakrishna   Pillai   (A1)   informing   him \n\n\n\nthat they are prepared to do the tunnel work and allied works \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                     22</span>\n\n\f\nat   the   estimated   rate.

In this regard, Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned \n\n\n\nsenior counsel appearing for the appellant heavily relied on the \n\n\n\nevidence of PW-46 who had gone to meet A1 along with (late) N \n\n\n\nSreekantan   Nair   and   submitted   a   Memorandum   Ext.P-287 \n\n\n\ndated   01.06.1982.     It   is   relevant   to   note   the   response   of   the \n\n\n\nMinister (A1) for the above said request. PW-46 stated that A1 \n\n\n\ntold them that there is no question of giving the works to the \n\n\n\nworkers   and   he   wants   to   give   the   work   to   K.P.Poulose.     This \n\n\n\ninstance   pointed   out   that   A1   had   personal   interest   in \n\n\n\nK.P.Poulose   and   had   decided   to   entrust   the   contract   to   him, \n\n\n\nthough   at  that  time,   the   said   K.P.Poulose   did   not  submit   the \n\n\n\ntender for the work.   We have already noted that K.P. Poulose \n\n\n\nsubmitted his tender only on 30.06.1982 i.e. a month after the \n\n\n\nmemorandum   dated   01.06.1982   submitted   by   PW-46.     In \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                     23</span>\n\n\f\nsupport of the same, the evidence of PW-122, T.M. Prabha, the \n\n\n\nthen   President   of   the   Kerala  Construction   Labour   Union   that \n\n\n\nhe met  A1 and  gave  representations  and requested  for  award \n\n\n\nof work to the workers at estimated rate and also absorption of \n\n\n\nthe workers in the Board&#x27;s service on permanent basis is also \n\n\n\nrelevant.     Here   again,   it   is   relevant   to   note   that   PW-122   was \n\n\n\nalso   informed   that   there   is   no   question   of   awarding   work   to \n\n\n\nworkers,   but   the   work   had   to   be   given   to   K.P.Poulose.   The \n\n\n\nevidence of PWs-46 and 122 and the statement made by A1 to \n\n\n\nboth of them clearly show that K.P. Poulose was the contractor \n\n\n\nchosen   in   advance   by   A1   and   other   accused   who   were   also \n\n\n\ninterested   in   him.     As   rightly   pointed   out   by   Mr.   Shanti \n\n\n\nBhushan,   this   evidence   should   be   connected   with   the \n\n\n\nconspiracy to award the work to K.P.Poulose at exorbitant rate \n\n\n\noriginated even prior to the submission of tenders to the work \n\n\n\nby K.P.Poulose and other tenderers.   The contrary conclusion \n\n\n\narrived at by the High Court justifying the award at higher rate \n\n\n\nto   K.P.Poulose   cannot   be   legally   sustained.     The   Board   is \n\n\n\nempowered   with   the   authority   to   award   contracts   and   has \n\n\n\ndiscretion to accept and being an authority constituted under \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                     24</span>\n\n\f\nthe Statute and a Pubic Undertaking is not expected to accept \n\n\n\ntenders at exorbitant rates with financial implications causing \n\n\n\nloss to the Board.  The Board is always expected to protect its \n\n\n\nfinancial interest while awarding contracts.  The Board mainly \n\n\n\nrelied   on   the   labour   problem   that   was   prevailing   at   the \n\n\n\nrelevant   time.     In   this   regard,   it   is   relevant   to   point   out   that \n\n\n\nthe tender for the Idamalayar work was invited in March, 1982 \n\n\n\nand   four   persons,   namely,   Kamalasanan   (PW-146),   Managing \n\n\n\nDirector,   We-Build,   C.K.   Verghese,   E.M.Varkey   and   V.A. \n\n\n\nThankachan   submitted   tenders   vide   Exts.   P78   series   dated \n\n\n\n21.03.1982.   It is true that the tunnel workers went on strike \n\n\n\non   20.04.1981   and   the   contractors   submitted   their   tenders \n\n\n\nwhen there was labour unrest.  However, the reason attributed \n\n\n\nfor the delay cannot be accepted.  As rightly pointed out, there \n\n\n\nwere   procedural   irregularities   and   omissions   by   the   Board \n\n\n\nauthorities in the manner of dealing with tenders submitted by \n\n\n\nK.P.Poulose   and   Kuriakose,   which   ultimately   eliminated \n\n\n\nKuriakose   from   the   scene,   keeping   K.P.Poulose   as   the   sole \n\n\n\ntenderer, qualified by pre-qualification Committee of the Board \n\n\n\nand hasty steps were taken by the Board in awarding contract \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                       25</span>\n\n\f\nin   favour   of   K.P.Poulose   in   the   meeting   held   on   19.11.1982 \n\n\n\nlead to the conclusion that the award of contract in favour of \n\n\n\nK.P.Poulose was an exorbitant one.   It is relevant to point out \n\n\n\nthat   the   Special   Judge,   by   adverting   to   Ext   550(a)   expressed \n\n\n\nthat the reasons stated by  the Board  in awarding  contract in \n\n\n\nfavour of K.P. Poulose at exorbitant rates are not acceptable.  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">No serious discussion by the Board\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">18)    It   is   pointed   out   and   in   fact   taken   us   through   evidence \n\n\n\nthat   there   was   no   serious   discussion   in   the   Board   meeting \n\n\n\nheld   on   19.11.1982   and   the   minutes   of   the   Meeting   were \n\n\n\nprepared as dictated by A7, the then Chairman of the Board. It \n\n\n\nis   the   responsibility   of   the   members,   more   particularly,   full \n\n\n\ntime   members   of   the   Board,   who   were   responsible   for   the \n\n\n\nscrutiny   of   the   deviations   and   conditions   suggested   by   the \n\n\n\ncontractor   which   involved   huge   financial   implications   to   see \n\n\n\nthat all transactions are beneficial to the Board and within the \n\n\n\npermissible   limit.     Mr.   Lalit   and   Mr.   Sharan,   learned   senior \n\n\n\ncounsel   appearing   for   A1   and   A3   respectively   heavily \n\n\n\ncontended   that   it   was   a   collective   decision   of   the   Board   and \n\n\n\nthere was no external pressure from anyone including A1.  It is \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                     26</span>\n\n\f\nrelevant   to   point   out   that   the   decision   ultimately   taken   for \n\n\n\nawarding   the   contract   with   special   conditions,   which   we   will \n\n\n\ndiscuss   in   the   later   paras,   as   suggested   by   the   contractor, \n\n\n\ninvolved huge financial implications at the risk and loss of the \n\n\n\nBoard.     Though  the   High  Court   has  concluded   that  the  part-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">time   members   who   were   signatory   to   Ex550(a)   had   approved \n\n\n\nthe   minutes,   subsequently,   the   Special   Court   made   a \n\n\n\ndistinction   between   the   responsibility   of   full-time   members \n\n\n\nand   that  of   part-time   members  in   the   matters   of  awarding   of \n\n\n\ncontract.     It   is   true   that   all   the   members   present   subscribed \n\n\n\ntheir   signature   in   the   minutes   in   awarding   contract   to \n\n\n\nK.P.Poulose.     It   was   highlighted   that   in   evidence,   A8,   the \n\n\n\nFinancial   Adviser   to   the   Board,   in   his   report   has   stated   that \n\n\n\nthe rates awarded to the contractor are very high.   The letters \n\n\n\nsent   by   A8   were   marked   as   Exs.   P-415   and   416.     It   is   also \n\n\n\nrelevant   to   point   out   that   the   then   Law   Secretary,   Shri \n\n\n\nViswanathan   Nair   also   conveyed   his   opinion   during   the \n\n\n\nmeeting   of   the   Board   that   the   rates   are   exorbitant.     These \n\n\n\naspects   were   taken   note   of   by   the   Special   Court   while \n\n\n\nconsidering the culpability of the accused and the High Court \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                     27</span>\n\n\f\nwas   not   serious   about   their   views.     In   other   words,   the   High \n\n\n\nCourt has concluded that the award of contract to K.P.Poulose \n\n\n\nwas   a   collective   decision   of   the   Members   of   the   Board.     The \n\n\n\nHigh   Court   also   pointed   out   which   was   again   highlighted   by \n\n\n\nthe   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   for   the   accused   that \n\n\n\nmajority of the Members of the Board were highly qualified and \n\n\n\nresponsible officers and it cannot be said that they were only \n\n\n\nmute witnesses to the decision of the Board.  In this regard, it \n\n\n\nis   relevant   to   point   out   that   the   Special   Court   has   rightly \n\n\n\nconcluded   that  there   was  no  serious  discussion   in   the   Board \n\n\n\nMeeting   dated   19.11.1982   when   the   question   of   award   of \n\n\n\ncontract   was   taken   up   and   the   minutes   of   the   meeting   were \n\n\n\nprepared as dictated by A7, the then Chairman  of the Board. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">The   then   Deputy   Secretary   of   the   Board,   R.   Sankaran   was \n\n\n\nexamined   as   PW-140,   also   admitted   this   aspect   and   stated \n\n\n\nthat   there   was   no   serious   discussion   in   the   meeting   held   on \n\n\n\n19.11.1982.     He   explained   that   Ex.550(a)   minutes   of   the \n\n\n\nmeeting   is   a   reproduction   of   the   dictation   given   by   the \n\n\n\nChairman of the Board (A7).  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                     28</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">19)    The High Court has pointed out that the prosecution has \n\n\n\nnot produced any contemporaneous agreement for proving the \n\n\n\nrates   prevalent   during   the   relevant   period   of   award   of   the \n\n\n\ncontract.     The   High   Court   found   that   the   contract   was \n\n\n\nawarded   at   188%   above   PAC   for   the   tunnel   work   and   162% \n\n\n\nabove PAC for the surge shaft work.   It was pointed out from \n\n\n\nthe   side   of   the   Board   that   the   estimate   rate   was   prepared \n\n\n\ntaking into account the prevalent PWD rates for similar items \n\n\n\nof work like tunnel driving, concrete lining, earth work, cost of \n\n\n\nmaterials, labour charges, transportation charges of materials \n\n\n\nto   worksite   etc.     It   is   not   in   dispute   that   the   contractor   was \n\n\n\nalso   given   opportunity   to   conduct   site   inspection   and   decide \n\n\n\nother   aspects   connected   with   the   execution   of   the   works   for \n\n\n\nsubmitting his tender rate.   Though contractor can also quote \n\n\n\nspecial   conditions   involving   financial   implications   and   other \n\n\n\nconditions   in   the   contract,   which   is   usually   settled   by \n\n\n\nnegotiations,   but   the   general   conditions   of   contract   shall   not \n\n\n\nbe   superseded   while   accepting   special   conditions   to   the \n\n\n\ndetriment of the Board.  The Special Judge had noted that the \n\n\n\nrate   quoted   by   N.K.Kuriakose   (PW-30)   for   tunnel   driving   and \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                      29</span>\n\n\f\nsurge shaft work was below 21.75% of the estimated rate and \n\n\n\nthere   was   much   difference   in   the   rate   quoted   by   K.P.Poulose \n\n\n\nand Kuriakose.   It is further seen that the work was awarded \n\n\n\nto   Kuriakose   at   the   rate   of   Rs.   1,092.3   per   M3  for   sides   and \n\n\n\narches.     The   work   awarded   to   Kuriakose   was   abandoned   by \n\n\n\nhim   since   the   Board   did   not   provide   him   with   necessary \n\n\n\nmaterials  for  proceeding  with the  work as per the agreement. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">He   adduced   evidence   for   the   said   abandonment   and   also \n\n\n\nsuffered loss in that regard for which Board was subsequently \n\n\n\nheld   liable   and   he   was   paid   compensation   as   per   the   Court \n\n\n\norders.     The   work   was   awarded   to   N.K.   Kuriakose   in   1979. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">The Special Court has pointed out that even though there was \n\n\n\nan   increase   of   25%   of   the   actual   rate   awarded   to   Kuriakose, \n\n\n\nstill there was wide difference between the rates at which the \n\n\n\ntwo works were awarded and on this ground also, the Special \n\n\n\nCourt   held   that   the   works   for   floor   concreting   and   for   sides \n\n\n\nand   arches   were   awarded   to   K.P.Poulose   at   a   higher   rate. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">However, the High Court disagreed with the conclusion of the \n\n\n\nSpecial Court.   In this regard, it is useful to refer Ext.P174(2), \n\n\n\nwhich   is   a   report   with   regard   to   the   rate   of   award   of \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                      30</span>\n\n\f\nIdamalayar   contract.     It   was   stated   in   the   report   that   the \n\n\n\nestimate was prepared with the scheduled rate of 1980 which \n\n\n\nhad been enhanced by 25% on labour to obtain 1982 schedule \n\n\n\nand   the   work   was   awarded   after   the   enhancement   of   the \n\n\n\nscheduled   rates.     It   is   further   seen   that   the   estimate   was \n\n\n\nprepared   with   the   scheduled   rate   of   1980   for   the   purpose   of \n\n\n\nobtaining the rate of 1982 i.e. increase of 25% in the rate was \n\n\n\ngiven   in   1980.   The   High   Court   has   justified   the   increase   of \n\n\n\n25%   by   pointing   out   the   increase   mentioned   in   Ext.P299 \n\n\n\nwhich relates to contractor&#x27;s profit of 10%, overhead charges of \n\n\n\n10% and 5% for labour benefits.   Though the High Court has \n\n\n\nagreed   with   the   25%   increase   in   the   rate   of   1980-82,   no \n\n\n\nacceptable evidence was adduced over-riding the documentary \n\n\n\nevidence furnished by Ext.P-299 and P174(2). \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">Award of contract to K.P.

In   the   said   meeting, \n\n\n\nonly A6 and A7 were present and A8, and another member of \n\n\n\nthe pre-qualificaton Committee was not present.   Pursuant to \n\n\n\nthe   decision   that   Full   Board   meeting   should   be   held   on \n\n\n\n19.11.1982   to   decide   the   question   of   award   of   Idamalayar \n\n\n\ncontract,   PW-7   was   directed   to   issue   notice   to   all   the \n\n\n\ntenderers.    The   materials   relied  on  by   the   prosecution   shows \n\n\n\nthat on 18.11.1982, notices were issued to HCC, E.M.Varkey, \n\n\n\nSunny   K.   Peter   and   K.P.Poulose.     It   is   seen   that   only \n\n\n\nK.P.Poulose was present on 19.11.1982.  Sunny K. Peter PW-4 \n\n\n\nsent a telegram on 19.11.1982 stating that he is not physically \n\n\n\nwell.  HCC conveyed their inability to the Board by their letter \n\n\n\nwhich   was   received   in   the   office   of   the   Chief   Engineer   on \n\n\n\n22.11.1982   stating   that   there   was   no   sufficient   time   given   to \n\n\n\nattend   the   Board   Meeting   on   19.11.1982.     Without   verifying \n\n\n\nthe   fact   that   whether   all   the   other   tenderers   were   ready,   a \n\n\n\ndecision was taken on 19.11.1982 itself by accepting the offer \n\n\n\nof K.P.Poulose with special conditions.  As rightly pointed out, \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                    32</span>\n\n\f\nthe Board being a statutory authority, ought to have waited for \n\n\n\na   reply   from   the   other   tenderers   to   ascertain   whether   they \n\n\n\nactually   received   notices   and   reason   for   their   inability   to \n\n\n\nattend.  It was demonstrated that it was a pre-planned attempt \n\n\n\nto award the work to K.P.Poulose alone and the notices issued \n\n\n\nto   other   tenderers  were   in   the   form   of  an   ultimatum.     It   was \n\n\n\nalso   pointed   out   that   for   the   negotiation   on   04.11.1982,   i.e. \n\n\n\nprior to 19.11.1982, held by PW-7, with the tenderers, in the \n\n\n\noffice of the Board only K.P.Poulose and Sunny K. Peter were \n\n\n\npresent.  It is further seen that E.M. Varkey and HCC were not \n\n\n\ninvited.  The fact remains that PW-7 did not invite E.M.Varkey \n\n\n\nwho   quoted   less   rate   and   HCC,   a   reputed   construction \n\n\n\ncompany   for  the   second   negotiation.    Though  a  telegram   was \n\n\n\nsent on behalf of  E.M.Varkey, one  of the tenderers that since \n\n\n\nhe was away and request was made to fix another date, it was \n\n\n\nrecorded   that   the   tenderer   had   already   lost   his   opportunity \n\n\n\noffered.  This has been demonstrated by the appellant that the \n\n\n\nBoard was not prepared to allow the request of E.M. Varkey for \n\n\n\na   discussion.     It   is   useful   to   refer   here   that   the   pre-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">qualification   Committee,   headed   by   A7,   gave   chances   to \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                     33</span>\n\n\f\nK.P.Poulose   to   correct   the   errors   and   mistakes   in   the   tender \n\n\n\nform submitted by him for the impugned works, on the other \n\n\n\nhand,   such   concession   was   not   afforded   to   the   other \n\n\n\ntenderers,   more   particularly,   E.M.   Varkey.     Both   Sunny   K. \n\n\n\nPeter   and   Kuriakose   were   examined   as   PWs-4   and   22 \n\n\n\nrespectively.  The evidence of Kuriakose shows that he was an \n\n\n\nexperienced  contractor, quoted 124% above  PAC  for  the work \n\n\n\nand   submitted   his   tender   on   30.06.1982.     According   to   him, \n\n\n\nhe was not invited for any discussion.   He was disqualified on \n\n\n\n09.09.1982 and was not invited for being present for opening \n\n\n\nhis deviations and conditions in the tender.  In the same way, \n\n\n\nthe evidence of Sunny K. Peter PW-4 also highlighted  how he \n\n\n\nwas   discriminated,   though   he   has   quoted   only   135%   above \n\n\n\nPAC,   he   was   not   given   opportunity   to   consider   the \n\n\n\nreasonableness of the rates quoted by him.  According to him, \n\n\n\nhe   received   notice   only   at   2.40   p.m.   on   18.11.1982   and \n\n\n\nbecause   of   his   illness,   he   could   not   attend   the   meeting   on \n\n\n\n19.11.1982.    The fact remains, the Board has not considered \n\n\n\nhis request and finalised the contract on 19.11.1982 in favour \n\n\n\nof K.P.Poulose.                            \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                     34</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">21)    Another aspect highlighted by the learned counsel for the \n\n\n\nappellant   relates   to   the   conduct   of   A1   with   regard   to \n\n\n\nsettlement   of   labour   dispute.     The   evidence   shows   that   there \n\n\n\nwas   labour   strike   in   the   tunnel   area   which   started   in   April, \n\n\n\n1981   and   continued   from   the   time   of   inviting   tenders   on \n\n\n\n05.06.1981   till   the   time   of   award   of   contract.     It   was \n\n\n\nhighlighted that there was no effort on the part of A1 to settle \n\n\n\nthe labour dispute before tendering process was initiated.   We \n\n\n\nhave highlighted the Memorandum submitted by the labourers \n\n\n\nto A1 on several occasions requesting for settlement of labour \n\n\n\nproblems.  It was not settled and the matter was kept alive till \n\n\n\nthe   tender   was   fixed   in   the   name   of   K.P.Poulose   on \n\n\n\n19.11.1982.     It   was   only   after   the   award   of   the   contract,   A1 \n\n\n\ntook   initiative   to   settle   the   labour   dispute,   more   particularly, \n\n\n\nwhen he came to know that K.P.Poulose cannot enter the site \n\n\n\nbecause of the obstruction of the workers to begin the contract \n\n\n\nwork.  It is relevant to point out that PW-7 informed A1 and A6 \n\n\n\nmore   than   once   that   in   case   the   labour   dispute   could   be \n\n\n\nsettled   in   advance,   the   contract   could   be   awarded   at   a \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                     35</span>\n\n\f\nreasonable rate.   The evidence of PW-7 clearly shows that his \n\n\n\nrequest was not accepted by A1 and A6.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">22)   The evidence discussed  above show  that  the  rate quoted \n\n\n\nby   Sunny   K.   Peter   (PW-4)   vide   his   evidence   in   Court,   was \n\n\n\n135%   above   PAC,   which   was   less   than   188%   above   PAC, \n\n\n\nquoted by K.P. Poulose and approved by the Board.   The High \n\n\n\nCourt failed to take note of the importance of evidence of PW-4 \n\n\n\nand   justified   the   action   of   the   Board   in   not   pursuing   the \n\n\n\ntender   submitted   by   Sunny  K  Peter   (PW-4)   with   a   lesser   rate \n\n\n\non the ground that his tender is liable to be rejected since he \n\n\n\nwanted   an   arbitration   clause   in   the   agreement.     Further, \n\n\n\nthough PW-4 has quoted lesser rate than K.P. Poulose, in his \n\n\n\nevidence,   he   has   highlighted   that   he   was   not   given   an \n\n\n\nopportunity to consider the reasonableness of the rate quoted \n\n\n\nby   him   i.e.   135%   above   PAC.     The   High   Court   has   not   only \n\n\n\nignored his assertion but found that the rate quoted by him for \n\n\n\nthe surge shaft work is not a lesser rate when compared to one \n\n\n\nquoted   by   K.P.   Poulose   i.e.,   188%   above   PAC.     Though   the \n\n\n\nSpecial Court has correctly found that Sunny K. Peter quoted \n\n\n\nless than the rate quoted by K.P. Poulose, the High Court, on \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    36</span>\n\n\f\nerroneous   assumption   found   fault   with   the   finding   of   the \n\n\n\nSpecial Court which correctly appreciated prosecution case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">Acceptance of Special Conditions &amp; Concessions\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">23)     With   regard   to   allegation   of   the   prosecution   that   certain \n\n\n\nSpecial   Conditions   were   accepted   by   the   Board   (Ex.   P588) \n\n\n\ninvolving   huge   financial   commitments   favourable   to   the \n\n\n\ncontractor causing loss to the Board, it is relevant to mention \n\n\n\nthat   one   of   the   special   conditions,   is   condition   No.   4   which \n\n\n\nrelates to tools and plants sold to the contractor in violation of \n\n\n\nthe   General   Conditions   of   the   contract.     These   special \n\n\n\nconditions   along   with   other   conditions   were   accepted   by   the \n\n\n\nBoard   superseding   corresponding   agreement   provisions.     Ex \n\n\n\nP52 (c) is the general conditions of contract and instructions to \n\n\n\nthe contractors issued by the Board.   Among various clauses, \n\n\n\nClause E1-091 in Ex. P52(c) deals with tools and plants issued \n\n\n\nto   the   contractors.     This   clause   provides   that   the   Board   is \n\n\n\nbound   to   make   available   to   the   contractors   only   such   tools \n\n\n\nand   plants   listed   in   the   Schedule   attached   thereto,   that   too \n\n\n\nsubject   to   availability.     Such  items   of   tools   and   plants   which \n\n\n\nare listed in Ex. P52 agreement marked as Ex. P52(d) shows 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                     37</span>\n\n\f\nitems   of   tools   and   plants   which   can   be   hired   out   to   the \n\n\n\ncontractors   if   requested   on   the   specified   rates.   In   Ex.   P58, \n\n\n\ndeviations and conditions submitted by the contractor as Item \n\n\n\nNo   4,   stated   that   such   tools   and   plants   listed   in   Ex.   P52(d) \n\n\n\nshall be sold to him on outright sale at book value deducting \n\n\n\ndepreciation   and   the   cost   may   be   recovered   on   prorata   basis \n\n\n\nfrom   his   bills.     The   full   Board,   in   its   decision   dated \n\n\n\n19.11.1982,   had   accepted   the   above   special   condition   of   the \n\n\n\ncontractor.  It is relevant to point out that these items includes \n\n\n\ntipper   wagons   loco,   louder,   existing   truck   lines   and   pipes, \n\n\n\nitems which can only be hired to the contractor as per clause \n\n\n\nE1-091   of   the   General   Conditions   of   the   contract.     It   is   the \n\n\n\ncase of the prosecution that it was the decision of the Board to \n\n\n\nsell those items of tools and plants which includes very costly \n\n\n\nforeign imported materials.   The official examined on the side \n\n\n\nof the prosecution pointed out that there is no provision in the \n\n\n\ngeneral conditions of the contract enabling the Board to effect \n\n\n\nsale   of   those   tools   and   plants   to   the   contractor.     However, \n\n\n\ncertain materials belonging to the Board mentioned in Clause \n\n\n\nE1-093   and   not   covered   by   the   list   mentioned   in   Clause   E1-\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                     38</span>\n\n\f\n091 could be sold to the contractors if available to the Board. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">The   evidence   led   in   clearly   shows   that   the   sale   of   materials \n\n\n\nlisted   in   Clause   E1-093   supersedes   the   general   conditions   of \n\n\n\ncontract.     In   other   words,   it   is   clear   from   the   evidence   that \n\n\n\nthose   materials   which   were   not   mentioned   in   the   Special \n\n\n\nConditions were sold to the contractor on outright sale.  In this \n\n\n\nregard,   it   is   useful   to   refer   the   evidence   of   Udayabhanu \n\n\n\nKandeth PW-136, Auditor attached to the Accountant General \n\n\n\nOffice   which   shows   that   126   items   of   tools   and   plants   were \n\n\n\nsold to the contractor of which the cost of 117 items was Rs. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">16.5 lakhs.   The  Auditor of the  Board,  who was examined as \n\n\n\nPW-130,   also   explained   about   the   sale   of   tools   and   plants   to \n\n\n\nthe contractor, which was not provided in the agreement.  It is \n\n\n\nclear from the evidence that the sale of tools and plants which \n\n\n\ncould only be hired to the contractor as per the list in E1-091 \n\n\n\nwas against the objections raised by A8, the Financial Advisor \n\n\n\nand   Chief   Accounts   Officer   of   the   Board   during   the   relevant \n\n\n\nperiod.     In   his   report,   A8   had   noted   that   the   financial \n\n\n\nimplications   involved   in   the   sale   of   items   of   tools   and   plants \n\n\n\nwere   not   considered   either   by   the   Board   or   by   the   officers   of \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                      39</span>\n\n\f\nthe Board at the time when the full Board decided to sanction \n\n\n\nthe   above   special   condition   No.   4   of   the   contract.     These \n\n\n\naspects   have   been   duly   considered   by   the   Special   Court, \n\n\n\nnamely, that the tools and plants which are only to be hired as \n\n\n\nper   Clause   E1-091   to   the   contractor,   however,   the   Board \n\n\n\npermitted   outright   sale   which   is   detrimental   to   the   financial \n\n\n\ninterest   of   the   Board.     These   important   aspects   have   been \n\n\n\noverlooked   by   the   High   Court   while   upsetting   the   decision   of \n\n\n\nthe Special Court.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">24)  In addition to the same, the prosecution has led in further \n\n\n\nevidence   to   show   that   the   contractor   was   favored   in   several \n\n\n\naspects.        PW-128,   V.   Ramanarayanan,   Superintending \n\n\n\nEngineer,   in   his   evidence   has   stated   that   pental   placer,   an \n\n\n\nimported   item   not   included   in   the   list   for   issue   on   hire,   was \n\n\n\nsold to the contractor, the sale value of which was Rs. 4 lakhs \n\n\n\nand   according   to   him   only   lump   sum   recoveries   were   made \n\n\n\nfrom the CC bills of the contractor, instead of prorata recovery \n\n\n\nas provided in the agreement.

The Financial \n\n\n\nAdvisor   and   Chief   Accounts   Officer,   who   arrayed   as   A8,   had \n\n\n\nstated in Ext. P-416 that without evaluating the exact financial \n\n\n\nimplications,   sanction   was   accorded   by   the   Board   to   the \n\n\n\nspecial condition regarding return of empty cement bags to the \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                   41</span>\n\n\f\nadvantage of the Contractor for getting financial gain.  Though \n\n\n\nit is stated that the condition only provides for return of 50% \n\n\n\nempty   cement   bags   in   good   condition   and   for   the   remaining, \n\n\n\nthe   rate   provided   by   the   general   conditions   of   contract   could \n\n\n\nbe  realised   from  the  Contractor,  the  fact  remains,  the  special \n\n\n\ncondition   which   we   are   concerned   does   not   provide   for   the \n\n\n\nrealisation of value of the remaining unreturned cement bags.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">26)    With   regard   to   special   conditions,   the   High   Court   has \n\n\n\nheld that inasmuch as there is a provision in tender to enable \n\n\n\nthe Contractor to get special conditions, it cannot be said that \n\n\n\nthe special conditions and deviations of the Contractor should \n\n\n\nnot   be   accepted.     Here,   the   High   Court   has   missed   the   real \n\n\n\nissue as to whether all special conditions as requested by the \n\n\n\nContractor   can   be   sanctioned   by   the   Board   in   violation   of \n\n\n\ngeneral  conditions  of  contract,  which  is  the   standing order  of \n\n\n\nthe Board applicable to all contracts and the policy adopted by \n\n\n\nthe Board.   Simply because there is a provision to enable the \n\n\n\ncontractor to suggest special conditions advantageous to him, \n\n\n\nit does not mean that the Contractor can suggest any special \n\n\n\ncondition which involved financial implication to the detriment \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                    42</span>\n\n\f\nof   the   Board.       As   correctly   found   by   the   Special   Court,   the \n\n\n\nspecial condition No.4 relating to sale of tools and plants is a \n\n\n\nfavour   done   by   the   Board   to   the   Contractor   for   obtaining \n\n\n\nfinancial gains at the risk of Board&#x27;s loss.   The Special Court \n\n\n\nhas   substantiated   its   finding   on   the   point   based   on   evidence \n\n\n\nfurnished by the auditors.  However, the High Court relying on \n\n\n\nExt   D-28   provided   for   recovery   of   balance   50%   of   empty \n\n\n\ncement   bags   not   returned   or   returned   in   damaged   condition \n\n\n\nand   recovery   will   be   effected   as   stipulated   in   the   tender \n\n\n\ncondition, erroneously concluded no loss could be sustained to \n\n\n\nthe Board.  It is relevant to point out that the special condition \n\n\n\nNo.10 clearly states that the contractor is bound to return only \n\n\n\n50% empty cement bags in good condition.   To make it clear, \n\n\n\nthis condition supersedes the corresponding general condition \n\n\n\nof the contract.   Therefore, the Contractor is bound to return \n\n\n\n50%  of  empty cement bags  in good condition and  there is  no \n\n\n\nneed to pay the price of balance 50%.   Accordingly, the Board \n\n\n\ncan   act   only   on   the   basis   of   the   special   condition   No.10 \n\n\n\nregarding the return of empty cement bags and is not entitled \n\n\n\nto   recover   the   value   of   balance   50%   of   unreturned   cement \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                     43</span>\n\n\f\nbags.     The   contrary   conclusion   arrived   at   by   the   High   Court \n\n\n\nrelating to return of empty cement bags cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">Fixation of security and retention:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">27)    Yet   another   special   condition   involving   financial \n\n\n\nimplications sanctioned to the Contractor is with regard to the \n\n\n\nfixation   of   security   and   retention   amount.     Special   Condition \n\n\n\nNo.1 of Ext.P-588 deals with this subject.  It is the prosecution \n\n\n\ncase   that   restriction   of   security   and   retention   amount   is   in \n\n\n\nviolation of the provisions contained in the general conditions \n\n\n\nof   the   contract   and   it   is   a  favour   shown   to   the   Contractor   to \n\n\n\nmake illegal gains at the expense of the Board.  Clause E1-008 \n\n\n\nof Ext. P52(c) is the provision relating to security deposit of the \n\n\n\nContractor which states that for major works where the cost of \n\n\n\nconstruction exceeds Rs.25 lakhs, the security deposit should \n\n\n\nbe 2% of the PAC.  In the case on hand, the PAC of Idamalayar \n\n\n\ncontract   works   exceeds  Rs.25   lakhs.     There   is   no  dispute   for \n\n\n\nthe same.   The security for both works should be fixed at 2% \n\n\n\nof   the   PAC.     Clause   E1-011   of   ExtP-52   is   the   general \n\n\n\nconditions of contract and instruction to the tenderers dealing \n\n\n\nwith   retention   of   the   money   from   the   bills   payable   to   the \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                      44</span>\n\n\f\nContractor.     As   per   this   clause,   from   each   bill   of   the \n\n\n\nContractor   10%   should   be   deducted   towards   additional \n\n\n\nsecurity.   However, the retention was not to exceed 5% of the \n\n\n\nPAC where cost of work exceeds Rs.25 lakhs.  Therefore, 5% of \n\n\n\nPAC   is   to   be   retained   as   retention   amount   for   both   these \n\n\n\nworks.     In   this   regard,   it   is   relevant   to   refer   the   special \n\n\n\ncondition.   In   the   case   of   tunnel   work,   the   retention   and \n\n\n\nsecurity is limited to Rs.5 lakhs which is clear from Ext.P-71. \n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">Likewise, in the case of surge shaft, security is limited to Rs.1 \n\n\n\nlakh as evidenced by Ext.P-69.  This is also strengthened from \n\n\n\nthe   evidence   of   PW-8   who   was   the   Executive   Engineer   in   the \n\n\n\nIdamalayar   project.     He   explained   that   the   security   amount \n\n\n\nand retention amount due from the contractor would come to \n\n\n\nRs.12 lakhs.  Inasmuch as the PAC for both works would come \n\n\n\nto Rs.2,45,80,796/-, the retention amount in the case of surge \n\n\n\nshaft   work   would   come   to   Rs.7.2   lakhs,   which   is   5%   of   the \n\n\n\nPAC.     PW-8   has   explained   that   the   restriction   of   retention \n\n\n\namount   is   a   benefit   shown   to   the   Contractor.     In   Ext.P-65, \n\n\n\nreport   of   PW-7,   also   calculated   financial   loss   that   will   be \n\n\n\nsustained   by   the   Board   in   limiting   security   and   retention \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                    45</span>\n\n\f\namount   of   the   Contractor.     In   the   same   report,   PW-7   also \n\n\n\nmentioned the loss of interest for the same.   It is also pointed \n\n\n\nout  that  due to  restricting the  security and  retention amount \n\n\n\nas   per   the   special   condition   No.1,   sanctioned   to   the \n\n\n\nContractor, the liquidated  damages payable by the contractor \n\n\n\nshall   not   exceed   the   whole   amount   of   retention   plus   security \n\n\n\ndeposit.     The   result   of   restriction   of   security   and   retention   is \n\n\n\nthat the liquidated damages payable by the Contractor is also \n\n\n\nautomatically restricted accordingly.   In that event, the Board \n\n\n\nis   not   entitled   to   recover   any   amount   by   way   of   liquidated \n\n\n\ndamages   even   if   the   Contractor   is   guilty   of   negligence   or \n\n\n\ndefault.     All   these   aspects   have   been   properly   scrutinized   by \n\n\n\nthe   Special   Court.     No   doubt,   the   High   Court   relied   on   the \n\n\n\nevidence   of  Madhavan   Potti  (PW-5)   that  acceptance   of   special \n\n\n\nconditions   in  a  contract   is   a  normal  procedure.     In  the   same \n\n\n\nway, the High Court has also placed  reliance on the evidence \n\n\n\nof   Ramanarayanan   (PW-21)   that   reduction   of   security   and \n\n\n\nretention   amount   is   also   a   normal   procedure.     A   perusal   of \n\n\n\nKerala   State   Electricity   Board   Tender   Regulations   show   that \n\n\n\nthe reduction of security deposit is permissible only in the case \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                      46</span>\n\n\f\nof established firm/Company and that the security deposit of a \n\n\n\nnew  contractor  shall  not  be  reduced.    The course  adopted  by \n\n\n\nthe Board is contrary to the condition contained in Regulation \n\n\n\nNo.25(c)   of   the   Board&#x27;s   Regulations.     Though   the   High   Court \n\n\n\nhas   observed   that   in   all   major   contracts,   it   is   an   accepted \n\n\n\npractice to put a ceiling on the security and retention amount \n\n\n\nand there is no acceptable evidence to support such a finding, \n\n\n\nwe are unable to accept the observation of the High Court that \n\n\n&quot;for   the   success   of   execution   of   major   contract   works, \n\n\nsmall   favours   are   inevitable&quot;.     We   conclude   that   the   above \n\n\nobservation   of   the   High   Court   is   based   on   a   general   opinion \n\n\n\nnot supported by any material or evidence on record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">Criminal Conspiracy\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">28)    On   this   aspect,   the   Special   Court   has   analysed   the \n\n\n\nevidence of witnesses and considered the documents produced \n\n\n\nand   marked   by   the   prosecution   and   concluded   that   there   is \n\n\n\nsufficient   evidence   for   finding   that   a   criminal   conspiracy   was \n\n\n\nhatched   out   at   the   instance   of   A1   (R.Balakrishna   Pillai,   the \n\n\n\nthen   Minister   for   Electricity)   and   P.K.   Sajeev   (A3)   who   was   a \n\n\n\nclose associate and political ally of A1.

Nobody   has   challenged   the \n\n\n\nrelationship   between   A1   and   A3.     It   is   the   case   of   the \n\n\n\nprosecution that a conspiracy was hatched out at the instance \n\n\n\nof   A1   and   others   with   the   illegal   object   of   getting   the \n\n\n\nIdamalayar   project   fixed   on   one   among   themselves   at \n\n\n\nexorbitant rates and make illegal profits.  It is also the definite \n\n\n\ncase of the prosecution that though the work was awarded in \n\n\n\nthe name of K.P.Poulouse, one of the accused, it was actually \n\n\n\nexecuted   by   A3   and   another   accused   Paul   Mundakkal \n\n\n\n(deceased).   It has come in evidence that the amount of work \n\n\n\nwas   invested   and   payments   were   made   by   Paul   Mundakkal \n\n\n\nand   A3.     As   rightly   observed   by   the   Special   Court,   the \n\n\n\nrelationship between A1 and A3 is a relevant factor in arriving \n\n\n\nat   the   circumstances   leading   to   the   formation   of   the \n\n\n\nconspiracy.  The evidence led in normally show that A3 was an \n\n\n\nintimate   friend   of   A1   and   very   closely   moving   with   him   who \n\n\n\nwas   the   Minister   for   Electricity   during   the   relevant   period. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">PW-21,   in   his   evidence,   has   stated   that   A3   was   an   active \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                   48</span>\n\n\f\nmember and leader of Kerala Congress Party led by A1 at the \n\n\n\ntime when works were allotted.  PW-3, who was a watchman of \n\n\n\nthe  Inspection   Bungalow  at  Idamalayar   was  examined  on  the \n\n\n\nside   of   the   prosecution   has   stated   that   A1   and   A3   used   to \n\n\n\ncome   and   stayed   in   the   Inspection   Bungalow.     He   further \n\n\n\nasserted   that   it   was   A3   and   the   deceased   Paul   Mundakkal, \n\n\n\nwho   were   supervising   the   work   at   site.     In   addition   to   the \n\n\n\nevidence   of   PW-3,   the   evidence   of   PWs   6,   7   and   8   who   were \n\n\n\nEngineers   at   the   relevant   time   at   Idamalayar   worksite   and \n\n\n\nsupervising   execution   of   works   corroborated   the   evidence   of \n\n\n\nPW-3.   PWs 24, 25 and 26 also supported the above claim of \n\n\n\nthe prosecution.  PW-25, one of the workers at Idamalayar also \n\n\n\ndeposed   that   he   was   working   with   A6,   who   was   managing \n\n\n\nIdamalayar   works.     PW-26,   another   worker   also   stated   that \n\n\n\nwhen he went to the house of A3, he saw A1 in his house. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">29)    The   prosecution   has   established   the   relationship   and \n\n\n\nfriendship between A1 and A3 by placing acceptable evidence. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">The   nomination   of   A3   to   Board&#x27;s   Consultative   Council   was \n\n\n\nmade at the instance of A1.

The \n\n\n\nevidence   of   PWs   18,   27   and   51   and   Ext.180(c)   establish   the \n\n\n\ncase of the prosecution.   The evidence further shows that the \n\n\n\nmandatory requirements contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1149958/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 16</a> of the \n\n\n\nAct regarding the constitution of Consultative Council was not \n\n\n\nadhered to by A1 who wanted to include A3 in the panel which \n\n\n\nstates   that   the   State   Government   may   constitute   the \n\n\n\nConsultative   Council   considering   all   representatives   of   power \n\n\n\ngenerating  companies and  other  persons in  consultation with \n\n\n\nthe   representative   bodies   of   various   interests,   namely, \n\n\n\nindustry,   commerce,   agriculture,   transport   etc.     It   makes   it \n\n\n\nclear   that   consultation   with   the   representative   bodies   of \n\n\n\nvarious   interests   is   a   mandatory   condition   precedent   for \n\n\n\nappointment   of   a   Member   by   the   Government   in   the   Board&#x27;s \n\n\n\nConsultative   Committee.     But   in   the   case   on   hand,   from   the \n\n\n\nevidence, it is clear that there was no such consultation by the \n\n\n\nGovernment   before   making   nomination   of   A3   who   was   the \n\n\n\nSecretary of Kothamangalam Bus Owners Association.   It was \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                   50</span>\n\n\f\npointed   out   that   usually   the   representatives   of   State   Level \n\n\n\nOrganisers   representing   various   interests   alone   were \n\n\n\nnominated   after   consultation   by   the   Government   with   such \n\n\n\nbodies.     Admittedly,   A3   was   not   representing   any   State   Level \n\n\n\nBus Owners Association.   This is evident from the evidence of \n\n\n\nPWs   31   and   16.

Poulose regarding the award of \n\n\n\ncontract work at Idamalayer.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">31)  The role played by A3 in fixing the contract to K.P. Poulose \n\n\n\nis   also   relevant   to   infer   the   formation   of   agreement   between \n\n\n\nhimself and A1, the Minister for Electricity. In addition to the \n\n\n\nsame, the prosecution has adduced acceptable evidence that a \n\n\n\ncompany   by   name   Hydro   Power   Construction   Company   was \n\n\n\nregistered as a partnership firm with K.P. Poulose as Managing \n\n\n\nPartner   and   A3   and   Paul   Mundakkal   as   Working   Partners. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">Further,   close   relatives   of   K.P.   Poulose,   A3   and   Paul \n\n\n\nMundakkal were parties to the partnership deed.  The object of \n\n\n\nthe   partnership   was   to   execute   the   Idamalayar   tunnel   work \n\n\n\nand   also   the   surge   shaft   work   in   the   name   of   the   Company. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">The said firm was an assessee under the income tax Act which \n\n\n\nis   evident   from   Ex.   P245,   the   income-tax   assessment   of   the \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                    52</span>\n\n\f\nfirm in the year 1984-85 and 1985-86.   K.P. Poulose, A3 and \n\n\n\nPaul Mundakkal were submitting income tax returns and this \n\n\n\nis   evident   from   the   evidence   of   PW-123,   an   Income-tax \n\n\n\npractitioner.  In addition to the same, when A3 was questioned \n\n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., he admitted that he invested good \n\n\n\namount for the work and visited the site to watch the progress \n\n\n\nof   the   work.     The   fact   that   A1,   while   as   a   Minister   for \n\n\n\nElectricity,   interfered   with   the   award   of   the   contracts   of   the \n\n\n\nBoard were spoken to by PW-64, PW-66, PW-138 and PW-146 \n\n\n\nwhich we have already discussed in the earlier paragraphs.  It \n\n\n\nis also clear that A1 was awaiting for a probable contractor of \n\n\n\nhis   choice   to   undertake   the   Idamalayar   works   at   exorbitant \n\n\n\nrates.   \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">32)   There was labour agitation prevailing at Idamalayar work \n\n\n\nsite.   The workers brought from Moolamattom, Kulamavu etc. \n\n\n\nwent on strike demanding execution of the work on piece rate \n\n\n\nbasis   and   also   for   absorption   in   permanent   service   of   the \n\n\n\nBoard.     At   the   time,   when   the   tendering   process   of   the   work \n\n\n\nwas started by the Chief Engineer, Bharathan, strike situation \n\n\n\nwas pending at Idamalayar which continued till the work was \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                    53</span>\n\n\f\nawarded in 1982.   It is in evidence that after execution of the \n\n\n\nagreement of the Idamalayar work by K.P. Poulose, there was \n\n\n\nobstruction   from   the   striking   workers   preventing   him   from \n\n\n\nentering   the   worksite   and   consequently   A1   interfered   and \n\n\n\nsettled the labour dispute by awarding a compensation of Rs. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">11   lakhs   to   the   striking   workers   and   the   worksite   was   made \n\n\n\nclear   free   of   any   labour   unrest.     It   is   the   prosecution&#x27;s   case \n\n\n\nthat   this   was   done   to   help   the   contractor,   a   party   to   the \n\n\n\nconspiracy   for   execution   of   the   work   and   make   illegal   profit \n\n\n\ntherefrom.     The   evidence   of   PW-7,   Chief   Engineer   and   other \n\n\n\nwitnesses   stated   that   the   awarding   of   Idamalayar   work   at \n\n\n\nexorbitant   rate   could   have   been   avoided   in   case   the   labour \n\n\n\nissue was settled earlier.  The prosecution has also highlighted \n\n\n\nlabour   unrest   at   Idamalayar   which   was   kept   pending   at   the \n\n\n\ninstance   of   A1   and   other   interested   parties   so   as   to   make   it \n\n\n\nappear that no contractor will come forward to undertake the \n\n\n\ncontract,   so   much   so   that   there   is   possibility   of   choosing   a \n\n\n\ncontractor   of   their   choice   for   the   execution   of   the   work   at \n\n\n\nexorbitant rate.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                      54</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">33)   The  prosecution  has also  highlighted  that  to  achieve  the \n\n\n\nillegal   object   of   finding   the   contract   in   the   name   of   K.P. \n\n\n\nPoulose   at   exorbitant   rate,   the   pre-qualification   system   was \n\n\n\nintroduced   by   the   Board   vide   order   Ex.   P576   dated \n\n\n\n24.09.1981.   This was after tendering process has started for \n\n\n\nthe   Idamalayar   work.     One   Alexander   Vellappally,   who   was \n\n\n\nexamined   as   PW-138,   explained   before   the   Court   that   pre-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">qualification   bid   system   was   misused   by   the   Board   to \n\n\n\nsafeguard   vested   interest   by   choosing   contractors   of   their \n\n\n\nchoice.     From   the   proceedings   initiated   by   the   Board   on \n\n\n\n19.11.1982,   passing   a   resolution   to   award   the   work   to   K.P. \n\n\n\nPoulose,   a   scheme   of   pre-qualification   bid   was   successfully \n\n\n\noperated   by   the   Board   authorities   at   the   instance   of   A1   for \n\n\n\npaving the way clear to K.P. Poulose to get the work at a very \n\n\n\nhigh rate.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">34)     With   regard   to   the   relationship   between   A1   and   A3,   the \n\n\n\nprosecution   has  relied  on the  evidence  of  PW-19,  receptionist \n\n\n\nof   the   Paramount   Tourist   Home   who   has   stated   that   A3   was \n\n\n\noccupying   a   room   on   17.11.1982   and   19.11.1982   on   rent   at \n\n\n\nParamount   Tourist   Home.     Exs.   P185,   186   and   187   are \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                    55</span>\n\n\f\nregisters maintained in the Tourist Home and relevant entries \n\n\n\ntherein were marked and proved by PW-19.  According to him, \n\n\n\nA3,   took   a   room   in   the   Tourist   Home   at   11:50   a.m.   on \n\n\n\n17.11.1982 and vacated the room on 5:00 p.m. on 19.11.1982. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">The Special Court noted the significance of his stay during the \n\n\n\nabove   period   at   Thiruvananthapuram.     A3,   in   all   probability, \n\n\n\nwas at Thiruvananthapuram to meet A1 and also to meet PW-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">7,   Chief   Engineer,   A6   and   A7,   to   work   out   the   scheme   for \n\n\n\ngetting the contract in favour of K.P. Poulose at a higher rate \n\n\n\nafter   avoiding   other   tenderers.     It   is   further   evident   that   A3 \n\n\n\ntook   the   room   on   17.11.1982   when   the   Full   Board   meeting \n\n\n\nwas   considering   the   tender   of   K.P.   Poulose   and   left   the   room \n\n\n\non   5:00   p.m.   on  19.11.1982   after   the   tender   was   awarded   to \n\n\n\nK.P. Poulose.   The close intimacy of A3 with A1 is well known \n\n\n\nand his influence over A1 might have persuaded A6 and A7 to \n\n\n\nfix   the   contract   on   K.P.   Poulose.     PW-7,   Chief   Engineer   has \n\n\n\ndeposed before the Court that A3 met him on 04.11.1982 and \n\n\n\nrequested   him   to   make   a   recommendation   for   awarding   the \n\n\n\ncontract to K.P. Poulose.  A3 also told PW-7 that when A1 was \n\n\n\ntalking over phone to PW-7, while in the office of the Chairman \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                     56</span>\n\n\f\nof   the   Board,   the   witness   was   present   in   the   chamber   of   A1 \n\n\n\nand asked PW-7 what was the difficulty in recommending the \n\n\n\ncontract   even   after   A1   directed   him   to   do   so.     The   Special \n\n\n\nCourt,   after   analysing  the  evidence   in  detail   found  that  A3  is \n\n\n\nthe man behind the manuring for getting the contract awarded \n\n\n\nto K.P. Poulose.  K.P. Poulose, however, was only a benamidar \n\n\n\nand A3 and Paul Mundakkal were the beneficiaries though the \n\n\n\nwork   was   awarded   in   the   name   of   K.P.   Poulose.     The \n\n\n\nprosecution   has   also   highlighted   and   proved   that   A1   was \n\n\n\nawaiting for a better contractor, who would quote higher rate, \n\n\n\nwhen PW-146 Kamalasanan, Managing Partner, We-Build was \n\n\n\nnot  willing  to  quote  a higher   rate  as  desired  by   A1.     The  role \n\n\n\nplayed by A6 in the matter of hatching out the conspiracy and \n\n\n\nthe   fulfillment   of   the   unlawful   object   is   proved   by   evidence, \n\n\n\nparticularly,   from   the   evidence   of   PW-7.     From   the   above \n\n\n\nmaterials, it is clear that a criminal conspiracy among A1, A3 \n\n\n\nand A6 can be inferred.  A1, as Minister for Electricity is all in \n\n\n\nall dealing with the efforts of the Board including the awarding \n\n\n\nor   cancellation   of   the   contracts.     The   officers   and   the   Board \n\n\n\nmembers were under his pressure and fear which clearly seen \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                    57</span>\n\n\f\nfrom the statements of prosecution witnesses, namely, PWs 8, \n\n\n\n36, 60, 62, 138, 140, 64, 66 etc.  It is also relevant to point out \n\n\n\nthat A6 and A7 avoided considering the request of PW-4 in his \n\n\n\ntelegram sent to the Board.   We have already adverted  to the \n\n\n\nfact that it was Sunny K. Peter, PW-4, who quoted a lesser rate \n\n\n\nthan   K.P.   Poulose.     He   quoted   only   135%   above   PAC.     By \n\n\n\narranging the Board meeting on 19.11.1982, with short notice \n\n\n\nof   less   than   24   hours,   the   intention   was   to   avoid   other \n\n\n\ntenderers and to achieve the object of conspiracy to award the \n\n\n\ncontract to K.P. Poulose who alone was present on 17.11.1982 \n\n\n\nand 19.11.1982.  The request of E.M. Varkey for fixing another \n\n\n\ndate   for   participating   in   the   discussion   for   award   of   the \n\n\n\ncontract   was   also   rejected.     From   these   materials,   as   rightly \n\n\n\nconcluded   by   the   Special  Court,   it  leads   to   a  conclusion   that \n\n\n\nseveral out of way methods were adopted by the Board at the \n\n\n\ninstance of A1 for achieving the object of conspiracy.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">35)   As   rightly   pointed   out   by   the   Special   Court,   the \n\n\n\nconfirmation   of   Hydro   Power   Construction   Company \n\n\n\nconsisting   of   A3,   A4   and   Paul   Mundakkal   and   their   close \n\n\n\nassociates   and   relations   for   execution   of   Idamalayar   contract \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                   58</span>\n\n\f\nwork,   A3   supervising   the   execution   of   the   contract   work   and \n\n\n\nthe   visit   of   A4   at   the   worksite   only   on   rare   occasions,   the \n\n\n\npayment of wages to the labourers by A3 and Paul Mundakkal \n\n\n\nare   all   proved   various   circumstances   that   the   conspiracy \n\n\n\namong the accused continued to operate even after the award \n\n\n\nof   the   contract.     The   High   Court   failed   to   consider   various \n\n\n\ninstances   and   materials   placed   by   the   prosecution   in   respect \n\n\n\nof charge relating to conspiracy.  According to the High Court, \n\n\n\n&quot;the   proved   circumstances   are   not  sufficient   to  hold   that \n\n\nthere   was   conspiracy   as   alleged   by   the   prosecution   or   as \n\n\nfound by the Special Court.&quot; Before us, it was demonstrated \n\n\nthat several material aspects have not been considered by the \n\n\n\nHigh Court, for example, the stay of A3 at Paramount Tourist \n\n\n\nHome,   Thiruvananthapuram   on   the   crucial   dates   i.e.,   on \n\n\n\n17.11.1982   to   19.11.1982   has   not   been   considered   by   the \n\n\n\nHigh  Court   in the  correct  perspective.   As  pointed  out  by  the \n\n\n\nappellant,   the   High   Court   ought   to   have   found   that   the \n\n\n\nevidence relating to A3 at Paramount Tourist Home is only to \n\n\n\nbring out one of the circumstances leading to the formation of \n\n\n\ncriminal   conspiracy   hatched   out   by   the   accused.     In   fact,   A3 \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                     59</span>\n\n\f\nhas admitted his stay in his <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. statement at \n\n\n\nThiruvananthapuram   on   those   dates,   hence,   finding   by   the \n\n\n\nHigh   Court   on   this   aspect,   faulting   with   the   Special   Court \n\n\n\ncannot   be   sustained.     Even   though,   the   High   Court   has \n\n\n\nadmitted that A1 and A3 belonged to the same political party \n\n\n\nand close relationship exists between the two, the nomination \n\n\n\nof A3 in the Consultative Council of the Board as evidenced by \n\n\n\nEx.P-180 was unfortunately not recognised by the High Court \n\n\n\nas  a material  evidence  proved by the  prosecution.   Insofar  as \n\n\n\nclaim   of   PW-3   that   it   was   he   who   settled   the   bill   in   the \n\n\n\ninspection   bungalow,   the   perusal   of   his   entire   oral   evidence \n\n\n\nclearly supports the case pleaded by the prosecution insofar as \n\n\n\nthe  close  association  between  A1 and  A3  during  their   visit  to \n\n\n\nthe   worksite.     PW-7,   former   Chief   Engineer,   a   most   reliable \n\n\n\nwitness was examined in the presence of A3 on 04.11.1982 in \n\n\n\nthe   Board&#x27;s   office.   There   is   no   necessity   to   corroborate   or \n\n\n\nfurther   material  in addition  to the oral evidence  of PW-7.    As \n\n\n\nrightly analysed and concluded  by the Special Court, there is \n\n\n\nno infirmity in the evidence of PW-7 merely because there is no \n\n\n\ndocumentary evidence in respect of the presence of A3 at the \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                    60</span>\n\n\f\nBoard&#x27;s meeting.

We   have   already   highlighted   the   reasoning   of   the \n\n\n\nSpecial Court relating to the important fact that contract  was \n\n\n\nawarded at exorbitant rate, reduction in retention and security \n\n\n\namount,   return   of   50%   empty   cement   bags   and   also \n\n\n\nacceptance   of   special   conditions   for   the   sale   of   tools   and \n\n\n\nplants.     In   the   instant   case,   all   the   ingredients   of   criminal \n\n\n\nconspiracy   are   satisfied   for   convicting   A1,   A3   and   A6   for   the \n\n\n\noffence charged against them.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                     61</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">Special mention about PW-7, retired Chief Engineer of the \n\n\nBoard &amp; PW-46\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">37)    The   High   Court   as   well   as   learned   senior   counsel \n\n\n\nappearing for the accused commented the evidence of PW-7 by \n\n\n\nsaying   that   there   are   inherent   improbabilities   and \n\n\n\ninconsistencies and his evidence is not cogent and convincing \n\n\n\nwhereas   among   several   witnesses   examined,   prosecution \n\n\n\nheavily   relied   on   the   statement   of   PW-7,   a   retired   Chief \n\n\n\nEngineer.   He retired from service on March 1985.   He joined \n\n\n\nthe service of the Board on July 1954 as Junior Engineer and \n\n\n\nprior to that he was in the Electricity Department.

The prosecution heavily relied on his evidence and, in \n\n\n\nfact,   Mr   Shanti   Bhushan   in   support   of   his   argument   mainly \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                     62</span>\n\n\f\nrelied   on   the   evidence   of   PW-7.     By   his   rich   experience   and \n\n\n\nworked as a Chief Engineer at the relevant time, namely, when \n\n\n\nIdamalayar project was commissioned, PW-7 furnished all the \n\n\n\ndetails with reference to various documents such as his report, \n\n\n\nopinion, minutes of the meeting of the Board with reference to \n\n\n\nIdamalayar   project.     No   doubt,   all   the   three   senior   counsel \n\n\n\nappearing for the accused A1, A3 and A6 severely criticized his \n\n\n\nconduct   in   not  answering   many  of  the  questions   in  his  cross \n\n\n\nexamination.     It   is   true   that   in   chief-examination,   PW-7 \n\n\n\nhighlighted various aspects with reference to documents such \n\n\n\nas   opinion,   report   and   Board&#x27;s   proceedings   and   minutes \n\n\n\nthereon.  From the perusal of his cross-examination, it cannot \n\n\n\nbe   concluded   that   he   didn&#x27;t   answer   or   elaborate   any   of   the \n\n\n\nquestion   put   by   the   counsel   for   accused.     It   is   true   that   for \n\n\n\ncertain   questions   he   answered   that   he   has   to   verify   from   the \n\n\n\nrecords   and   for   certain   questions   he   didn&#x27;t   answer   or \n\n\n\nanswered stating that  &quot;he do not  remember&quot;.   It  is relevant \n\n\n\nto point out that he retired from service in March 1985 and he \n\n\n\nwas   called   upon   to   give   evidence   only   in   March   1996   nearly \n\n\n\nafter 15 years of the commissioning of the Idamalayar project. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                      63</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">If we consider all these aspects, there is no reason to reject his \n\n\n\nentire evidence as claimed by the respondents/accused.  In his \n\n\n\nevidence, he has mentioned that on the submission of tender \n\n\n\nby K.P. Poulose, it was noted that he quoted 189% above PAC. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_96\">Agreement submitted by K.P. Poulose has been marked as Ex. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">P-52 and in that Paul Mundakkal was signed as witness.  It is \n\n\n\nfurther   seen   that   as   Chief   Engineer,   he   sent   letters   to   K.P. \n\n\n\nPoulose   and   Kuriakose   who   was   another   persons   submitting \n\n\n\ntenders on 28.07.1982.  He made a note that the tender is not \n\n\n\nin  proper  form  and  it  contains  many  mistakes and  requested \n\n\n\nthem   to   rectify   the   mistakes   within   a   time   schedule.     In   this \n\n\n\nregard, it is useful to refer his categorical statement which, he \n\n\n\ndeposed   before   the   Court   that   &quot;I   considered   it   as   a   special \n\n\ncase because the engineer member Mr. Ramabhadran Nair \n\n\n(A6)   informed   me   that   Mr.   Balakrishna   Pillai   (A1)   has   a \n\n\nspecial   interest   to   award   this   work   to   Mr.   K.P.   Poulose \n\n\n(A4), hence the mistakes happened in the tender should be \n\n\nrectified   with   K.P.Poulose   himself   and   make   a \n\n\ncircumstance to award the work to K.P. Poulose...&quot;   About \n\n\nthe   disqualification   of   tender   offered   by   Kuriakose,   PW-7 \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                     64</span>\n\n\f\ndeposed   the   decision   was   taken   by   a   committee   because   he \n\n\n\ncould not rectify the mistakes as directed by him.  In respect of \n\n\n\na question  put to  PW-7 about  the response  of A6 and  A7,  he \n\n\n\nanswered &quot;they stated that they are happy in disqualifying \n\n\nMr.   Kuriakose&quot;.     It  is   also  seen  from   his   evidence   that   after \n\n\nnoting that the rate quoted  by K.P. Poulose is higher rate, he \n\n\n\nforwarded   the   said   information   for   remarks   of   FA   and   CAO. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">He   also   asserted   that   A6   told   him   that   A1-Minister \n\n\n\nBalakrishna   Pillai   is   very   much   particular   to   award   both   the \n\n\n\nworks   to   K.P.   Poulose.     It   is   further   seen   that   he   highlighted \n\n\n\nthat   without   solving   the   problem   of   tunnel   workers   no \n\n\n\ncontractor can do the work.  According to him, because of this \n\n\n\nreason   he   informed   A6   to   take   steps   to   solve   the   problem   of \n\n\n\nworkers and in fact PW-7 met A6 at his office on 04.11.1982 at \n\n\n\n11:00   a.m.     When   the   issue   relating   to   labour   problem   was \n\n\n\nunder   discussion,   according   to   PW-7,   the   P.A.   of   Board \n\n\n\nChairman   Sankaran   Nair   approched   him   and   informed   that \n\n\n\nMinister   Balakrishna   Pillai   is   willing   to   talk   to   me   through \n\n\n\ntelephone   of   the   Board&#x27;s   Chairman.     In   view   of   the   same, \n\n\n\naccording   to   PW-7,   he   suddenly   entered   into   the   cabin   of \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                      65</span>\n\n\f\nBoard&#x27;s   Chairman   which   is   the   next   room   and   took   the \n\n\n\ntelephone.     He   introduced   himself   through   the   phone   and \n\n\n\naccording   to   PW-7   &quot;A1   asked   him   why   you   were   not \n\n\nrecommended the tenders of Idamalayar tunnel and surge \n\n\nshaft to the Board.  I replied to A1 I am going to talk about \n\n\nit   with   the   contractor   today   and   I   am   having   same \n\n\nproblem   in   this   matter.     There   is   only   one   tender \n\n\nsubmitted by   K.P. Poulose, the rate is very exorbitant, if \n\n\nthe work is awarded without solving the problem of tunnel \n\n\nworkers,   K.P.   Poulose   cannot   start   the   work.     A1   replied \n\n\nthat you don&#x27;t look upon it, K.P. Poulose will purchase all \n\n\nthese   workers,   we   granted   this   higher   rate   for   that   also, \n\n\nhence you recommend the Board to award both the works \n\n\nto K.P. Poulose without any delay.  Then the conversation \n\n\nwas   concluded.     I   immediately   visited   the   room   of   A6.     I \n\n\ntold   to   A6   about   the   call   of   Minister   and   my   reply   and \n\n\ndifficulties.     At   that   time   A6   told   him   that   the   Minister \n\n\ndirectly  asked you, so you do it as he say.&quot;   The following \n\n\nstatement   is   also   relevant   about   the   conduct   of   A1   and   how \n\n\n\nmuch he was interested in awarding contract in favour of K.P. \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                   66</span>\n\n\f\nPaulose.   PW-7 deposed &quot;the face of A1 shows much anger. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">He   explained   A1   that   if   tenders   are   invited   after   solving \n\n\nthe problem of tunnel workers, rate will be reduced, that is \n\n\nprofitable to the Board.  A1 replied with higher anger that \n\n\nI   know   how   to   look   after   the   Board,   I   do   not   want   any \n\n\nadvice   from   your   people,   are   you   approaching   me   with \n\n\nintimate talks, after this, I had no talk anything about it.&quot; \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">It   is   further   seen   that   thereafter   a   note   was   sent   by \n\n\n\nSreedharan   Pillai   and   Unnikrishnan   to   recommend   for \n\n\n\nawarding both the works to K.P. Poulose.  According to him, he \n\n\n\nreceived all the documents as per the direction of A1.  Though, \n\n\n\nseveral reports and minutes of the Board meeting were pressed \n\n\n\ninto service by the respondents/accused in order to strengthen \n\n\n\ntheir   case   that  all   important   decisions   accepting  the   contract \n\n\n\nin   favour   of   K.P.   Poulose   including   several   special   conditions \n\n\n\netc.,   it   is   clear   that   due   to   the   pressure   of   A6,   the   then \n\n\n\nmember   of   the   Board,   who   was   close   to   A1,   as   well   as   the \n\n\n\ndesire of A1 in awarding the contract in favour of K.P. Poulose \n\n\n\nwith higher  rate, PW-7 had no other option except to execute \n\n\n\nthe directions of A6 and A1.       \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                     67</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">38)    Another incident which is relevant about the performance \n\n\n\nof   PW-7   and   response   from   A1   and   A6,   in   his   evidence,   he \n\n\n\nexplained that since the progress of both the works were very \n\n\n\nslow,   he   inspected   the   site   on   23.09.1983.     Due   to   slow \n\n\n\nprogress   in   the   works,   he   castigated   Paul   Mundakkal   who \n\n\n\nconducted the works.  After few days, A3 and Paul Mundakkal \n\n\n\ncame to his house and A3 told him that he is disturbing them \n\n\n\nwithout any reason by way of sending letters and reports, A3 \n\n\n\nfurther warned that if it continues, it will be harmful to them. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_102\">He   also   informed   him   that   the   Minister   agreed   to   avoid \n\n\n\nconcrete lining works of surge shaft but only PW-7 opposed it. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">He also assured that if PW-7 gives his consent, they are ready \n\n\n\nto give anything.   He further explained that he informed them \n\n\n\nthat it is impossible for him because the technical design is his \n\n\n\nduty,   being   a   Chief   Engineer.     After   few   days   from   this \n\n\n\nincident, on 13.10.1983, he was transferred and appointed as \n\n\n\nan   Advisor   of   Electricity   Board   in   respect   of   Hydroelectric \n\n\n\nProjects.   He further explained that such a Post was not there \n\n\n\nand his transfer order was signed and taken on 13.10.1983 at \n\n\n\n8.00   p.m.   in   a   lodge   where   he   was   residing   at \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                   68</span>\n\n\f\nThiruvananthapuram.

After   him,   A2   was   appointed   as   Idamalayar   Chief \n\n\n\nEngineer.  He also informed the Court that he believed that he \n\n\n\nwas   transferred   due   to   the   difference   of   opinion   with   P.K. \n\n\n\nPoulouse, A3 and Paul Mundakkal \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">39)    As regards the decision of the Board and his role, he has \n\n\n\nstated   that   the   Chief   Engineer   has   no   right   to   question   the \n\n\n\nBoard&#x27;s   decision.

The \n\n\n\nquestion   <a href=\"/doc/45896076/\" id=\"a_46\">in   that   case</a>   was   whether   the   NCW   is   competent   or \n\n\n\nentitled   to   file   an   appeal   in   this   Court   against   the   conviction \n\n\n\nand   sentence   imposed   by   the   High   Court.

Though   we \n\n\n\ndiscussed   earlier,   it   is   apt   to   quote   once   again.     During   the \n\n\n\npendency of  the trial before the  special Judge, an application \n\n\n\nfor   withdrawal   of   the   prosecution   only   against   G. \n\n\n\nGopalakrishna Pillai - accused No.5 was made by the Special \n\n\n\nPublic   Prosecutor   on   24.08.1992   under   Section   321   Cr.P.C. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">which was registered as Criminal Appeal No. 79 of 1992 in CC \n\n\n\nNo. 1 of 1991.  The main ground for such withdrawal was that \n\n\n\nwith   the   available   material   successful   prosecution   against   G. \n\n\n\nGopalakrishna   Pillai   -   accused   No.   5   cannot   be   launched, \n\n\n\nhence, the trial against him will be unnecessary and the State \n\n\n\nalso is of that opinion that the prosecution of A-5 may not be \n\n\n\nsustainable.     With   this   information,   the   Special   Public \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                     74</span>\n\n\f\nProsecutor requested that by virtue of provisions contained in \n\n\n\nSection 321 of the CrP.C, necessary consent may be granted to \n\n\n\nwithdraw   the   prosecution   against   the   5th  accused   -   G. \n\n\n\nGopalkrishna   Pillai   and  the   said   accused  may   be   discharged. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">The   Special   Judge   considered   the   issue   at   length   and   after \n\n\n\nanalyzing the entire material and finding that there are enough \n\n\n\nmaterials   to   proceed   against   A-5   refused   to   give   consent   for \n\n\n\nwithdrawal.    This  was taken up by way of  revision before the \n\n\n\nHigh   Court.     The   High   Court   set   aside   the   aforesaid   order \n\n\n\npassed by the Special Judge in the revision filed by the State \n\n\n\nof   Kerala   represented   by   the   Superintendent   of   Police.     The \n\n\n\nsaid   order   of   the   High   Court   was   challenged   by   the   present \n\n\n\nappellant  namely,  V.S.  Achuthanandan,  to  this  Court   by   way \n\n\n\nof special leave petition.   After granting leave, the said special \n\n\n\nleave   petition   was   converted   into   Criminal   Appeal   No.   122   of \n\n\n\n1994.     After   adverting   to   the   elaborate   reasonings   of   the \n\n\n\nspecial Judge and the conclusion of the High Court, this Court \n\n\n\nconcluded   that   &quot;there   was   no   ground   available   to   the   High \n\n\n\nCourt to set aside the well reasoned and justified order of the \n\n\n\nlearned   Special   Judge   rejecting  the   application   of   the   Special \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                   75</span>\n\n\f\nPublic Prosecutor and declining to give consent for withdrawal \n\n\n\nof prosecution.   We may also add that there is nothing in the \n\n\n\nimpugned   order   of   the   High   Court   which   provides   any   legal \n\n\n\nbasis   for   interfering   with   the   aforesaid   order   made   by   the \n\n\n\nSpecial Judge.   The High Court&#x27;s order must obviously be set \n\n\n\naside.&quot;  By setting aside the order of the High Court, this Court \n\n\n\nrestored   the   order   of   the   Special   Judge   and   declined   to   give \n\n\n\nconsent   for   withdrawal   of   the   prosecution   and   permitted   the \n\n\n\nSpecial   Judge   to   proceed   further.     It   is   not   in   dispute   that \n\n\n\nwhen   the   very   same   appellant,   namely,   V.S.   Achuthanandan \n\n\n\nfiled special leave petition and later leave was granted, the very \n\n\n\nsame   respondent-accused   parties   in   the   said   appeal   did   not \n\n\n\nraise   any   objection   as   to   the   maintainability   of   the   appeal   at \n\n\n\nthe   instance   of   V.S.   Achuthanandan.     Further   though   the \n\n\n\nState   has  not  filed   any  appeal   against  the  impugned  order  of \n\n\n\nacquittal   by   the   High   Court   being   arrayed   as   one   of   the \n\n\n\nrespondents   reported   by   a   senior   counsel   to   highlight   its \n\n\n\nstand,   in   fact,   Mr.   R.S.   Sodhi,   learned   senior   counsel   for   the \n\n\n\nState   highlighted   and   supported   the   ultimate   conviction   and \n\n\n\nsentence   imposed   by   the   Special   Judge   and   informed   this \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                     76</span>\n\n\f\nCourt   that   if   this   Court   permits,   they   are   ready   to   file   an \n\n\n\nappeal   with   an   application   for   condonation   of      delay.     While \n\n\n\nappreciating   the   prayer   made   by   Mr.   R.S.   Sodhi,   we   are   not \n\n\n\ninclined to entertain such request at this stage.   However, the \n\n\n\nfact   remains   that   taking   note   of   the   importance   of   the   issue, \n\n\n\nallegations   against   the   Minister   and   higher   officials   of   the \n\n\n\nBoard in respect of award of contract with the ulterior motive, \n\n\n\nthe appellant approached this Court on earlier occasion when \n\n\n\nthe   State   wanted   to   close   the   prosecution   against   all   the \n\n\n\naccused including the Minister based on the order of the High \n\n\n\nCourt in respect of G. Gopalakrishna Pillai, A-5.  Further when \n\n\n\nthe very same appellant filed special leave petition before this \n\n\n\nCourt   and   later     leave   was   granted   by   this   Court   neither   of \n\n\n\nthese   respondents   raised   any   objection   as   to   the \n\n\n\nmaintainability of the petition.  On the other hand, a Bench of \n\n\n\nthree Judges accepted the appellant&#x27;s claim and set aside the \n\n\n\norder   of   the   High   Court   based   on   which   the   Special   Judge \n\n\n\nproceeded further and ultimately convicted and sentenced A-1, \n\n\n\nA-3   and   A-6.     In   view   of   these   factual   details,   learned   senior \n\n\n\ncounsel   for   the   respondents-accused   were   not   serious   in \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                      77</span>\n\n\f\nprojecting   the   issue   relating   to   maintainability   as   their   first \n\n\n\nobjection.     We   hold   that   the   decision   in  NCW&#x27;s   case   (supra) \n\n\n\nwhich was disposed of at the special leave petition stage is not \n\n\n\napplicable to the case on hand.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7447\" id=\"span_80\">46)   For   the  same  reasons,  the  decision  of  this  Court   in  <a href=\"/doc/7447/\" id=\"a_48\">Lalu  \n\n\nPrasad Yadav &amp; Anr.

The facts and figures, in the case on hand, which we \n\n\n\nhave already mentioned clearly show that the contract relates \n\n\n\nto   the   year   1982   and   the   State   Government   initiated \n\n\n\nprosecution   in   1991,   however,   the   trial   prolonged   for   nearly \n\n\n\nnine   years   and   the   Special   Court   passed   an   order   convicting \n\n\n\nthe accused only on 19.11.1999.   When the matter was taken \n\n\n\nup by way of appeal by the accused to the High Court even in \n\n\n\n1999   itself,   the   decision   was   rendered   by   the   High   Court \n\n\n\nacquitting all the accused only in 2003.

We are conscious of the fact that \n\n\n\nthe   Government   of   India,   Department   of   Law   &amp;   Justice   is \n\n\n\nmaking   all   efforts   for   expeditious   disposal   of   cases   of   this \n\n\n\nnature   by   constituting   Special   courts,   however,   the   fact \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                     82</span>\n\n\f\nremains that it takes longer time to reach its destination.   We \n\n\n\nare of the view that when a matter of this nature is entrusted \n\n\n\nto a  Special  Court or  a regular Court, it is but proper  on the \n\n\n\npart   of   the   court   concerned   to   give   priority   to   the   same   and \n\n\n\nconclude the trial within a reasonable time.
