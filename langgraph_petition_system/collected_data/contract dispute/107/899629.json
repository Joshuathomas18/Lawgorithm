Tenderers were \nrequired to submit their tenders to the Assistant Cane \nCommissioner, Udham Singh Nagar, specifying the name of \nthe Sugar Mills from which he wanted to purchase molasses \nand the quantity. The tender had to be accompanied by an \nearnest money of Rs.1,00,000/- in respect of each sugar mill \nfrom which the tenderer wanted to buy molasses.   \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.\tIn response to the tender notice, first respondent and \nothers submitted their tenders, which were opened on \n1.3.2004 at 3.30 PM by the Assistant Cane Commissioner, \nUdham Singh Nagar, in the presence of the General Manager, \nGadarpur, the Purchase Clerk of Sitarganj Mills and Molasses \nClerk of Nadehi Mills. The first respondent&#x27;s tender was for \npurchase of 15,000 quintals of molasses from Kisan Sahakari \nChini Mills Limited, Nadehi, at a price of Rs.101/- per quintal.  \nThe said offer contained a note to the effect that &quot;we will lift \nmolasses in favour of distilleries of UP, Punjab and Haryana&quot;. \nThe first respondent did not enclose any earnest money with \nthe tender, but stated that a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was \nalready deposited with the Nadehi Sugar Mill. The first \nrespondent did not make any offer for purchasing molasses \nfrom the other four mills.  As the prices offered by the \ntenderers were found to be very low, negotiations were held by \nthe Assistant Cane Commissioner with the tenderers on the \nsame day.  This was followed by further negotiations on \n3.3.2004. At the time of negotiations on 3.3.2004, only three \nmembers of the Molasses Sales Committee were present - \nDistrict Magistrate, Udham Singh Nagar, General Manager, \nGadarpur Sugar Mills and the Assistant Cane Commissioner, \nUdham Singh Nagar.

It was also reported that the \nfirst respondent had assured payment of earnest money in \nrespect of each of the four other mills, within seven days if his \noffer was accepted.  The report also stated that the price of Rs. \n127/- per quintal offered by the first respondent was higher \nthan the offer of the other tenderers - IGL (Rs.117/-) and \nRampur Distillery (Rs.126/-).  The Chairman was requested to \nmake his recommendations for accepting the offer of first \nrespondent. The Chairman of Molasses Sales Committee made \nan endorsement &#x27;Seen&#x27; on the said note on 3.3.2004. The \nDistrict Magistrate, Udham Singh Nagar, made a note thereon \nto the effect, &quot;Necessary orders may be issued today itself. \nFirm may deposit earnest money&quot;.

Around that time, the State Government received several \nreports that the prevailing price of molasses was much higher.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">On 06.04.2004, M/s Associated Alchohols and Breweries \nLimited, Jaipur and M/s. Jagjit Industries Limited, \nKapurthala, wrote letters to the District Magistrate, Udham \nSingh Nagar, offering to purchase molasses from the sugar \nmills of Kiccha, Sitarganj, Gadarpur, Nadehi and Doiwala at \nthe rate of Rs.260/- and Rs.250/- per quintal respectively.  \nM/s Uttar Pradesh Sahkari Sugar Mills Sangh Limited, \nLucknow, informed the Government of Uttaranchal by a fax \nmessage that the stock of molasses lying at the co-operative \nsugar mills in the State of U.P. at Sarsawa, Bagpat and Morna \nDistilleries were sold to M/s. Chandigarh Distillers and \nBottlers Limited on 8.4.2004 at the rate of Rs.300/- per \nquintal.   Information was also received that molasses were \nbeing sold by the neighbouring private sector sugar mills in \nUttaranchal at rates ranging from Rs.310/- to Rs.330/- per \nquintal. In view of it, the Additional Secretary, Cane \nDevelopment and Sugar Industries submitted a report to the \nSecretary, Cane Development and Sugar Industries, (for short \n&#x27;Secretary(Sugar)&#x27;) referring to the irregularities in the proposal \nfor supply of 85,000 quintals to first respondent and stating \nthat the six sugar mills would suffer a loss of more than \nRs.1.40 crores if they were required to sell molasses at the rate \nof Rs.127/- per quintal to the first respondent.  The \nSecretary(Sugar), by letter dated 08.04.2004  addressed to the \nfive sugar mills, stayed the operation of the letter dated \n26.03.2004 issued by the Assistant Cane Commissioner \nallotting 85,000 quintals of molasses to first respondent until \nfurther orders.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">10.\tBeing aggrieved, the first respondent filed W.P.(C) \nNo.318/2004 in the High Court praying inter alia to issue \ndirections to the appellants herein (the State Government, \nController of Molasses, Molasses Sale Committee and the five \nSugar Mills) to continue the supply of molasses to him so that \nthe entire allotted quantity of 85,000 quintals could be lifted \non or before 31.05.2004.  It was alleged that the first \nrespondent had already taken delivery of 7465.9 quintals of \nmolasses, from three sugar mills at  Nadehi, Sitarganj, and \nDoiwala and that he had also made all arrangements for \ntaking delivery of the balance stock.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11.  A Division Bench of the High Court, by interim order \ndated 19.04.2004, directed the State Government to take a \ndecision on the claim of first respondent after giving hearing  \nwithin 10 days. Pending such decision, the High Court \npermitted the first respondent to lift upto 20,000 quintals of \nmolasses.  The High Court also directed that the writ petition \nbe listed on 29.04.2004 for final hearing and disposal.    \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12.\tBy order dated 20.04.2004, the State Government \ndissolved the earlier Molasses Sale Committee and in its place \nreconstituted a fresh Molasses Sale Committee.

Thereafter, on \ndue and proper consideration of the material on record, the \nSecretary (Sugar), passed a detailed order dated 24.04.2004,  \nholding that there was no valid  contract for supply of \nmolasses to first respondent and therefore the allotment letter \ndated 26.3.2004 was without any authority and consequently \ncancelled the said allotment letter issued by the Assistant \nCane Commissioner allotting 85,000 quintals of molasses to \nthe first respondent. The findings on the basis of which he \ncancelled the allotment letter dated 26.3.2004 are extracted \nbelow : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">&quot;(i)\tThat as per notice published on 23.2.2004 in \nAmar Ujala newspaper the tenders were invited \nfrom bona fide consumers and it was a compulsory \ncondition to deposit Rs.1 lac earnest money with the \ntender.

The remark on the aforesaid \nnegotiation form given by the above firm that they \nare ready to lift the molasses of other sugar \nfactories on this rate if their rates are approved by \nthe Committee, in that case they are ready to \ndeposit within one week. This condition is not \nacceptable in accordance to law because the \nconditional tenders are liable for cancellation. The \ntender opening form dated 1.3.2004 and the \nnegotiation form dated 3.3.2004 contains the \nsignature of General Manager, Sugar Mills, \nGadarpur, Molasses Clerk, Sitarganj, Purchase \nClerk and Assistant Cane Commissioner.

Moreover, the General \nManagers of these mills who were also the members \nwere not present in the Committee meeting on \n1.3.2004 and 3.3.2004 so the sale of molasses of \nthese mills is not in accordance to the law. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">(iv)\tThe Assistant Cane Commissioner&#x27;s letter \ndated 26.3.2004 which is originally written to M/s \nVardan Linkers, Bijnor contains the details of M/s \nPatiala Distilleries and Manufactureres and M/s \nChandigarh Distillers to whom the molasses is sold \n@ Rs.127 per quintal but M/s Vardan Linkers did \nnot disclose their names in its tender form. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">Moreover, on 1.3.2004 at the time of tender \nsubmission and on 3.3.2004 at the time of \nnegotiation there were no authorization letters in \nfavour of M/s Vardan Linkers of these two distillers \nfrom which it is very clear that M/s Vardan Linkers \nis not a bona fide purchaser.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">(v)\tThat in condition no.9 of the tender form it is \nclearly mentioned that no person will transport the \nmolasses in Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh and out \nof these States without the prior permission of \nController of Molasses M/s Vardan Linkers has \nenclosed with its writ petition as Annexure No.1 and \n2 which are the No Objection Certificate of Excise \nand Taxation Commissioner, Patiala dated \n16.3.2004 issued in favour of M/s Patiala Distiller \nand Manufacturer and &#x27;No Objection Certificate&#x27; \ndated 12.3.2004 issued in favour of Chandigarh \nDistillers and Bottlers, from which it is clearly \nevident that on 1.3.2004 on the date of submission \nof tenders and on 3.3.2004 at the time of \nnegotiation they have no such certificate. No \ndocument has been produced about the approval of \nController of Molasses. From this it is clear that \neven on compliance of this condition the tender was \nnot acceptable. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">(vi)\tFrom the information obtained from the sugar \nmills it has been observed that the letter dated \n26.3.2004 issued by Assistant Cane Commissioner \nfor sale of molasses in favour of M/s Vardan Linkers \nwas only submitted in the mills by the \nrepresentative during the period 6.4.2004 to \n8.4.2004 of M/s Vardan Linkers and they lifted the \nmolasses during this period. During this period \nanother firm M/s Jagjit Industries, Kapurthala and \nanother firm M/s  Associated Alcohol and Breweries \nLimited vide its fax letter dated 6.4.2004 offered its \nrates @ Rs.250 and Rs.260 per quintal respectively \nfor molasses. The submission of alleged letter dated \n26.3.2004 of Assistant Cane Commissioner issued a \nletter in favour of M/s Vardan Linkers and its \nsubmission and its submission by its representative \nin the mills during the period 6.4.2004 to 8.4.2004 \ncreates doubt and question mark, and by this act it \ncreates loss of Rs.1.40 crores to the mills of State of \nUttaranchal.

As such \nwithout any valid contract with the mill of State of \nUttaranchal to sale the molasses @ Rs.127 per \nquintal to M/s Vardan Linkers is against the rules.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">13.\tBeing aggrieved by the interim direction dated 19.4.2004 \nto supply 20,000 quintals of molasses to the first respondent, \nthe appellants approached this Court.

It also \nextended the time for lifting the molasses by a period \nequivalent to the number of days between 24.4.2004 and \n31.5.2004, that is one month and seven days.

The decision was challenged by \nthe first respondent in the writ petition by contending that the \nallotment letter dated 26.3.2004 authorizing him to lift 85,000 \nquintals of molasses was in pursuance of a concluded contract \nfor sale of such molasses and therefore the decision of staying \nthe operation of the allotment letter was invalid and illegal. \nThe initial prayer in the writ petition was for a direction to \n&#x27;continue the supply of molasses so that entire allotted \nquantity of 85,000 quintals of molasses could be lifted on or \nbefore 31.5.2004&#x27;. As the order dated 8.4.2004 of the  \nSecretary (Sugar), staying the allotment letter was pending, \nthe High Court in the meantime issued an interim direction to \nthe State Government to hold inquiry in the matter after giving \nhearing to the first respondent.  Accordingly, the Secretary \n(Sugar), held an inquiry and passed a detailed order dated \n24.4.2004 giving the instances of irregularities committed by \nthe Assistant Cane Commissioner and others and held that \nthere was no concluded or valid contract and that the \nallotment letter dated 26.3.2004 was as a result of  collusion \nbetween the first respondent and the Assistant Cane \nCommissioner and the District Magistrate and, therefore, \ncancelled the allotment letter dated 26.3.2004.  In other \nwords, the Secretary (Sugar), held that as there was no \ncontract at all, therefore, the Assistant Cane Commissioner \ncould not have issued a letter of allotment permitting the first \nrespondent to lift 85,000 quintals of molasses. When the said \norder was passed, the first respondent amended the writ \npetition and included a prayer &#x27;for quashing the order of \ncancellation dated 24.4.2004&#x27;, contending that the \ncancellation order was illegal and arbitrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">17.\tIf the dispute was considered as purely one relating to \nexistence of an agreement, that is, whether there was a \nconcluded contract and whether the cancellation and \nconsequential non-supply amounted to breach of such \ncontract, the first respondent ought to have approached the \nCivil Court for damages.  On the other hand, when a writ \npetition was filed in regard to the said contractual dispute, the \nissue was whether the Secretary (Sugar), had acted arbitrarily \nor unreasonably, in staying the operation of the allotment \nletter dated 26.3.2004 or subsequently cancelling the \nallotment letter. In a civil suit, the emphasis is on the \ncontractual right. In a writ petition, the focus shifts to the \nexercise of power by the authority, that is whether the order of \ncancellation dated 24.4.2004 passed by the Secretary (Sugar), \nwas arbitrary or unreasonable.  The issue whether there was a \nconcluded contract and breach thereof becomes secondary. In \nexercising writ jurisdiction, if the High Court found that the \nexercise of power in passing an order of cancellation was not \narbitrary and unreasonable, it should normally desist from \ngiving any finding on disputed or complicated questions of fact \nas to whether there was a contract, and relegate the petitioner \nto the remedy of a civil suit. Even in cases where the High \nCourt finds that there is a valid contract, if the impugned \nadministrative action by which the contract is cancelled, is not \nunreasonable or arbitrary, it should still refuse to interfere \nwith the same, leaving the aggrieved party to work out his \nremedies in a Civil Court. In other words, when there is a \ncontractual dispute with a public law element, and a party \nchooses the public law remedy by way of a writ petition \ninstead of a private law remedy of a suit, he will not get a full \nfledged adjudication of his contractual rights, but only a \njudicial review of the administrative action. The question \nwhether there was a contract and whether there was a breach \nmay, however, be examined incidentally while considering the \nreasonableness of the administrative action. But where the \nquestion whether there was a contract, is seriously disputed, \nthe High Court cannot assume that there was a valid contract \nand on that basis, examine the validity of the administrative \naction. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">18.\tIn this case, the question that arose for consideration in \nthe writ petition was whether the order dated 24.4.2004 \npassed by the Secretary (Sugar), cancelling the allotment letter \ndated 26.3.2004 was arbitrary and irrational or violative of any \nadministrative law principles. The question whether there was \na concluded contract or not, was only incidental to the \nquestion as to whether cancellation order dated 24.4.2004 by \nthe Secretary (Sugar), was justified.  As the case involved \nseveral disputed questions in regard to the existence of the \ncontract itself, the High Court ought to have referred the first \nrespondent to a Civil Court. But the High Court in exercise of \nits writ jurisdiction, proceeded as if it was dealing with a pure \nand simple civil suit relating to breach of contract.   When \ncertain disputed facts cropped up, the High Court adopted a \nstrange procedure of calling the General Managers of Sitarganj \nSugar Mills and Nadehi Sugar Mills and putting some \nquestions to them and recording their statements. The High \nCourt reached the conclusion that there was a concluded \ncontract between the five sugar mills and the first respondent \nfor sale of 85,000 quintal of molasses at a price of Rs.127/- \nper quintal. Thereafter, it formulated the question for \nconsideration in the writ petition as &#x27;whether the State \nGovernment was competent to cancel the valid and completed \ncontract&#x27;, and held that having regard to the doctrines of part \nperformance, legitimate expectation, estoppel and \nacquiescence, the cancellation of the allotment letter dated \n26.3.2004 issued by the Assistant Cane Commissioner was \nunsustainable and the first respondent was entitled to lift the \nentire quantity of 85,000 quintal (less 7,465.9 quintal already \nlifted), and he was also entitled to extension of time for taking \ndelivery by one month and seven days from the date of the \njudgment.  In this view of the matter, two questions arise for \nour consideration. They are :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">(i)  \tWhether the High Court was right in \nconcluding/assuming that there was a valid contract?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(ii)   Whether the High Court was justified in quashing the \ncancellation order dated 24.4.2004 passed by Secretary, \n(Sugar)?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">Re:  Question (i)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">19.\tBefore a court can record a finding as to whether there is \na contract, it has to find out who are the parties to the \ncontract, when and what was the offer, whether there was an \nacceptance, and whether the offer and acceptance were valid. \nNone of these were addressed nor answered by the High Court. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">20.\tWe extract below the averments made in the writ petition \nto contend that there is a concluded contract :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">&quot;That aforesaid tenders were opened on 1.3.2004 at \nthe office of Assistant Cane Commissioner, Udham \nSingh Nagar. The Assistant Cane Commissioner \nalso happens to be the Secretary of the Committee. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">That subsequently thereafter all the prospective \nallottees (who had submitted their tenders) were \ninvited by the Committee and tenders were opened \nand in an open meeting, the bidders were asked to \nincrease the bids and negotiations took place and \npetitioner being highest as Rs.127 per quintal was \naccepted. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">That at this junction, the deponent has been \nadvised to state that once the bid of the petitioner \nwas accepted by the authorized Committee for a \ncertain price which was Rs.127 per quintal, it \namounts to valid contract as it has all the \ningredients of a valid contract, namely, offer, \nacceptance and consideration.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">Thus, the case of first respondent is that there was a \nconcluded contract - that is acceptance of his offer on \n3.3.2004, when the negotiations took place.  But in paras 17 \nand 19 of the writ petition, the first respondent alleged that \nthe contract was concluded when the letter dated 26.3.2004 \nwas issued by the Assistant Cane Commissioner permitting \nhim to lift 85,000 quintals of molasses and the said letter \ndated 26.3.2004 was a &#x27;agreement&#x27; between the parties. This \nambiguity as to whether the contract came into existence on \n3.3.2004 or 26.3.2004 was not even referred to by the High \nCourt in the impugned order.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">21.\tLet us next examine as to who was the purchaser. The \ntender notice made it clear that only bona fide consumers \n(that is, actual users) could make the offer. Admittedly, the \nfirst respondent did not have a distillery or manufacturing \nunit and was not a &#x27;consumer&#x27; of molasses. He was a transport \ncontractor. Even the allotment letter dated 26.3.2004 shows \nthat the first respondent was not the &#x27;consumer - purchaser&#x27;. \nTherefore, first respondent could not be the purchaser. Let us \nconsider whether Patiala Distillers and Chandigarh Distillers, \nwho were shown as the persons who will take deliveries in the \nletter dated 26.3.2004, were the purchasers. They did not \nmake any offer. Nor was any offer made on their behalf. There \nwas no acceptance addressed to them. There was no \nagreement or contract with them. They did not seek delivery \nnor did they join the first respondent as petitioners in the writ \npetition. They were not therefore the &#x27;purchasers&#x27;.  If neither \nfirst respondent, nor Patiala Distillers/Chandigarh Distillers \ncould be the purchaser, who was the bona fide consumer who \ncould claim performance?  The question remains unanswered.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">22.\tThe tenders were invited for sale of molasses by five \nindependent sugar mills.  The tenderers were required to pay \nRs.1,00,000/- as earnest money, in respect of each sugar mill \nfrom which the tenderer intended to purchase molasses.  The \nfive sugar mills were different legal entities. Two of them were \nGovernment companies incorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_7\">Companies Act</a> \nand the remaining three were independent co-operative sugar \nmills. The tender notice and the tender documents would \nmake it clear that though the tender notice was common, the \ntenderers were required to make separate offers in regard to \nmolasses to be purchased from each sugar mill showing the \nquantity which they wanted to purchase from each sugar mill \nand the price which they were willing to pay and also to pay \nseparate earnest money deposit. The first respondent did not \nmake any offer except in the case of Nadehi Sugar Mill, even \nthat was not accompanied by the earnest money deposit. He \nclaims to have made an endorsement in the tender form on \n3.3.2004, that if his rate was accepted, he was ready to lift the \nentire quantity of molasses from the five factories. But neither \nthe original offer nor the alleged extension of the offer on \n3.3.2004 was accompanied by any earnest money deposit. \nThere was therefore no valid offer as on 3.3.2004. Nor was \nthere any acceptance by the Molasses Sales Committee or any \nof the sugar mills on 3.3.2004. There was also no acceptance \neven by the three Members of the Molasses Sales Committee \non 3.3.2004. This is evident from the fact that after the \nnegotiations meeting, a report was submitted by the Three \nMembers of the Committee to the Chairman referring to the \noffer of first respondent seeking his approval for their proposal \nto sell the molasses of the other Mills to the first respondent.  \nTherefore, it could not be said that there was a concluded or \nbinding contract for sale or supply of molasses by any of the \nfive mills on 3.3.2004. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">23.\tIt is admitted that the first respondent did not make any \noffer in the prescribed form of tender in regard to the molasses \nof the other four mills (Gadarpur, Doiwala, Sitarganj and \nKitcha).  On 3.3.2004 when negotiations were held between \nthe first respondent and three members of the Committee, the \nfirst respondent appears to have expressed his interest to \npurchase the molasses of all the mills at a price of Rs.127/- \nper quintal and made an endorsement to that effect in his \ntender form. First respondent claims to have paid \nRs.4,00,000/- as earnest money deposit in respect of four \nmills under cover of letter dated 10.3.2004. But thereafter \nthere was no meeting of the Molasses Sales Committee nor \nany acceptance of first respondent&#x27;s offer. Neither the act of \nputting up a proposal by the Assistant Cane Commissioner or \nthe District Magistrate for consideration by the Chairman of \nthe Molasses Sales Committee nor the alleged approval of the \nrecommendation for sale by the Chairman of the Molasses \nSales Committee will lead to a binding contract as there was \nno decision by Molasses Sales Committee to accept the offer. \nTherefore, on this count as well, there was no concluded \ncontract. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">24.\tIn this case, the first allotment by the Assistant Cane \nCommissioner was on 15.3.2004 permitting the first \nrespondent to lift 5000 quintals from Nadehi Mills at Rs.127/- \nper quintals.  This was wholly illegal as it was not in \npursuance of any concluded contract and as first respondent \nwas not a bona fide consumer. The first respondent submitted \nthe authorization letter from the Patiala Distillers and the \nChandigarh Distillers only on 14.3.2004.  If there was already \na concluded contract with the first respondent on 3.3.2004, \nthere could not have been any change in the contract by \nsubmitting an authorization letter from Patiala Distillers and \nChandigarh Distillers on 14.3.2004.  There was also no \ncorrespondence or negotiations subsequent to 3.3.2004 to \nshow that any contract was concluded in favour of Patiala \nDistillers or Chandigarh Distillers.  Therefore, when the letter \ndated 26.3.2004 was issued by the Assistant Cane \nCommissioner authorizing the first respondent to lift 85,000 \nquintals of molasses it was not in pursuance of any concluded \ncontract but was unilateral unauthorized act on the part of the \nAssistant Cane Commissioner which would not bind the State \nGovernment.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">25.\tThe tender notice clearly specified that only bona fide \nconsumers could make an offer.  In his tender, the first \nrespondent claimed that he was making an offer as a bona fide \nconsumer, that is, as an actual user of molasses.  The tender \ndid not mention that he was making the offer as an agent of \nother consumers nor did he disclose the names of any \nconsumers on whose behalf he was making the offer.  He \nmerely made a vague and sweeping statement that he will lift \nmolasses in favour of distilleries of U.P., Punjab and Haryana.  \nThis showed that he was not acting for any specific principal. \nFurther having regard to the requirement that sale will be only \nto bona fide consumers, the offer ought to have disclosed the \nnames of the Principal and his authority to make the offer on \ntheir behalf, if he was making an offer on behalf of anyone \nelse. Further, the required Certificate from the Excise \nCommissioner/Controller of Sugar that the purchaser was a \nbona fide consumer, ought to have been enclosed.  For all \nthese reasons, therefore, there could not be any valid contract \nwith first respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">26.\tThe order dated 25.3.2003 constituting the Molasses \nSales Committee made it clear that molasses could be sold \nonly by the said Committee.  This meant that the Molasses \nSales Committee would identify and decide upon the \npurchaser, as also the terms of sales including the price. But \nthe Molasses Sales Committee by itself was not the seller but \nonly the authority entrusted with the task of finalizing the \nsales and the seller were the sugar mills themselves.  The \nCommittee consisted of nine members with Commissioner of \nKumaon Mandal as Chairman, the District Magistrate, Udham \nSingh Nagar and the General Managers of the six sugar mills \nas members and the Assistant Cane Commissioner, Udham \nSingh Nagar, as the Member-Secretary. Admittedly, the nine \nmembers of the Committee were not present either on \n1.3.2004 when the tenders were opened or on 3.3.2004 when \nthe alleged negotiations were held. The tenders were opened \non 1.3.2004 by the Assistant Cane Commissioner, who was \nthe Secretary of the Committee. No meeting of the Committee \nhad been called on 3.3.2004. The persons who were present in \nthe alleged negotiation meeting were the District Magistrate, \nUdham Singh Nagar and only the General Manager of \nGodarpur Sugar Mills, apart from the Member-Secretary. The \nChief Accountant of Sitarganj Sugar Mills who was present \n,cannot be considered to be a member of the Committee. The \nGeneral Managers of other four mills were not present nor was \nthe Chairman of the Committee present. Three members did \nnot constitute the quorum for the Committee. Nor did the \nCommittee authorize three members to finalise the sale of \nmolasses. It cannot therefore, be said that the negotiations \nheld on 3.3.2004 were held by the Molasses Sales Committee \nor authorized members of the said Committee. In fact, the \nMolasses Sales Committee never considered the offer of first \nrespondent, nor accepted its offer. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">27.\tThe communication dated 26.3.2004 from the Assistant \nCane Commissioner to the first respondent whereby and \nwhereunder the first respondent was permitted  to lift 85,000 \nquintals of molasses from the five sugar mills, did not refer to \nany decision by the Molasses Sales Committee to sell molasses \nto the first respondent. It referred only to the negotiations held \non 3.3.2004 and stated that &quot;on the approval of \nCommissioner, Kumaon Mandal&quot;, first respondent was \npermitted to lift 85,000 quintals of molasses. The \nCommissioner, Kumaon Mandal was not the authority \nempowered to effect the sale of molasses.  In the absence of \nany contract under which the five sugar mills agreed to sell \n85,000 quintals in all to the first respondent at a price of \nRs.127 per quintal, the question of Assistant Cane \nCommissioner permitting the first respondent to lift 85,000 \nquintals of molasses did not arise.  The letter dated 26.3.2004 \nsent by Assistant Cane Commissioner cannot therefore, be \nconsidered to be a contract for supply of 85,000 quintals of \nmolasses to the first respondent. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">28.\tThus, there was no material before the High Court to \nassume or come to the conclusion that there was a concluded \ncontract for supply of 85,000 quintals of molasses.              \nRe : Question (ii) :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">29.\tLet us now examine whether the Secretary (Sugar), was \njustified in issuing the order dated 24.4.2004 cancelling the \norder dated 26.3.2004 and whether the High Court was \njustified in questioning the order of the Secretary (Sugar).   \nThe order dated 24.4.2004, passed by the Secretary (Sugar) \nholding that the first respondent did not have any valid \ncontract for supply of molasses and it had no right to enforce \nthe letter dated 26.3.2004 issued by the Assistant Cane \nCommissioner was perfectly valid and justified. We have \nalready held that the decision of the Secretary, Sugar that \nthere was no concluded contract for sale of any molasses in \nfavour of first respondent or his nominee is correct and does \nnot suffer from any infirmity or perversity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">30.\tThe first respondent does not dispute that 70% of the \nmolasses were earmarked for supply to distilleries and \nchemical factories in the State of Uttaranchal and 10% for \nmanufacturers of country-liquor in the State and only 20% \nwas earmarked for use by bona fide consumers, that is \ndistilleries and chemical factories outside the State. Obviously, \nthe price fore sale to each category would be different. The \nprice at which 70% is sold to the distilleries and chemical \nfactories within the State will normally be less than the price \nat which 20% is sold to distilleries or chemical factories \noutside the State. The tenders were invited in regard to the \nquota earmarked for bona fide consumers where distilleries \nand chemical factories outside the State could participate. In \nspite of it, the District Magistrate, Udham Singh Nagar, \nprepared a note for the attention of the Chairman of the \nCommittee wherein he referred to the price of Rs.117/- per \nquintal at which molasses were being sold to IGL which was a \ndistillery within the State covered by 70% local quota, to \njustify the sale of molasses to the first respondent under 20% \noutside quota though it was not a bona fide consumer at a \nprice of RS.127/-  per quintal. The note neither mentioned the \nfact of the quantities to be sold nor the fact that the first \nrespondent had not produced any certificate either from the \nCane Commissioner or from the Excise Department to show \nthat it was a bona fide consumer of molasses. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">31.\tThe tender notice made it clear that only bona fide \nconsumers of molasses could make offers. The first \nrespondent is a proprietary concern carrying on transport \nbusiness at Bijnor in the State of Uttar Pradesh but the tender \nwas submitted by the first respondent in the name and style of  \n&quot;Vardan Linkers, Bijnor being bona fide consumer registered \nindustrial unit.&quot;  The note added at the end of the tender \nstated that &quot;we shall lift molasses in favour of distillery of UP, \nPunjab and Haryana&quot;. If first respondent was to lift the \nmolasses for other units, it was admittedly not a bona fide \nconsumer.  Only on 14.3.2004, the first respondent produced \nauthorization letters showing him as authorized agent of \nPatiala Distillers and Manufacturers Ltd., Patiala and \nChandigarh Distillers and Bottlers Ltd., Patiala. On the basis \nof those letters, the first respondent requested for delivery of \n45000 quintals (that is 15000 quintals each from Nadehi, \nGadarpur and Doiwala Sugar Mills) to Patiala Distillers and \n40,000 quintals (15,000 quintals from Sitarganj Mills and \n25,000 quintals from Kiccha Mills) to Chandigarh Distillers. \nThough the tender was opened on 1.3.2004, the first \nrespondent did not disclose till 14.3.2004 that he was \nsubmitting the tender on behalf of the above said two distillers \nin the State of Punjab. Thus, it was clear that the offer was \nmade not by first respondent as a bona fide consumer but as a \nnon-consumer trader. Therefore, there was no valid offer at all \nby the first respondent. The Assistant Cane Commissioner was \nfully aware that first respondent was not a bona fide \nconsumer, he was also aware of the prevailing sale prices in \nregard to molasses to be sold to bona fide consumers outside \nthe State at much higher prices than what was offered by first \nrespondent, and also of the fact that the price for the sale of \nmolasses to consumers within the State was much less than \nthe rate for sale of molasses to bona fide consumers outside \nthe State, he proceeded to negotiate with the first respondent \ntaking only one more member (District Magistrate) into \nconfidence. The manner in which the entire matter was \nproceeded with, showed collusion between the first respondent \non one hand and the District Magistrate, Udham Singh Nagar \nand the Assistant Cane Commissioner, Udham Singh Nagar on \nthe other hand, to dispose of large quantities of valuable \nmolasses at a throw-away price without proper negotiations \nand without valid authority from the Molasses Sales \nCommittee to a party who was not entitled to purchase \nmolasses as a bona fide purchaser. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">32.\tThe various serious irregularities were noticed by the \nSecretary (Sugar) in his detailed and reasoned order dated \n24.4.2004 and resultantly, he directed cancellation of the \nletter dated 26.3.2004 issued by the Assistant Cane \nCommissioner which permitted the first respondent to lift \n85,000 quintal of molasses from five mills. He also held that \nthere was no valid contract. In the facts and circumstances, \nnarrated hereinabove,  it is not legally possible to hold that the \norder dated 24.4.2004 was either arbitrary or unreasonable or \nmala fide. It was fully justified and in public interest. If the \norder dated 24.4.2004 did not suffer from an infirmity which \nrequired correction by application of principles of \nAdministrative Law, the High Court ought not to have \ninterfered with it. There was, apparently, no justification for \ninvoking the principles of legitimate expectations, estoppel, \nacquiescence and principle of part performance to make out a \ncontract, where none existed or to give directions to five \nindependent sugar mills to supply huge quantifies of molasses \nto first respondent without any contract at an admittedly low \nprice of Rs.127/- per quintal \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">33.\tWe, therefore, allow these appeals and set aside the \njudgment dated 28.7.2007 passed by the High Court of \nUttaranchal in WP No.318(N/B) of 2004 and dismiss the writ \npetition. We direct the first respondent to pay costs of \nRs.10,000/- in each appeal (in all Rs.30,000/-) to the \nappellants. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">34.\tThis Court, by interim orders dated 23.8.2004 and \n10.9.2004, had permitted the first respondent to lift in all \n15,000 quintals of molasses from Nadehi Mills. Though the \nfirst respondent is not entitled to it, not being a bona fide \nconsumer, if the supplies have already been effected and paid \nfor, the issue of supply to that extent may be treated as closed. \n</p>","numcites":6,"numcitedby":233,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":899629,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":" breach of contracts","formInput":"%20breach%20of%20contracts"},{"value":"valid contract","formInput":"valid%20contract"},{"value":"concluded contract","formInput":"concluded%20contract"},{"value":"kichha sugars","formInput":"kichha%20sugars"},{"value":"offer and acceptance","formInput":"offer%20and%20acceptance"},{"value":"public law remedy","formInput":"public%20law%20remedy"},{"value":"earnest money","formInput":"earnest%20money"},{"value":"allotment letter","formInput":"allotment%20letter"},{"value":"kisan sahkari chini mills ltd","formInput":"kisan%20sahkari%20chini%20mills%20ltd"},{"value":"what is administrative action","formInput":"what%20is%20administrative%20action"},{"value":"molasses ","formInput":"molasses%20"},{"value":"\" there is no concluded contract\"","formInput":"%22%20there%20is%20no%20concluded%20contract%22"},{"value":"writ jurisdiction","formInput":"writ%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"collusion","formInput":"collusion"},{"value":"tender opening","formInput":"tender%20opening"},{"value":"tender notice","formInput":"tender%20notice"},{"value":"mala fides","formInput":"mala%20fides"},{"value":"earnest","formInput":"earnest"},{"value":"\"concluded contract\"","formInput":"%22concluded%20contract%22"},{"value":"Not a consumer","formInput":"Not%20a%20consumer"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"},{"value":"companies-law","formInput":"tag:companies-law"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
