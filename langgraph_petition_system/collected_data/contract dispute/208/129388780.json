At the same time, in para 85 of the Award, the Tribunal\n\nfurther held that after issuance of the prohibition notification\n\ndated 17th March, 1993 in the instant case, the principal\n\nemployer(SAIL) was prohibited to employ any contract labour in\n\nany process, operation or other work in the establishment and\n\nwhen     the   contract    with   the    contractors     after    prohibition\n\nnotification became void and not genuine and the extension of\n\nthe period of contract of the respective contractors which has\n\nbeen allowed to continue in the establishment by operation of law\n\nbecame ab­initio void and sham and bogus.                  Para 85 of the\n\nAward is as under:­\n\n\n          “85.     It is an established fact that the notification\n          dated 7­3­93 came to the effect prohibiting the\n          employment of contract labours from the date of its\n          publication. As such, in the light of the constitutional\n          bench judgment in SAIL versus National Water Front\n          Workers Union &amp; others (Supra) the contract of\n          Principal employer with contractor in regard to the\n          contract labour comes to an end beyond shadow of\n          doubts and the contract with regard to the contract\n          labours subsequently after the notification dated 17­3­\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                           12</span>\n\f        1993 becomes not genuine.

It is evident that when the contract of\n        the contractors after notification became itself void and\n        not genuine, the extension of the period of contract of\n        the respective contractors would be ab­initio void and\n        sham and bogus. Thus it is established that the\n        contract of Principal employer with contractors in\n        regard to the contract labours became subsequently\n        sham and bogus after the notification No. S.O. 707\n        dated 17­3­1993 coming into the effect from the date of\n        its publication.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">15.

Sh. Ranjit Kumar and Sh. Parag P.

Learned   counsel     further   submits   that   normally   the\n\nindustrial adjudicator is the final Court of facts and on its\n\nextensive discussion based on the material available on record, it\n\nwas held that there is no employer and employee relationship\n\nbetween the appellant and respondent workmen and, therefore,\n\nthe question of compliance of <a href=\"/doc/539839/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 25(n)</a> of the Act does not\n\narise and it was the contractor who had terminated their services\n\nin April 1996 and it was the contractor who had full control and\n\nsupervision over the work of the labourers.

The High Court on appraisal of the\n\nevidence recorded its satisfaction on all the tests cumulatively\n\nand rightly held that the contract between the contract labour\n\nand the contractor was sham and bogus and once the finding has\n\nbeen recorded under the impugned judgment, the consequence is\n\nrestoring the relationship of the principal employer and of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                20</span>\n\fcontract labour as an employer and employee and this makes the\n\nrespondent entitled for their regularisation of service and the\n\ndifference of salary which has been paid to their counterparts\n\nwho were regular in employment of the appellant establishment\n\nwhich indeed could not have been denied to the respondent.

Before we may advert to examine the question in the instant\n\nappeals any further, it will be apposite to take note of the legal\n\neffect of the prohibition notification issued by the appropriate\n\nGovernment in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 10(1)</a> of the CLRA\n\nAct and its exposition by the Constitution Bench of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_52\">Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others</a> (supra) overruling the\n\njudgment in <a href=\"/doc/784921/\" id=\"a_53\">Air India Statutory Corporation and Others</a>\n\n(supra).

We have extracted above <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA\nAct which empowers the appropriate Government to\nprohibit employment of contract labour in any process,\noperation or other work in any establishment, lays\ndown the procedure and specifies the relevant factors\nwhich shall be taken into consideration for issuing\nnotification under sub­section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 10</a>. It is a\ncommon ground that the consequence of prohibition\nnotification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 10(1)</a> of the CLRA Act,\nprohibiting employment of contract labour, is neither\nspelt out in <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 10</a> nor indicated anywhere in the\nAct. In our view, the following consequences follow on\nissuing a notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 10(1)</a> of the CLRA\nAct:</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">    (1)   contract     labour    working    in the\n    establishment concerned at the time of issue\n    of notification will cease to function;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">    (2) the contract of principal employer with the\n    contractor in regard to the contract labour\n    comes to an end;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">    (3) no contract labour can be employed by\n    the principal employer in any process,\n    operation or other work in the establishment\n    to which the notification relates at any time\n    thereafter;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">    (4) the contract labour is not rendered\n    unemployed as is generally assumed but\n    continues in the employment of the\n    contractor as the notification does not sever\n    the relationship of master and servant\n    between the contractor and the contract\n    labour;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">    (5) the contractor can utilise the services of\n    the    contract   labour    in    any    other\n    establishment in respect of which no\n    notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 10(1)</a> has been\n    issued where all the benefits under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_61\">CLRA\n    Act</a> which were being enjoyed by it, will be\n    available;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                            25</span>\n\f     (6) if a contractor intends to retrench his\n     contract labour, he can do so only in\n     conformity with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_62\">ID Act</a>.\n\nThe point now under consideration is: whether\nautomatic absorption of contract labour working in an\nestablishment, is implied in <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA Act\nand follows as a consequence on issuance of the\nprohibition notification thereunder. We shall revert to\nthis aspect shortly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">88. If we may say so, the eloquence of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_64\">CLRA Act</a> in\nnot spelling out the consequence of abolition of\ncontract labour system, discerned in the light of\nvarious reports of the Commissions and the\nCommittees and the Statement of Objects and Reasons\nof the Act, appears to be that Parliament intended to\ncreate a bar on engaging contract labour in the\nestablishment covered by the prohibition notification,\nby a principal employer so as to leave no option with\nhim except to employ the workers as regular employees\ndirectly. <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 10</a> is intended to work as a permanent\nsolution to the problem rather than to provide a one­\ntime measure by departmentalizing the existing\ncontract labour who may, by a fortuitous circumstance\nbe in a given establishment for a very short time as on\nthe date of the prohibition notification. It could as well\nbe that a contractor and his contract labour who were\nwith an establishment for a number of years were\nchanged just before the issuance of prohibition\nnotification. In such a case there could be no\njustification to prefer the contract labour engaged on\nthe relevant date over the contract labour employed for\na longer period earlier. These may be some of the\nreasons as to why no specific provision is made for\nautomatic absorption of contract labour in the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_66\">CLRA\nAct</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">105. The principle that a beneficial legislation needs to\nbe construed liberally in favour of the class for whose\nbenefit it is intended, does not extend to reading in the\nprovisions of the Act what the legislature has not\nprovided whether expressly or by necessary\nimplication, or substituting remedy or benefits for that\nprovided by the legislature. We have already noticed\nabove the intendment of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_67\">CLRA Act</a> that it regulates\nthe conditions of service of the contract labour and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                             26</span>\n\fauthorizes in <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 10(1)</a> prohibition of contract\nlabour system by the appropriate Government on\nconsideration of factors enumerated in sub­section (2)\nof <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 10</a> of the Act among other relevant factors.\nBut, the presence of some or all those factors, in our\nview, provides no ground for absorption of contract\nlabour on issuing notification under sub­section (1) of\n<a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 10</a>. Admittedly, when the concept of automatic\nabsorption of contract labour as a consequence of\nissuing notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 10(1)</a> by the\nappropriate Government, is not alluded to either in\n<a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 10</a> or at any other place in the Act and the\nconsequence of violation of <a href=\"/doc/1711982/\" id=\"a_73\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/476610/\" id=\"a_74\">12</a> of the\nCLRA Act is explicitly provided in <a href=\"/doc/790314/\" id=\"a_75\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/539839/\" id=\"a_76\">25</a>\nof the CLRA Act, it is not for the High Courts or this\nCourt to read in some unspecified remedy in <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_77\">Section\n10</a> or substitute for penal consequences specified in\n<a href=\"/doc/790314/\" id=\"a_78\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/539839/\" id=\"a_79\">25</a> a different sequel, be it absorption\nof contract labour in the establishment of principal\nemployer or a lesser or a harsher punishment. Such an\ninterpretation of the provisions of the statute will be far\nbeyond the principle of ironing out the creases and the\nscope of interpretative legislation and as such, clearly\nimpermissible. We have already held above, on\nconsideration of various aspects, that it is difficult to\naccept that Parliament intended absorption of contract\nlabour on issue of abolition notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_80\">Section\n10(1)</a> of the CLRA Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">125.The upshot of the above discussion is outlined thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">  (1)(a) Before 28­1­1986, the determination of the\nquestion whether the Central Government or the State\nGovernment is the appropriate Government in relation\nto an establishment, will depend, in view of the\ndefinition of the expression “appropriate Government”\nas stood in the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_81\">CLRA Act</a>, on the answer to a further\nquestion, is the industry under consideration carried\non by or under the authority of the Central\nGovernment or does it pertain to any specified\ncontrolled industry, or the establishment of any\nrailway, cantonment board, major port, mine or oilfield\nor the establishment of banking or insurance\ncompany?

But it is the\n           contractor as employer, who chooses whether the\n           worker is to be assigned/allotted to the principal\n           employer or used otherwise. In short, worker being the\n           employee of the contractor, the ultimate supervision\n           and control lies with the contractor as he decides\n           where the employee will work and how long he will\n           work and subject to what conditions. Only when the\n           contractor assigns/sends the worker to work under the\n           principal employer, the worker works under the\n           supervision and control of the principal employer but\n           that is secondary control. The primary control is with\n           the contractor.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">38.

The Tribunal in its award dated 16 th September, 2009 has\n\nrecorded a finding of fact based on oral and documentary\n\nevidence placed by the respective parties on record in reference to\n\nthe fact whether the contract was sham and bogus which was a\n\nprimary cause of adjudication and it was observed that the\n\ncontractors employed the contract labour on their own and they\n\nwere the appointing authority.

Other\n\nwitnesses also in cross­examination have supported that half of\n\nthe PF amount of the workers were deposited by their respective\n\ncontractors.   Exh. W/39 to W/54 submitted by the contract\n\nlabours are the photocopies of the identity cards, pay slips, PF\n\nslips etc. These pay slips and identity cards do not show that all\n\n3079 workers were working after the notification dated 17 th\n\nMarch, 1993 without break because number of these documents\n\nare of prior to the notification. It further observed that all the\n\nagreements between the management and the contractors are\n\nentered into prior to the notification dated 17th March, 1993\n\nprohibiting employment of contract labour and only extended\n\nthereafter from time to time. It goes to show that there was no\n\nfresh contract thereafter ever entered between the parties.

It was further observed that the contractors had full control\n\nover the skilled and professional work and the SAIL had right to\n\nreject the limestone, if it was not within the specified approved\n\ngrade as per terms and conditions of the agreement and after\n\nextensive appreciation of the oral/documentary evidence on\n\nrecord, CGIT recorded a finding of fact holding that the contract\n\nwas not sham and bogus at least up to the date of issuance of the\n\nprohibition notification dated 17th March, 1993. Although in\n\nparagraph 85 of the award the Tribunal has recorded a finding\n\nthat after the issuance of prohibition notification dated 17 th\n\nMarch, 1993 by operation of law, it became sham and bogus but\n\nin our considered view, such a finding recorded in para 85 of the\n\nAward dated 16th September, 2009 is not sustainable in law for\n\nthe simple reason that mere issuance of the prohibition\n\nnotification   under     <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_100\">CLRA     Act</a>    will   not   make     the\n\ncontract/agreement to be void ab initio or bad in law and if the\n\nemployees are allowed to continue in terms of the earlier\n\nagreement after the prohibition notification under <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_101\">CLRA Act</a> has\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                                 36</span>\n\fcome into force, it may be illegal and continuance of service in\n\nthe absence of any contract which stands extinguished by virtue\n\nof prohibition notification has to face the penal consequences as\n\nembedded under the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_102\">CLRA Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">42.

To say so, every establishment\n\nis under obligation to implement the mandate of law but that\n\ncould not be a determining factor/denominator to test the\n\ncontract agreement entered between the parties in arriving to a\n\nconclusion that such an agreement is sham, nominal or\n\ncamouflage as held by the High Court in its impugned judgment.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">43.
