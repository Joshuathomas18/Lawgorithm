The question that arises for consideration in the batch of\n\nappeals by special leave is as to whether (1) the High Court was\n\njustified   in   invoking   amended   provision   which   has   been\n\nintroduced by Arbitration and Conciliation(Amendment Act),\n\n2015 with effect from 23rd October, 2015(hereinafter being\n\nreferred to as “Amendment Act, 2015”); (2) whether the\n\narbitration agreement stands discharged on acceptance of the\n\namount and signing no claim/discharge certificate and (3)\n\nwhether it was permissible for the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n11(6)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996(prior to the\n\nAmendment Act, 2015) to appoint third party or an independent\n\nArbitrator when the parties have mutually agreed for the\n\nprocedure vis­à­vis the authority to appoint the designated\n\narbitrator.      The High Court has passed separate orders in\n\nexercise of its powers under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 in\n\nappointing an independent arbitrator without adhering to the\n\nmutually agreed procedure under the agreement executed\n\nbetween the parties. Since the batch of appeals involve common\n\nquestions of law and facts with the consent of parties, are\n\ndisposed off by the present judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                   3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\f3.   The facts have been noticed from civil appeal arising out of\n\nSLP(Civil) no. 2166 of 2018.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.   The work for construction of office accommodation for\n\nofficer and rest house was allotted to the respondent contractor,\n\nat Dungarpur in the State of Rajasthan on 21st December, 2011.\n\nAs alleged, the extension was granted by the appellants to\n\ncomplete the work by 31st March, 2013. The measurement was\n\naccepted by the respondent under protest and when appellants\n\nofficials failed to clear 7th final bill until the respondent put a line\n\nover “under protest” and signed no claim certificate.        The total\n\nvalue of the work executed was of Rs. 58.60 lakhs against which\n\nRs. 55.54 lakhs was paid and escalation cost was not added with\n\ninterest @ 18% over delay payment. Demand notice was sent to\n\nthe appellants to appoint an arbitrator invoking Clause 64(3) of\n\nthe GCC to resolve the disputes/differences on 23 rd December,\n\n2013.   When the appellants failed to appoint the arbitrator in\n\nterms of Clause 64(3), application came to be filed under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n\n11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 before the Chief Justice/his Designate for\n\nappointment of an independent arbitrator who after hearing the\n\nparties under the impugned judgment allowed the application of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                       4</span>\n\fthe respondent and appointed a retired judge of the High Court\n\nas an independent arbitrator to arbitrate the proceedings.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">5.   In the instant batch of appeals, one fact is common that the\n\norders were placed for various nature of construction works for\n\nits execution and the agreement executed between the parties\n\nincludes a separate chapter for settlement of disputes leaving any\n\ndispute or difference between the parties to be resolved through\n\nthe process of arbitration by appointing an arbitrator invoking\n\nclause 64(3) of the contract. As per terms of the agreement, date\n\nof completion of the project was delayed as alleged due to breach\n\nof obligations by the appellants and the scheduled date of\n\ncompletion had to be extended.    Meanwhile, due to rise in the\n\nprices of raw material, the project was impossible to be completed\n\nby the respondent contractors and hence correspondence was\n\nmade to either pay the escalated price or in the absence, the\n\nrespondents would not be in a position to conclude the contract.\n\nIt was alleged that the appellants accepted the terms and\n\nconditions for escalated prices and asked the respondents to\n\ncomplete the work and handover the project.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                 5</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\f6.   But when the respondents raised the final bills in the pre­\n\ndetermined format (which also included the no dues certificate)\n\non the newly agreed prices, dispute has arisen in context of\n\npayment of escalated prices or withholding of security deposits,\n\ntaking note of the existence of arbitration clause in the agreement\n\nthe respondents sent a notice to appoint an arbitrator as per\n\nclause 64(3) of GCC to resolve the dispute of payment of\n\noutstanding dues which was declined by the appellants by\n\nsending the reply that “No Due Certificate” was signed and that\n\nentails no dispute to be sent to arbitration. Since the appellants\n\nfailed to appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the arbitration\n\nclause in the agreement, each of the respondent filed application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act before the High Court for\n\nappointment of an independent arbitrator and the primary\n\nobjection of the appellants before the High Court was that on\n\nfurnishing the no claim certificate by the contractor, no dispute\n\nsubsists which is to be sent to the arbitrator and further the\n\nclaims which has been submitted were beyond time as prescribed\n\nin the agreement and thus falls under the ‘excepted matter’ in the\n\nagreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                  6</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\f7.

The High Court further observed that the amended\n\nprovisions of Act, 2015 shall apply to the pending proceedings\n\nand mere furnishing of no claim certificate would not take away\n\nthe right of the parties and it is open for adjudication before the\n\narbitrator and appointed a retired Judge of the High Court as an\n\nindependent sole arbitrator under the impugned judgment in\n\nexercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996.\n\nIndisputedly, the request for the dispute to be referred to\n\narbitration in the instant batch of appeals was received by the\n\nappellants much before the Amendment Act, 2015 came into\n\nforce (i.e. 23rd October, 2015).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">8.

The facts which manifest from the batch of appeals are that\n\nthe respondents are the registered contractors with the railway\n\nestablishment and undertaking work contracts (construction) of\n\nvarious kinds. They raised a demand for escalation cost and the\n\ninterest accrued thereon because the date of the completion of\n\nthe project was delayed as alleged due to breach of obligations by\n\nthe appellants and the scheduled date of completion had to be\n\nextended.   In the interregnum period, there was a rise in the\n\nprices of the raw material and the project became impossible to\n\nbe completed by the respondent contractors. Hence, a request\n\nwas made to the appellants to either pay the enhanced escalation\n\nprice otherwise the respondent contractors would not be in a\n\nposition to conclude the contract and on the acceptance for\n\npayment of the escalation costs, respondent contractor completed\n\nthe work and delivered the project and raised final bills in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                15</span>\n\fprescribed pre­determined format (which also included no dues\n\ncertificate).   Since the dispute has arisen in the context of the\n\npayment of the escalated cost, as demanded by respondent\n\ncontractors, and their being a clause of arbitration in the\n\nagreement, each of the respondent contractors sent a notice for\n\narbitration invoking clause 64(3) of GCC, which in majority of the\n\ncases declined by the appellants stating that no dues certificate\n\nhas been furnished and that entailed no subsisting dispute and\n\nthat was the reason due to which each of the respondent\n\ncontractor      had   approached    the   High    Court    by      filing   an\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996.

As per <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 26</a> of the Act, the\n        provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015 shall apply in\n        relation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after\n        the date of commencement of the Amendment Act,\n        2015(w.e.f. 23.10.2015).       In the present case,\n        arbitration proceedings commenced way back in 2013,\n        much prior to coming into force of the amended Act\n        and, therefore, provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_39\">Amended Act</a> cannot\n        be invoked.”</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">26.   We are also of the view that the Amendment Act, 2015\n\nwhich came into force, i.e. on 23 rd October, 2015, shall not apply\n\nto the arbitral proceedings which has commenced in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act, 1996 before\n\nthe coming into force of Amendment Act, 2015, unless the parties\n\notherwise agree.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">27.

Whether the application\n\nwas pending for appointment of an arbitrator or in the case of\n\nrejection because of no claim as in the instant case for\n\nappointment of an arbitrator including change/substitution of\n\narbitrator, would not be of any legal effect for invoking the\n\nprovisions of Amendment Act, 2015, in terms of Section 21 of the\n\nprincipal   Act,   1996.       In    our   considered   view,   the\n\napplications/requests   made    by   the   respondent   contractors\n\ndeserves to be examined in accordance with the principal Act,\n\n1996 without taking resort to the Amendment Act, 2015 which\n\ncame into force from 23rd October, 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">28.   The thrust of the learned counsel for the appellants that\n\nsubmission of a no claim certificate furnished by each of the\n\nrespondent/contractor takes away the right for settlement of\n\ndispute/difference arising in terms of the agreement to be\n\nexamined by the arbitrator invoking Clause 64(3) of the\n\nconditions of the contract.

The aforesaid cases fall under two categories, the one\n\ncategory where the Court after considering the facts found that\n\nthere was full and final settlement resulting in accord and\n\nsatisfaction and there was no substance in the allegations of\n\ncoercion/undue influence. In the second category of cases, the\n\nCourt found some substance in the contention of the claimants\n\nthat “no­dues/no claims certificate or discharge vouchers” were\n\ninsisted and taken (either on a printed format or otherwise) as a\n\ncondition precedent for release of the admitted dues and\n\nconsequently this Court held that the disputes are arbitrable. It\n\ntook note of the principles earlier examined and summarised in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_40\">National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Boghara Polyfab\n\nPrivate Limited</a> case (supra) as under: ­\n\n\n         “44. None of the three cases relied on by the appellant\n         lay down a proposition that mere execution of a full\n         and final settlement receipt or a discharge voucher is a\n         bar to arbitration, even when the validity thereof is\n         challenged by the claimant on the ground of fraud,\n         coercion or undue influence. Nor do they lay down a\n         proposition that even if the discharge of contract is not\n         genuine or legal, the claims cannot be referred to\n         arbitration. In all the three cases, the Court examined\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                                     28</span>\n\f         the facts and satisfied itself that there was accord and\n         satisfaction or complete discharge of the contract and\n         that there was no evidence to support the allegation of\n         coercion/undue influence.”</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">31.   Further, taking note of the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice/\n\nhis Designate in the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 11(6)</a> of Act 1996,\n\nthis Court culled out the legal proposition in paragraph 51 as\n\nfollows:­\n\n         “51. The Chief Justice/his designate exercising\n         jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 11</a> of the Act will consider\n         whether there was really accord and satisfaction or\n         discharge of contract by performance. If the answer is\n         in the affirmative, he will refuse to refer the dispute to\n         arbitration. On the other hand, if the Chief Justice/his\n         designate comes to the conclusion that the full and\n         final settlement receipt or discharge voucher was the\n         result of any fraud/coercion/undue influence, he will\n         have to hold that there was no discharge of the\n         contract and consequently, refer the dispute to\n         arbitration. Alternatively, where the Chief Justice/his\n         designate is satisfied prima facie that the discharge\n         voucher was not issued voluntarily and the claimant\n         was under some compulsion or coercion, and that the\n         matter deserved detailed consideration, he may instead\n         of deciding the issue himself, refer the matter to the\n         Arbitral Tribunal with a specific direction that the said\n         question should be decided in the first instance.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_43\">32.   It further laid down the illustrations as to when claims are\n\narbitrable and when they are not.

Some illustrations (not exhaustive) as to when\n        claims are arbitrable and when they are not, when\n        discharge of contract by accord and satisfaction are\n        disputed, to round up the discussion on this subject\n        are:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        (i) A claim is referred to a conciliation or a pre­litigation\n        Lok Adalat. The parties negotiate and arrive at a\n        settlement. The terms of settlement are drawn up and\n        signed by both the parties and attested by the\n        conciliator or the members of the Lok Adalat. After\n        settlement by way of accord and satisfaction, there can\n        be no reference to arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        (ii) A claimant makes several claims. The admitted or\n        undisputed claims are paid. Thereafter negotiations are\n        held for settlement of the disputed claims resulting in\n        an agreement in writing settling all the pending claims\n        and disputes. On such settlement, the amount agreed\n        is paid and the contractor also issues a discharge\n        voucher/no­claim certificate/full and final receipt.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">        After the contract is discharged by such accord and\n        satisfaction, neither the contract nor any dispute\n        survives for consideration. There cannot be any\n        reference of any dispute to arbitration thereafter.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">        (iii) A contractor executes the work and claims payment\n        of say rupees ten lakhs as due in terms of the contract.\n        The employer admits the claim only for rupees six\n        lakhs and informs the contractor either in writing or\n        orally that unless the contractor gives a discharge\n        voucher in the prescribed format acknowledging\n        receipt of rupees six lakhs in full and final satisfaction\n        of the contract, payment of the admitted amount will\n        not be released. The contractor who is hard­pressed for\n        funds and keen to get the admitted amount released,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                        30</span>\n\f        signs on the dotted line either in a printed form or\n        otherwise, stating that the amount is received in full\n        and final settlement. In such a case, the discharge is\n        under economic duress on account of coercion\n        employed by the employer. Obviously, the discharge\n        voucher cannot be considered to be voluntary or as\n        having resulted in discharge of the contract by accord\n        and satisfaction. It will not be a bar to arbitration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">        (iv) An insured makes a claim for loss suffered. The\n        claim is neither admitted nor rejected. But the insured\n        is informed during discussions that unless the\n        claimant gives a full and final voucher for a specified\n        amount (far lesser than the amount claimed by the\n        insured), the entire claim will be rejected. Being in\n        financial difficulties, the claimant agrees to the\n        demand and issues an undated discharge voucher in\n        full and final settlement. Only a few days thereafter,\n        the admitted amount mentioned in the voucher is paid.\n        The accord and satisfaction in such a case is not\n        voluntary but under duress, compulsion and coercion.\n        The coercion is subtle, but very much real. The\n        “accord” is not by free consent. The arbitration\n        agreement can thus be invoked to refer the disputes to\n        arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">        (v) A claimant makes a claim for a huge sum, by way of\n        damages. The respondent disputes the claim. The\n        claimant who is keen to have a settlement and avoid\n        litigation, voluntarily reduces the claim and requests\n        for settlement. The respondent agrees and settles the\n        claim and obtains a full and final discharge voucher.\n        Here even if the claimant might have agreed for\n        settlement due to financial compulsions and\n        commercial pressure or economic duress, the decision\n        was his free choice. There was no threat, coercion or\n        compulsion by the respondent. Therefore, the accord\n        and satisfaction is binding and valid and there cannot\n        be any subsequent claim or reference to arbitration.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">33.

The\n       conditions of clauses 63 and 64 of the General Conditions of\n       Contract are almost analogous to the one we have in our\n       hand. In that case also relying on clause 64 of the contract a\n       three-Judge Bench presided over by the Chief Justice of\n       India observed as follows: (SCC p. 505, para 4)\n\n                   “4.

Patel\n\nEngineering Company Limited</a>(supra) as follows:­\n\n       “5. It is pointed out that there are three clauses in\n       sub­section (6) of Section 11. Clause (c) relates to\n       failure to perform function entrusted to a person\n       including an institution and also failure to act under\n       the procedure agreed upon by the parties. In other\n       words, clause (a) refers to parties to the agreement.\n       Clause (c) relates to a person who may not be party to\n       the agreement but has given consent to the agreement.\n       It is also pointed out that there is a statutory mandate\n       to take necessary measures, unless the agreement on\n       the appointment procedure provided other means for\n       securing the appointment. It is, therefore, submitted\n       that before the alternative is resorted to, agreed\n       procedure has to be exhausted. The agreement has to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                                        43</span>\n\f        be given effect and the contract has to be adhered to as\n        closely as possible. Corrective measures have to be\n        taken first and the Court is the last resort.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">        6. It is also pointed out that while appointing an\n        arbitrator in terms of sub­section (8) of Section 11, the\n        Court has to give due regard to any qualification\n        required for the arbitrator by the agreement of the\n        parties and other considerations as are likely to secure\n        the appointment of an independent and impartial\n        arbitrator. It is pointed out that both these conditions\n        are cumulative in nature. Therefore, the Court should\n        not directly make an appointment. It has to ensure\n        first that the provided remedy is exhausted and the\n        Court may ask to do what has not been done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"276364\" id=\"span_69\">12. A bare reading of the scheme of Section 11 shows\n        that the emphasis is on the terms of the agreement\n        being adhered to and/or given effect as closely as\n        possible. In other words, the Court may ask to do what\n        has not been done. The Court must first ensure that\n        the remedies provided for are exhausted. It is true as\n        contended by Mr. Desai, that it is not mandatory for\n        the Chief Justice or any person or institution\n        designated by him to appoint the named arbitrator or\n        arbitrators. But at the same time, due regard has to be\n        given to the qualifications required by the agreement\n        and other considerations.”\n\n\nand   further,   in   <a href=\"/doc/276364/\" id=\"a_58\">Union      of   India     Vs.

The question that arises for consideration in this\n        appeal by special leave is whether the appointment of a\n        retired Judge of the High Court as sole arbitrator\n        should be set aside and an Arbitral Tribunal should\n        again be constituted in the manner provided in terms\n        of Clause 64.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1790150\" id=\"span_70\">12.

This Court held that the\n        appointment of arbitrator(s) named in the arbitration\n        agreement is not mandatory or a must, but the\n        emphasis should be on the terms of the arbitration\n        agreement being adhered to and/or given effect, as\n        closely as possible.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">        14. It   was    further  held     in Northern Railway\n        case [(2008) 10 SCC 240] that the Chief Justice or his\n        designate should first ensure that the remedies\n        provided under the arbitration agreement are\n        exhausted, but at the same time also ensure that the\n        twin requirements of sub­section (8) of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 11</a> of\n        the Act are kept in view. This would mean that\n        invariably the court should first appoint the arbitrators\n        in the manner provided for in the arbitration\n        agreement. But where the independence and\n        impartiality of the arbitrator(s) appointed/nominated\n        in terms of the arbitration agreement is in doubt, or\n        where the Arbitral Tribunal appointed in the manner\n        provided in the arbitration agreement has not\n        functioned and it becomes necessary to make fresh\n        appointment, the Chief Justice or his designate is not\n        powerless     to    make      appropriate     alternative\n        arrangements to give effect to the provision for\n        arbitration.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">41.
