RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\tThis appeal arises out of  an order passed by a learned Judge, allowing\na writ petition filed by the workers Union directing the Government to make a\nreference of an Industrial Dispute raised by them for an adjudication by the\nCentral Industrial Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">\t2. We have heard Mr. G. Masilamani, learned Senior Counsel appearing\nfor the Appellant and M/s. D. Geetha, learned counsel appearing for the first\nRespondent, Mr. K.K.Senthilvelan, learned Assistant Solicitor General ? I,\nappearing for the respondents 2 and 3 and Mr. Anbusaravanan, learned counsel\nappearing for the fourth respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\t3. The first respondent is a Trade Union registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1980557/\" id=\"a_1\">Trade\nUnions Act, 1953</a>. It is affiliated with the General Workers Union (CITU). The\nfirst Respondent Union raised an Industrial Dispute on behalf of about 29\nworkers, employed as Contract Workers through the fourth respondent herein,\nin the Tuticorin branch of the Appellant herein, seeking regularization of\nthe services of the Contract Workers. The Assistant Commissioner of Labour\n(Central) initiated Conciliation Proceedings, bu the same ended in failure.\nTherefore, he submitted a Failure Report on 26.09.2007 to the Government of\nIndia. By a letter dated 4.12.2007, the Government of India refused to refer\nthe dispute for adjudication, on the ground that the matter can be taken up\nwith the Contract Labour Advisory Board by the first Respondent Union under\n<a href=\"/doc/1442514/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 10(2)</a> of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\t4. Challenging the order of the Government dated 4.12.2007 refusing to\nrefer the dispute for adjudication, the first respondent Union filed a writ\npetition in W.P.No.6928 of 2008. An objection was raised by the Appellant\nherein that the first Respondent Union was not a registered body and that\ntherefore, the writ petition was not maintainable. In view of the said\nobjection, the first Respondent Union took steps to get it registered and\nwithdrew the writ petition with liberty. After registration of the Union, the\nfirst respondent filed a writ petition in W.P.(MD)No.6676 of 2009,\nchallenging the order of rejection dated 4.12.2007 and also seeking a\nconsequential direction to refer the dispute for adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">\t5. By a final order dated 16.03.2012, K.Chandru, J allowed the writ\npetition, on the short ground that <a href=\"/doc/1442514/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 10(2)</a> of Contract Labour\n(Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 was not a bar for raising an Industrial\nDispute. The learned Judge accordingly directed the Government to consider\nthe case of the petitioner Union afresh, in accordance with law. Aggrieved by\nthe said order of the learned Judge, the Management is on appeal before us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t6. Mr. G. Masilamani, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\nappellant, assailed the order of the learned Judge on the following grounds:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(i)  That when there was no relationship of Employer and Employee between the\nappellant and those 29 workmen, there was no possibility for making a\nreference ;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(ii) That the order of the appropriate Government refusing to make a\nreference was only an administrative order and not a Judicial or Quasi-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">Judicial order and hence, the scope of Judicial Review of such order is\nextremely circumscribed;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">(iii) That the Union was actually blowing hot and cold, by going before the\nAdvisory Board under the Contract Labour Act and also raising an Industrial\nDispute as against the Contractor for the termination of the employees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\t7. We have carefully considered the above submissions. The first ground\nof attack to the order of the learned Judge is that when there was no\nrelationship of Employer and Employee between the appellant and the workers\nwhose cause was sought to be espoused by the first respondent Union, there is\nno dispute much less Industrial Dispute warranting any adjudication. This is\nwhy, according to the learned Senior Counsel, the Government refused to make\na reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">\t8. But, we do not agree with the learned Senior Counsel for the\nappellant. The question as to whether a relationship of Employer and Employee\nexists between the two, is actually a question of fact. It is not open to the\nappropriate Government to adjudicate upon it, even before making a reference.\nIt  could be seen from the representation made by the first respondent Union\nto the Assistant Commissioner of Labour (Central), that they specifically\npleaded that the appellant was the principal employer and various persons\nacted as immediate employers in the past. Though the Contractors, who acted\nas immediate employers, get changing, the workforce namely these 29 workers\nremained the same. This was the specific case of the first respondent Union.\nTherefore, the first respondent contended that the contracts were noting but\nsmokescreen created by the appellant Management to create an illusion as\nthough those 29 workers were Contract Labourers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\t9. When the specific case of the Trade Union was that the Contract\nLabour System was sham and nominal and that the appellant Management was\nobliged to absorb those persons into their regular Pay Rolls, it cannot be\ncontended that the existence of the relationship could be decided even\nwithout making reference. Hence, the first contention of the appellant that\nthere was no relationship of Employer and Employee has to be rejected. Once\nthere is specific pleading that the contract system was used to camouflage\nrelationship, the question of existence of the relationship becomes a\nquestion of fact, which can be adjudicated only upon taking evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">\t10. The second ground of attack tot he order of the learned Judge is\nthat the decision of the appropriate Government not to refer the dispute for\nadjudication is an administrative order and that therefore, it does not\nwarrant a close scrutiny.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">\t11. It is true that the order making a reference or refusing to make a\nreference is an administrative order. It is for the very same reason that the\nappropriate Government cannot come to any conclusion about the entitlement of\nthe workers to any relief or not. All that the appropriate Government is\nobliged to do in cases of this nature is only to see whether there was an\nIndustrial Dispute in existence or not. But what the appellant wants the\nGovernment to see is as to whether the workmen in this case can seek reliefs\nthat they sought or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\t12. In Shaw Wallace &amp; Company Limited ..Vs.. State of Tamil Nadu [\n(1987) 1 L.L.J. 177], a Division Bench of this Court elicited the principles\non the basis of which the appropriate Government should take a decision.\nParagraph 32 of the said decision reads as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">32. On a final analysis, the following principles emerge :-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(1) The Government would normally refer the dispute for \t\nadjudication;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(2) The Government may refuse to make reference, if -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t(a) the claim is very state;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t(b) the claim is opposed to the provisions of the Act;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t(c) the claim is inconsistent with any agreement between \t    the\nparties;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t(d) the claim is patently frivolous;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t(e) the impact of the claim on the general relations \t   \t\nbetween the employer and the employees in the region \t       is likely to be\nadverse;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t(f) the person concerned is not a workman as defined by \t    the\nAct;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(3) The Government should not act on irrelevant and extraneous\nconsiderations;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(4) The Government should act honestly and bona fide;\n(5) The Government should not embark on adjudication of the dispute; and\n(6) The Government should not refuse reference on the ground that domestic\nenquiry was fairly and properly held and punishment awarded was appropriate.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\t13. In paragraph 34 of the very same decision, the Division Bench\npointed out that the question whether a person is a workman as defined by the\nAct or not, has to be decided only on the basis of the nature of the duties\nattached to his office or the powers vested in him and that this question\ncannot be decided by the Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">\t14. Therefore this Court has to test as to whether an order of the\nappropriate Government making or refusing to make a reference, is valid or\nnot, on the basis of the principles set out in the case of Shaw Wallace\nCompany.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t15. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"785543\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1789069\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/1789069/\" id=\"a_4\">Secretary, Indian Tea Association v. Ajit Kumar Barat</a> [(2000) 3\nSupreme Court Cases 93], the Court referred to an earlier decision in <a href=\"/doc/785543/\" id=\"a_5\">Prem\nKakar v. State of Haryana</a> [(1976) 3 SCC 433], wherein it was held that the\norder of the Government under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 10(1)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/347928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 12(5)</a> of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, passed after subjective satisfaction, is an\nadministrative order and not a judicial or a Quasi-judicial one. Therefore,\nthe Court pointed out that once the Government had passed a reasoned order\nafter subjective satisfaction, the Court cannot sit on appeal over the same.\nEventually, the law on the point was summarized in para 7 of decision\nreported in Indian Tea Association as follows:-</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;7. The law on the point may briefly be summarized as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">1. The appropriate Government would not be justified in making a reference\nunder <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 10</a> of the Act without satisfying itself on the facts and\ncircumstances brought to its notice that an industrial dispute exists or\napprehended and if such a reference is made it is desirable wherever\npossible, for the government to indicate the nature of dispute in the order\nof reference;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">2. The order of the appropriate Government making a reference under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n10</a> of the Act is an administrative order and not a judicial or quasi-judicial\none and court, therefore, cannot canvass the order of the reference closely\nto see if there was any material before the Government to support its\nconclusion, as if it was a judicial or quasi judicial order;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">3. An order made by the appropriate government under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 10</a> of the Act\nbeing an administrative order no lis is involved, as such an order is made on\nthe subjective satisfaction of the Government;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">4. If it appears from the reasons given that the appropriate govern-ment took\ninto account any consideration irrelevant or foreign material, the court may\nin a given case consider the case for a writ of mandamus and;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">5, It would, however, be open to a party to show that what was referred by\nthe Government was not an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Act&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">\t16. But the aforesaid decision, may not be of any assistance to the\nappellant, for the simple reason that the order of refusal dated 4.12.2007\npassed by the Government of India was not on the basis that there was no\nrelationship of Employer and Employee. The order dated 4.12.2007 reads as\nfollows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\t&quot;I am directed to refer to the Failure of Conciliation Report\nNo.M.8/75/2007-A/M dated 26/09/2007 from the ALC(MADURAI) received in this\nMinistry on 15/10/2007 on the above mentioned subject and to say that, prima\nfacie, this Ministry does not consider this dispute fit for adjudication for\nthe following reasons:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">\t&quot;Since the matter relates to abolition as well as absorption of\ncontract labour, the Union can take up the matter with the Contract Labour\nAdvisory Board under <a href=\"/doc/1442514/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 10(2)</a> of the Contract Labour (Regulation &amp;\nAbolition) Act, 1970&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">\t17. Moreover, the test for determining whether the reference of a\ndispute is valid or not, are slightly different from the test for determining\nwhether a refusal to refer is bad or not. The refusal to refer, strickes at\nthe very root of the entitlement of both parties to have a dispute finally\nadjudicated by a competent forum. But, an order of reference merely ignites a\nprocess of adjudication without causing any harm or prejudice to any one of\nthe parties. Therefore, it is neither good to confer a power upon the\nGovernment to pre-adjudicate the matter nor to shrink the power of Judicial\nReview on the ground that the decision of the Government is only\nadministrative in nature and it cannot be interfered with. Hence, the second\ncontention of the appellant is also rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">\t18. The third ground of attack to the order of the learned Judge\nrevolves around the petition submitted by the first respondent Union to the\nContract Labour Advisory Board and an Industrial Dispute already raised\nagainst the Contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">\t19. It appears that the first respondent Union made a representation\ndated 18.07.2005 to the Government of India, requesting the Government to\nprohibit the employment of Contract Labour under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 10(1)</a> of the\nContract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act 1970. The Government of India\nforwarded the said representation to the Regional Labour Commissioner\n(Central) on 04.01.2006, calling upon him to verify the claim of the Union\nand to furnish a personal report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\t20. There was also a settlement reached between the 4th Respondent\nherein and some of the Contract Workmen under <a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 18(1)</a> of the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947. In addition, there were also settlements under <a href=\"/doc/476610/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n12(3)</a> of the Act. Similarly, an Industrial Dispute had been raised under\n<a href=\"/doc/1377486/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 2A</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in I.D.No.6 of 2009 before\nthe Central Government Industrial Tribunal, about the validity of the\ntermination of the services of some employees who were appointed as Contract\nLabours. The Central Government Industrial Tribunal passed an Award in the\nsaid dispute on 18.07.2011 holding that the appellant Corporation was not\nanswerable to the claim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">\t21. Therefore, on the basis of the (1) representation made under the\n<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_16\">Contract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act</a> 1970, (2) the Settlements\nreached under <a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 18(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1724112/\" id=\"a_18\">12(3)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947\nwith the Contractors and (3) the Award passed by the Central Government\nIndustrial Tribunal in I.D.No.6 of 2009, it is contended by Mr. G.\nMasilamani, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that there is no\nquestion of referring the present dispute for adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">\t22. However, as rightly pointed out by M/s. D. Geetha, learned counsel\nappearing for the first respondent Union, we are not concerned here with the\nvalidity of the claim of the first Respondent Union. We are only concerned\nwith the entitlement of the first Respondent Union to have the dispute\nreferred for adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\t23. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_19\">Steel Authority of India v.  National Union Waterfront Workers</a>\n[(2001) 7 Supreme Court Cases 1], the Supreme Court explained the concept of\nthe term &quot;Contract Labour&quot;. It was held in paragraph 71 of the said report\nthat a workman may be hired in an establishment by the principal employer or\nby his agent with or without the knowledge of the principal employer. He may\nalso be hired in connection with the work of an establishment by the\nprincipal employer through a contractor or by a contractor with or without\nthe knowledge of the principal employer. Where a workman is hired in or in\nconnection with the work of an establishment by the principal employer\nthrough a contractor, he merely acts as an &quot;agent&quot; so that there will be\n&quot;master-and-servant&quot; relationship between the principal employer and the\nworkman.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\t24. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1071315\" id=\"span_4\">In para 97 of the decision in Steel Authority of India, the Supreme\nCourt referred to the earlier decision in <a href=\"/doc/1071315/\" id=\"a_20\">R.K.Panda v. Steel Authority of\nIndia</a>, in which the Supreme Court found that the same workers were engaged by\nchanging contractors. Therefore, the Court held that the question whether the\ncontract labours had become the workers of the principal employer in a course\nof time or not had to be established on the basis of the requisite material\nbefore the Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal. In para 102 of the same\ndecision, the Supreme Court held that if the so-called contract is a sham and\ncamouflage to hide the reality, <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 10</a> would not apply and the workmen\ncan raise an industrial dispute for the very same relief with which they have\nnow come in this Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_5\">The Bench referred to the decision in <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_22\">Air India</a> case\n[(1997) 9 SCC 377], which modified the decision in Gujaraj Electricity Board\ncase [(1995) 5 SCC 27] and came to the conclusion that the Labour Court or\nIndustrial adjudicator would have jurisdiction to entertain the said dispute.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\t25. In paragraph 125 of the report, the Supreme Court actually\nsummarized the position that evolved out of the discussions. In sub para (3)\nof para 125, the Supreme Court indicated that <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 10</a> of the Contract\nLabour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act does not provide for automatic\nabsorption. In sub para (5), the Supreme Court held that the Industrial\nadjudicator will have to consider whether the contractor has been interposed\nto produce any given result or as a mere ruse/camouflage to evade compliance\nwith various beneficial legislations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\t26. In the light of the law so well laid down by the Supreme Court in\nSteel Authority of India Limited, we do not think that the representation\nmade under the Contract Labour Act or the settlements reached with the\ncontractors would destroy a statutory remedy available to the workmen at\nleast to have their dispute heard and adjudicated by a competent forum.\nTherefore, the third ground of attack to the decision of the learned Judge\nalso deserves to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"117279545\" id=\"span_6\">27. Relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/117279545/\" id=\"a_24\">Rashtriya\nChemicals v. General Employees&#x27; Association</a> [(2007) 5 Supreme Court Cases\n273], it is contended by Mr. G. Masilamani, learned Senior Counsel for the\nappellant that a Court cannot straightaway direct the Government to refer the\ndispute for adjudication. But we do not know why <a href=\"/doc/117279545/\" id=\"a_25\">the said decision</a> is sought\nto be relied upon. In the case on hand, the learned Judge merely set aside\nthe order of refusal of the Government to refer the dispute with the\nIndustrial Tribunal and remitted the matter back for effective consideration.\nIn the operative portion of the order, the learned Judge merely directed the\nGovernment to consider the case afresh and take a decision within 8 weeks.\nTherefore, there is no cause for any complaint that the learned Judge\noverstepped the jurisdiction conferred upon him.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">\t28. In fine, we do not find any justification to interfere with the\norder of the learned Judge. Hence, the writ appeal is dismissed. The\nappropriate Government, who is the second Respondent herein, is directed to\nconsider the representation of the first Respondent Union and take a decision\nand communicate the same to both parties within a period of 8 weeks from the\ndate of receipt of copy of this order.
