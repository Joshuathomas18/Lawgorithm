Appellants are sixteen in number. They claim that they are\n\nthe owners of property bearing Nos.1-4-887/1 and 1-4-887/2,\n\nadmeasuring 1996 square yards situated in Bakaram village of\n\nHyderabad (for brevity hereinafter referred to as &#x27;subject property&#x27;).\n\nA    Development    Agreement-cum-General               Power        of       Attorney\n\n(DAGPA) on the above property was drawn on 23.10.1999 in favour\n\nof second respondent containing signatures of 12 appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">                                                                 PNR, &amp; Dr.GRR,J\n                                                     CMA Nos.1264 of 2012 &amp; 42 of 2013\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 4                             &amp; CRP No.2835 of 2016</span>\n\n\n\n\nThereafter, second respondent in his individual capacity and also\n\nas GPA holder of appellants entered into separate development\n\nagreement on the very same property on 05.02.2007 with first\n\nrespondent.   The said development agreement vests right in the\n\ndeveloper-first respondent to an extent of 60% of the property\n\ndeveloped in accordance there with and on remaining extent on\n\nsecond respondent.      It appears that some differences arose\n\nbetween respondent Nos.1 and 2 leading to second respondent\n\ncancelling the development agreement vide cancellation deed dated\n\n29.01.2007.   According to appellants, having come to know that\n\nsecond respondent entered into development agreement with first\n\nrespondent    on   05.02.2007   and   on   29.10.2007      the         second\n\nrespondent cancelled the said agreement, they have cancelled the\n\nDevelopment Agreement cum General Power of Attorney dated\n\n23.10.1999 vide document dated 30.10.2007.        This time all the\n\nappellants have signed the document. On the same day, they have\n\nentered into fresh Development Agreement cum General Power of\n\nAttorney with M/s.Kura Homes Pvt.

Alleging that the terms of Development Agreement are\n\nviolated, causing loss to him, the first respondent invoked Clause 9\n\nof the Development Agreement dated 05.02.2007, which envisages\n\nresort to Arbitration to resolve inter se disputes. Hon&#x27;ble Justice\n\nV.Neeladri Rao (Retd.,) was appointed as sole arbitrator.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">6.    Before the Arbitrator, the first respondent sought for\n\ndeclaration of execution of the cancellation deed dated 29.6.2007\n\nas illegal, null and void and to set aside the same; to direct the\n\nrespondents to handover the subject property or in the alternative,\n                                                                                  PNR, &amp; Dr.GRR,J\n                                                                      CMA Nos.1264 of 2012 &amp; 42 of 2013\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           5                                    &amp; CRP No.2835 of 2016</span>\n\n\n\n\nto direct the respondents to pay sum of Rs.1,36,38,400/- (Rupees\n\none crore thirty six lakhs thirty eight thousand four hundred only)\n\ntogether with the interest at the rate of 18% per annum, from the\n\ndate of filing of arbitration petition; and to direct respondents to\n\npay sum of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees fifty lakhs only) towards\n\nliquidated     damages.         Appellants        herein       were        arrayed                as\n\nrespondents 1 to 16 and second respondent as 17th respondent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">7.    The Arbitrator framed 17 issues.                      In the Award dated\n\n25.9.2009, the Arbitrator rejected the claim against appellants and\n\ngranted relief only against second respondent.

It is a case where R-1 to R-16 had given irrevocable Power of\n     Attorney in regard to share of RW-2 and in Ex.C-2. Hence, RW-2 can be\n     treated as an agent of R1 to R-16 only in regard to share of RW-2 as per\n     EX.C-1 but not in regard to their (R-1 to R-16) share. Hence, there is no\n     force in the contention for the claimant that award has to be passed against\n     R-1 to R-16 by way of charge for the amount that may be ordered as per the\n     award. There is no stipulation to that effect in Ex.C-2. There is no statutory\n     provision for ordering charge in case the claim of refund in regard to\n     construction in joint ventures.

It is further contended that what is sought to be enforced in\n\nE.P., is an order passed by the II Additional Chief Judge in\n\nO.P.No.243 of 2010 which is an order modifying the award. Under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 362</a> of the Act, 1996, only an Award passed by the\n\nArbitrator can be enforced and not the order of the civil Court in\n\nO.P. filed against the award. A cumulative reading of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 34</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_12\">36</a> and <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_13\">373</a> of the Act, 1996 makes it very clear that no such power\n\nis vested in the Civil Court to seek enforcement of an illegal order\n\nand therefore, E.P.No.06 of 2014 is not maintainable against\n\nappellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">\n13.3. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"98965625\" id=\"span_7\">In support of this contention, learned counsel placed\n\nreliance on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/98965625/\" id=\"a_14\">Project Director, National Highways\n\nNo.45 E and 220 National Highways Authority of India Vs.\n\nM.Hakeem</a> and another4.                       According to learned counsel, since\n\nthe order of the Civil Court itself is erroneous, the question of\n\nenforcement of the said order does not arise.\n\n\n13.4. Further, the Development Agreement cum General Power of\n\nAttorney dated 23.10.1999 was unregistered and thus, it has no\n\nlegal sanctity.

According to learned senior counsel Sri E Madan Mohan Rao\n\nappearing for first respondent, the Development Agreement was\n\nexecuted in favour of the first respondent by the Appellants and\n\nsecond respondent jointly.   The first respondent paid Rupees 40\n\nlakhs as caution deposit and incurred huge expenditure to develop\n\nthe property.   Due to illegal cancellation of the Development\n\nAgreement, the first respondent was subjected to huge loss.

If parties to a contract have dispute(s) flowing out of terms of\n\ncontract, they can avail legal remedy to enforce the terms of\n\ncontract, to claim damages, to recover money, etc.             However, in\n\norder to avoid long drawn litigation, they can also set out to resolve\n\nthe dispute(s) by alternative modes, such as, arbitration. Once the\n\ncontract envisages resolution of inter se dispute(s) through the\n\nmedium of arbitration, law requires parties to resort to such mode\n\nonly. A comprehensive statutory framework is put in place by Act,\n\n1996 to regulate resolution of disputes through arbitration. Act,\n\n1996 is a complete code dealing with all aspects of resolution of a\n\ndispute through the medium of arbitration. It is based on the\n                                                                  PNR, &amp; Dr.GRR,J\n                                                      CMA Nos.1264 of 2012 &amp; 42 of 2013\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                 11                             &amp; CRP No.2835 of 2016</span>\n\n\n\n\nbedrock of the principle i.e, least judicial intervention in arbitral\n\nproceedings.     Once the agreement between parties envisage\n\nresolution of a dispute by resorting to arbitration, the Act do not\n\nencourage civil litigation and assigns finality to a dispute after the\n\nArbitrator passes award, and binding on parties to the arbitration,\n\nby creating only a small window to assail the award. However, the\n\nreality is, on everything and anything of arbitration, recourse is\n\nmade to the courts of law defeating the very objective of the Act to\n\nencourage parties to a contract to avail alternative dispute\n\nresolution which can save costs and time and lessen the burden on\n\nCourts of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">20.    Within limited parameters, a party to arbitration proceedings\n\ncan take recourse to legal remedy under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 34</a> of the Act.

It is not an appeal remedy. Primarily, the Courts of law only\n\nto act as guardians to see the arbitrators do not cross the\n\n&#x27;Laksmana rekha&#x27;. When the civil Court/Commercial Court is\n\nsatisfied that right of the petitioner was affected, within the\n\nparameters set out in Section 34 (2),     it can only set aside the\n\naward but in no circumstance it can amend/alter the award.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">21.    <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 34</a> of the Act, 1996 also specifies period within\n\nwhich one can avail the remedy.

Intervention of the court\n        is envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the\n        arbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of\n        the arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the parties free to begin\n        the arbitration again if it is desired. So, the scheme of the provision aims at\n        keeping the supervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can be\n        justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious decision to exclude\n        the court&#x27;s jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer the\n        expediency and finality offered by it.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">                                                   (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98965625\" id=\"span_16\">23.

Secondly, as the marginal note of Section 34\n        indicates, &quot;recourse&quot; to a court against an arbitral award may be made\n        only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with\n        sub-sections (2) and (3). &quot;Recourse&quot; is defined by P. Ramanatha Aiyar&#x27;s\n        Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edn.) as the enforcement or method of\n        enforcing a right. Where the right is itself truncated, enforcement of such\n        truncated right can also be only limited in nature. What is clear from a\n        reading of the said provisions is that, given the limited grounds of challenge\n        under sub-sections (2) and (3), an application can only be made to set aside\n        an award. This becomes even clearer when we see sub-section (4) under\n        which, on receipt of an application under sub-section (1) of Section 34, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">5</span>\n    (2006) 11 SCC 181\n                                                                                    PNR, &amp; Dr.GRR,J\n                                                                        CMA Nos.1264 of 2012 &amp; 42 of 2013\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                             13                                   &amp; CRP No.2835 of 2016</span>\n\n\n\n\n      court may adjourn the Section 34 proceedings and give the Arbitral\n      Tribunal an opportunity to resume the arbitral proceedings or take such\n      action as will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">      Here again, it is important to note that it is the opinion of the Arbitral\n      Tribunal which counts in order to eliminate the grounds for setting aside\n      the award, which may be indicated by the court hearing the Section 34\n      application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">      xxxx\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">      19.

Even\n      otherwise, to state that the judicial trend appears to favour an\n      interpretation that would read into Section 34 a power to modify, revise or\n      vary the award would be to ignore the previous law contained in the 1940\n      Act; as also to ignore the fact that the 1996 Act was enacted based on the\n      UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985 which,\n      as has been pointed out in Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration,\n      makes it clear that, given the limited judicial interference on extremely\n      limited grounds not dealing with the merits of an award, the &quot;limited\n      remedy&quot; under Section 34 is coterminous with the &quot;limited right&quot;, namely,\n      either to set aside an award or remand the matter under the circumstances\n      mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996.&quot;</span></span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">24.

It\n\nonly provides remedy of enforcement of the award passed by the\n\nArbitrator. This is because in a petition under Section 34, the civil\n\nCourt/Commercial Court can either set aside or affirm the award\n\nbut cannot modify/amend/alter.        If a party to a contract having\n\nsecured award from the arbitrator and award has become final, he\n\ncan take recourse to its enforcement under Section 36.                    Thus,\n\nquestion of enforcement would arise only when award is accepted\n\nby the opposite party or is affirmed under Section 34 and appeal\n\nunder Section 37 is dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">32.   <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 37(1)(b)</a> of the Act, 1996 makes the scheme very\n\nclear. It only envisages remedy of appeal against setting aside or\n\nrefusing to set aside award in a petition under Section 34 and does\n\nnot even speak of modification/alteration/amendment in an\n\napplication made under Section 34. Recourse to <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 37</a> of the\n\nAct remedy before this Court is available only against a decision of\n\nthe civil Court in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 34(1)</a> of the Act and not\n\nagainst the award. Act does not envisage remedy of appeal to this\n\nCourt directly against the award of arbitrator. No application was\n\npreferred under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 34</a> of the Act by second respondent\n\nagainst the award and the award has become final in so far as he\n                                                                    PNR, &amp; Dr.GRR,J\n                                                        CMA Nos.1264 of 2012 &amp; 42 of 2013\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  16                              &amp; CRP No.2835 of 2016</span>\n\n\n\n\nis concerned. The cloud of uncertainty created by the civil Court\n\nby modifying the award is cleared by allowing CMA No. 1264 of\n\n2012.

In the case on hand, Execution Petition was filed seeking\n\nenforcement of the award as modified by the Civil Court.
