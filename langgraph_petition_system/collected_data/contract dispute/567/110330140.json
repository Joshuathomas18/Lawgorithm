Gopal, appellant in LPA 408/2013 (hereinafter referred to as\nthe appellant) issued a notice of demand dated 10th September,\n2002 to the respondent in which he claimed to be continuously\nworking with the respondent since July 1994 on the post of Guard\nat a salary of Rs.2,650/-per month. The appellant sought\nreinstatement with backwages.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.      The conciliation proceedings were held before the Assistant\nLabour Commissioner.               The respondent in its reply before\nAssistant Labour Commissioner, denied having ever employed or\nterminated the appellant and stated that the various functions of the\ndepartment were carried out through the contractor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5.      Upon failure of the Conciliation proceedings, the Central\nGovernment referred the following industrial dispute to the learned\nCGIT:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot;Whether the termination of services of S/Shri Harinder\n        Singh, Security Guard w.e.f. of 01.09.2002, Gopal,\n        Security Guard w.e.f. 01.09.2002, Narender, Security\n        Guard w.e.f. 01.02.2002, Bhagat Singh, Security Guard\n        w.e.f. 01.09.2002, Roop Ram, Security Guard w.e.f.\n        01.09.2002, Tejveer, Security Guard w.e.f. 01.09.2002,\n        Sanjay, Security Guard w.e.f. 01.09.2002, Satveer\n        Singh, S/o, Shri Hari Ram, Guard and Shri Sher Singh,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters            Page 8 of 24</span>\n         S/o.

The respondent in its written statement reiterated that they\nnever appointed the appellant and as such, there was no employer -\nemployee relationship between the parties. It was further stated\nthat BSNL had not even been created in 1994 when the appellant\nclaimed to have joined the respondent. It was further stated that\nthe security personnel were hired through the contractor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">8.      The appellant, in his evidence by way of affidavit, reiterated\nthe contentions mentioned above. However, in cross-examination,\nthe appellant contradicted his date of employment set up in the\ndemand notice and statement of claim i.e. July 1994 and deposed\nthat he was engaged in 1996 but he did not remember the month.\nThe appellant denied being employed through three security\ncontractors, namely, Laxman Security Agencies, Keshav Security\nServices and Anuradha Security Services who had provided the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters           Page 9 of 24</span>\n security according to the respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">9.      The respondent&#x27;s AGM(Legal) in his evidence by way of\naffidavit deposed that the appellant was neither employed nor\nterminated by the respondent and there was no employer-employee\nrelationship between the parties. The witness further deposed that\nBSNL was not even created in 1994 and at that time only\nDepartment of Telecom was in existence.        The witness further\ndeposed that nobody was appointed without following the rules.\nThe witness further deposed that the respondent was required to\nengage security personnel from DGR&#x27;s sponsored agency in terms\nof the office memorandum dated 1st February, 1999 issued by the\nDepartment of Public Enterprises, Defence Ministry circular dated\n26th April, 2001 and BSNL memorandum dated 3rd April, 2002.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">10.     The learned CGIT passed a common award dated 4th\nDecember, 2006 holding the appellants to be the employees of the\nrespondent; the termination to be illegal; and the contract between\nthe respondent and the contractor to be sham. The learned CGIT\ndirected reinstatement of the appellants with 50% backwages w.e.f.\n1st September, 2002.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">11.     The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition of the\nrespondent and set aside the common award of CGIT on various\ngrounds inter alia that there was no employer-employee\nrelationship between the parties and the issue as to whether the\ncontract between the respondent and the contractor was sham, was\nnot even referred to the learned Tribunal. The learned Single Judge\nheld the finding of the learned CGIT to be without jurisdiction.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters        Page 10 of 24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"> However, the learned Single Judge granted relief to the appellants\nto the effect that wages under Section 17B received by them after\ntermination to be treated as compensation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">Submissions on behalf of the appellant\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">12.     Learned counsel for the appellants could not dispute that the\nissue as to whether the contract between the respondent and the\ncontractor was sham and bogus, was not at all referred to the\nlearned Tribunal. It was however submitted that the real dispute\nbetween the parties was whether the workmen were the employees\nof the contractor or of the respondent though the reference made to\nthe learned CGIT did not directly address this issue. The reference\nmade by the Central Government is suggestive of issues and is\nsimply framed to give direction to the Tribunal in regard of the\ndispute.

The first question which arises for consideration is whether\nthere was employer-employee relationship between the appellant\nand the respondent?           The appellant claims to have joined the\nrespondent in July 1994 at the post of the Guard but has no proof\nof appointment such as appointment letter, salary slip etc. The\nrespondent disclosed in its written statement that BSNL was not\neven created in 1994. Despite that the appellant deposed in his\nevidence by way of affidavit that he joined in July 1994 which is\nnot possible. However, in cross-examination, the appellant stated\nthat he joined in 1996.            The appellant has also not given the\nparticulars of the places of posting from 1994 to 2002.                    The\nrespondent being a Government Corporation, cannot appoint any\nperson without issuing proper appointment letters and cannot make\npayments without a salary slip. We, therefore, hold that there was\nno employee-employee relationship between the appellants and the\nrespondent.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters               Page 14 of 24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\"> 25.     The next question which arises for consideration is -\nwhether the issue as to &quot;whether the contracts between the\nrespondent and the security agencies were sham or camouflage&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">was referred by the Central Government to the learned CGIT. We\nhave referred to the pleadings of the parties and find that the issue\nas to whether the contract between the respondent and the security\nagencies was sham/camouflage neither arose out of the pleadings\nnor it was referred by the Central Government to the learned CGIT.\nThe case of the appellant in the notice of demand as well as the\nclaim statement was that the appellant joined the respondent in July\n1994 on the post of Guard at a monthly salary of Rs.2,650/- per\nmonth and was terminated on 1st September, 2002 without any\nwritten order. The respondent‟s case was that they never employed\nthe appellant and there was no employer-employee relationship\nbetween the parties. It was further pleaded that since there was no\nrelation of employer-employee, the question of termination would\nnot arise. There is no averment either in the notice of demand or\nthe claim statement that the contract between the respondent and\nthe security agencies was sham and camouflage. The reference of\nthe Central Government is clear as to whether the termination of\nappellant was just and legal. The reference further clearly records\nthat the appellant had been employed through the security\ncontractors but no reference was made as to the legality of the\ncontract between the respondent and the contractors.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">26.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"908660\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/908660/\" id=\"a_11\">Mukand Ltd. v.

We, therefore, hold that the reference is limited to\n        the dispute between the Company and the Workmen\n        employed by them and that the Tribunal, being the\n        creature of the reference, cannot adjudicate matters not\n        within the purview of the dispute actually referred to it\n        by the order of Reference.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"897981\" id=\"span_17\">27.     With respect to the appellants‟ contention that even if the\nquestion relating to the validity of the contract between the\nrespondent and the service contractors was not referred by the\nCentral Government to the learned CGIT, the Industrial Tribunal\nhad jurisdiction to consider the issue. We do not agree with this\nsubmission in view of the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/897981/\" id=\"a_12\">Ashok Kumar v. State</a>\n(supra) in which this Court held that the Labour Courts / Tribunals\ncannot travel beyond the term of reference. This <a href=\"/doc/897981/\" id=\"a_13\">Court further held</a>\nthat if no reference has been made to the Labour Court for\ndetermining whether the contract was sham or camouflage, the\nLabour Court could not have entered into this issue to hold that the\ncontract was sham and camouflage. Relevant portion of <a href=\"/doc/897981/\" id=\"a_14\">the said\njudgment</a> is reproduced hereunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        &quot;5. I consider that this argument of the counsel of the\n        petitioner must fail. The petitioners, before Conciliation\n        Officer as well as before the appropriate Government, did\n        not raise any dispute about the contract being sham and\n        camouflage. They rather claimed that they were direct\n        employees of the management and did not claim that they\n        were employees of the contractor. It is now settled law that\n        where the workmen claim that the contract between\n        principle employer and contractor was sham and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters             Page 16 of 24</span>\n         camouflage, they have to raise an industrial dispute to that\n        effect and it is industrial adjudicator who, after going\n        through the evidence and the terms and conditions of the\n        contract and other circumstances has to decide whether the\n        contract between principal employer and the contractor\n        was sham and camouflage. If the Industrial Adjudicator\n        comes to conclusion that the contract was sham and\n        camouflage, the industrial adjudicator can order the\n        absorption of the workman by the principal employer.\n        Similarly in a case where the workman considered that\n        though they were contractor&#x27;s employees but the contract\n        labour system should be abolished, they have to approach\n        the appropriate Government under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA\n        Act and it is the jurisdiction of the appropriate Government\n        to consider the demand of the workman and after taking into\n        account the parameters, as laid down under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 10</a> of\n        the CLRA Act, issue a notification of abolition of the\n        contract labour system in the industry/establishment in\n        respect of specific jobs. The Tribunal or the High Court\n        cannot exercise powers under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA Act.\n        This power vests with the Government.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        &quot;7. It is obvious that the workmen in this case did not raise\n        correct dispute and did not approach the appropriate\n        Government with the contentions that the contract was sham\n        and camouflage or that the contract labour system should be\n        abolished. They got referred a dispute that they were the\n        employees of the management and were not being\n        regularized. This claim was found false. The Labour Court\n        had no alternative but to dismiss the claim. It is settled law\n        that the Labour Courts/Tribunals cannot travel beyond the\n        term of reference. If no reference had been made to the\n        Labour Court for determining whether the contract was\n        sham and camouflage, the Labour Court could not have\n        entered into this issue and decided whether the contract\n        was sham and camouflage.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">                                                  (Emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">28.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"500391\" id=\"span_19\">In <a href=\"/doc/500391/\" id=\"a_18\">Chhathoo Lal v.

This <a href=\"/doc/500391/\" id=\"a_19\">Court further held</a> that the Labour Court is\na creation of the reference and therefore, cannot go beyond the\nterms of the reference. Relevant portion of <a href=\"/doc/500391/\" id=\"a_20\">the said judgment</a> is as\nunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        &quot;8. In the present case the workman had not raised\n        any contention that the contract entered into between\n        the contractor and the management was a sham. In fact\n        the contention of the workman was that he was an\n        employee of the respondent. The Labour Court could\n        not have gone into the question whether the contract\n        was sham or not because no such reference was made\n        to the Labour Court. The reference made to the Labour\n        Court was that whether the services of the petitioner\n        were illegally terminated or not and the contention of\n        the petitioner was that he was a direct employee of the\n        respondent. I consider that the petitioner should have\n        initially raised a proper dispute. He should have come\n        up with clean hands and submitted that he was an\n        employee of the contractor and the contract should be\n        declared as sham and camouflage and he should be\n        considered as an employee of the principal employer.\n        He did not disclose the true facts and taking a false plea\n        stood in the way of referring the proper dispute to the\n        Labour Court. It is settled law that the Labour Court is\n        a creation of the reference and the Labour Court\n        cannot go beyond the terms of reference except that\n        the questions incidental to the dispute and those, who\n        go to the root to the jurisdiction of Labour Court can\n        be decided by the Labour Court while deciding a\n        reference.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        9. The contention of the counsel of petitioner that the\n        Labour Court could not have gone into the questions of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters          Page 18 of 24</span>\n         relationship of employer- employee does not stand the\n        scrutiny of law. The issue of relationship of employer-\n        employee goes to the root of the jurisdiction of the\n        Labour Court and is incidental to the issue raised by the\n        petitioner that he was illegally terminated by the\n        respondent. If he was not an employee of the respondent\n        there could have been no question of his illegal\n        termination the question of his illegal termination would\n        arise only if he was an employee of the respondent.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        10. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1504350\" id=\"span_23\">In <a href=\"/doc/1504350/\" id=\"a_21\">A.P.SRTC and Ors. v.

The Supreme Court upheld the award of the Labour\nCourt.</span> This judgment does not help the appellant as there is no\nemployer-employee relationship between the parties in the present\ncase and therefore, Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act\ncannot be resorted to.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">35.     The appellant has next relied upon General Manager, Oil\nand Natural Gas Commission, Silchar v. Oil and Natural Gas\nCommission Contractual Workers Union (supra) in which the\nworkers were held to be the employees of ONGC as the wages\nwere being paid by ONGC; there was no contractor appointed by\nONGC; ONGC used to supervise and allot works to individual\nworkers; ONGC took disciplinary action and called for explanation\nfrom the workers and therefore, it was held that there was\nrelationship of master and servant.            In the present case, the\nappellant could not produce any evidence whatsoever to prove the\nrelationship of employer and employee either with the respondent\nor within the contractor and therefore, this judgment would not\nhelp the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505590\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13482\" id=\"span_35\">36.     We agree with the respondent that the respondent being a\ngovernment organization cannot make any appointment without\nissuing appointment letter and without following the due process of\nlaw and therefore, the appellants‟ contention that they were\nappointed without issuance of any appointment letter does not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters              Page 22 of 24</span>\n appear to be true. We also agree with the respondent that irregular\nappointees have no right to post as held in <a href=\"/doc/13482/\" id=\"a_38\">Umarani v. Registrar,\nCooperative</a>, (2004) 7 SCC 112, Accounts Officer (A&amp;I) ors. v.\n<a href=\"/doc/505590/\" id=\"a_39\">K.V. Ramana, (2007) 2 SCC 324 and Indian Drugs &amp;\nPharmaceuticals v.

We agree with the respondent that the onus to prove the\nrelationship of employer-employee was on the appellant as held by\nthe Supreme Court in Workmen of Niligiri Coop. Mkt. <a href=\"/doc/1506370/\" id=\"a_40\">Society\nLtd. v. State of Tamil Nadu</a> (supra). The appellant could not\nproduce appointment letter or any other document to show the\nrelationship of employer and employee. The document relating to\nthe attendance sheet is not sufficient to prove the relationship of\nemployer and employee as the worker, through the contractor,\nwould be posted at different places and would not become the\nemployee of all the places where they are posted.\nConclusion</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">38.     On careful consideration of the rival contentions of the\nparties, we are of the view that the appellants have not proved the\nrelationship of employer and employee. The appellants have not\nproduced any document to prove the employment. The respondent\nbeing a Public Sector Undertaking cannot employ any person\nwithout issuance of appointment letter and maintaining proper\nrecords of the wages. We agree with the learned Single Judge that\nthe issue as to whether the contract between the respondent and the\ncontractors were sham and camouflage, was not even referred to\nthe learned Tribunal. The learned Tribunal was, therefore, clearly\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">LPA No.408/2013 with other connected matters         Page 23 of 24</span>\n in error in giving a finding with respect to the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">39.     We do not find any infirmity in the impugned judgment and\nagree with the findings of the learned Single Judge. We also note\nthat the appellants have received wages in the range of\nRs.3,00,000/- under <a href=\"/doc/770112/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 17B</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act\nwhich is treated as compensation and the appellants are therefore\nnot liable to return the same. This is sufficient compensation to the\nappellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">40.     There is no merit in the appeals which are hereby dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">41.     Pending applications also stand dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">                                                     J.R.
