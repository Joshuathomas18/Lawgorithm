Again,   the\n\n          Superintending Engineer had requested the then Engineer-in-\n\n          Chief to sanction the amount, as the enquiry report in prescribed\n\n          format is being sent for obtaining approval of Law Department.\n\n          It is further submitted that after the repeated request made by\n\n          the Executive Engineer and the Superintending Engineer, the\n\n          funds has not been allocated for payment to the opposite party\n\n          in terms of the Award.

Even thereafter, no payment was made to the\n\n          opposite party for want of allotment of fund by the higher\n\n          authority of the department. It is further contended that after\n\n          great persuasion by the opposite party, the Executive Engineer\n\n          vide letter dated 11.05.2016 had requested the Engineer in-Chief\n\n          to make allotment of required fund.

The said Award was passed on 01.03.2016 in\n\n          presence of learned counsel for the petitioner who had\n\n          knowledge about the passing of the Award. It is further\n\n          submitted that the explanation for condonation of huge delay\n\n          does not contain acceptable and plausible reason. It appears\n\n          from the pleading of the limitation petition that the petitioners\n\n          have failed to explain the delay. They have also failed to give\n\n          plausible and acceptable reason for the delay in filing the\n\n          Revision application. It is admitted fact that the Award was\n\n          pronounced in the presence of learned counsel for the\n\n          petitioners. The instant revision application has been filed on\n\n          11.10.2017 after 477 days (1 year 3 months 22 days). The\n\n          petitioner has failed to give sufficient explanation for\n\n          condonation of delay in filing the instant Civil Revision\n\n          application. It is apparent from the limitation petition, the Award\n\n          dated 01.03.2016 was communicated through Secretary of the\n\n          Arbitration Tribunal which was received on 17.03.2016.

It is\n\n          further submitted that condonation of delay is an exception and\n\n          should not be used as an anticipated benefit for Government\n\n          departments. It is also submitted that Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court as\n\n          well as this Court have already held that &quot;The government\n\n          departments are under a special obligation to ensure that they\n\n          perform       their     duties     with      diligence   and   commitment.\n\n          Condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as\n\n          an anticipated benefit for the government departments. The law\n\n          shelters everyone under the same light and should not be\n\n          swirled for the benefit of a few&quot;. It is held that the claim on\n\n          account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic\n\n          methodology of making several notes cannot be accepted in\n\n          view of the modern technologies being used and available. The\n\n          law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody, including the\n\n          Government. It is further submitted that the petitioner again\n\n          acted leisurely and claim condonation of delay as a matter of\n\n          fact only because the petitioners are the officers of the\n\n          Government department.

Learned senior counsel for the opposite party has\n\n          submitted that the averments made in the limitation petition are\n\n          vague, misleading and incorrect. It is admitted fact that the\n\n          Award dated 25.10.2016 passed in Reference Case No. 152 of\n\n          2014 was delivered in presence of both the parties. The\n\n          Petitioners cannot deny that they had no knowledge about such\n\n          Award dated 25.10.2016 before 01.12.2016.

It appears\n\n          from the record that the requisition for obtaining certified copy\n\n          of the same Award was filed on 16.10.2017 much after expiry of\n\n          limitation period and the same was delivered on 16.10.2017.\n\n          The petitioners have also failed to give the reason for the delay\n\n          in obtaining certified copy while the said Award was passed on\n\n          25.10.2016 in presence of the petitioners. It is also contended\n\n          that the petitioners have not given plausible explanation for the\n\n          delay and the petitioners have also failed to annex the required\n\n          documents in support of the averments made in the limitation\n\n          petition.

It is contended that on 14.09.2016, the\n\n          Superintending Engineer sent the file to the Chief Engineer for\n\n          guidelines in view of letter dated 05.09.2016 of Executive\n\n          Engineer and in turn, the Engineer-in-Chief vide letter dated\n\n          23.09.2016 sent the file to the Executive Engineer. The\n\n          Executive Engineer sent the file to the panel Advocate of the\n\n          Department for preparing the ground of appeal/revision for\n\n          filing revision application. The said panel lawyer returned the\n\n          file to the Executive Engineer on 03.10.2016 along with the\n\n          grounds of revision application.

The approval for filing of revision\n\n          application was sought by the Superintending Engineer on\n\n          24.10.2017 by the Chief Engineer. On 15.12.2016, the Chief\n\n          Engineer directed the Executive Engineer to obtain the certified\n\n          copy of the impugned Award and send the same. In compliance\n\n          of the said direction, the Executive Engineer applied requisition\n\n          for obtaining certified copy of the said Award on 06.12.2016.\n\n          The said Award was supplied on 07.12.2016. It is further\n\n          pleaded that due to procedural formalities, the limitation period\n\n          for filing of revision application has elapsed. The Executive\n Patna High Court C.R.

Further, it is admitted by the petitioners that the\n\n          impugned Award was received on 29.09.2016 sent by the office\n\n          of Arbitration Tribunal.

It is further\n\n          contended that the file was locked in the Almirah and the\n\n          Advocate&#x27;s Clerk inadvertently kept the file alongwith other\n\n          files in a bundle. The said file got tied up with other files and\n\n          only in the month of September, 2018, when officer of the\n\n          department approached the office of AAG-4, then on search, the\n\n          file was located on 28.09.2018.

It is contended that\n\n          the explanation for condonation of delay does not contain any\n\n          acceptable and plausible reason. It is further contended that it is\n\n          admitted by the petitioners that the Award dated 22.11.2016\n\n          was received by the Section Officer on 06.12.2016 itself.

It is\n\n          further contended that it is the usual explanation that the file\n\n          was kept pending for several months and time was consumed in\n\n          procedural formalities and also the file was kept in the Almirah\n\n          of the office of the advocates for several months.

The department misled this Court by\n\n          making false statements. As such, the petitioners are not entitled\n\n          to equitable reliefs for condonation of delay. It is well settled\n\n          that whoever has approached the court with unclean hands, as in\n\n          the instant case, no equitable relief can be granted to such unfair\n\n          litigants. It is also contended that the petitioners have no\n\n          explanation or sufficient reason for delay in filing the present\n\n          revision application except saying that delay has occurred due to\n\n          movement of file from one office to another office. It is\n Patna High Court C.R.

The statement made by the petitioners is\n\n          totally misleading, laxity on the part of petitioner as well as\n\n          casualness of the petitioners. It is further contended that the\n\n          Apex Court as well as this Court has already held that &quot;the\n\n          Government departments are under a special obligation to\n\n          ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and\n\n          commitment. Condonation of delay is an exception and should\n\n          not be used as as an anticipated benefit for Government\n\n          departments. The law shelters everyone under the same light\n\n          and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few&quot;. In such\n\n          view of the matter, the huge delay of 3 years 9 months 16 days\n\n          cannot be condoned in the interest of justice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">                         Re: I.A.

Thereafter, on 14.09.2018 he applied for obtaining\n\n          certified copy of Award dated 04.11.2015 passed in Reference\n\n          Case No. 61 of 2012. The same was supplied on the same day.\n\n          After perusal of the said Award dated 04.11.2015 passed by the\n\n          learned Arbitration Tribunal, it was decided to challenge the\n\n          Award of Arbitration Tribunal and before this Court by way of\n\n          filing Civil Revision application. Accordingly, statement of facts\n\n          and grounds for filing Revision application was prepared and\n\n          the same was put up before the authority concerned on\n\n          19.11.2018 for sanction. After preparation of Civil Revision\n\n          application, the file along with draft was sent for vetting and\n\n          after completing the procedure, the file was sent to the\n\n          Secretary-cum-Legal            Remembrance   on   11.12.2018.

Thereafter, the present Revision\n\n          application has been filed on 06.02.2019. It is further submitted\n\n          that petitioners had no knowledge about the Award dated\n\n          04.11.2015 passed in Reference Case No. 61 of 2012 and there\n\n          is no deliberate or intentional laches on the part of the\n\n          petitioners.

Learned counsel for the opposite party appeared\n\n          suo moto and filed his rejoinder to the interlocutory application\n\n          and vehemently opposed the condonation of delay in filing the\n\n          instant Revision application. It is further contended that the\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/164253420/\" id=\"a_17\">Bihar Public Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal Act,\n\n          2008</a> was enacted with the object of expeditious redressal of the\n\n          dispute and as such, while considering the application for\n\n          condonation of delay, the object of the Act is of paramount\n\n          consideration. The remedy against the Award passed by the\n\n          Tribunal is provided under <a href=\"/doc/11667545/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 13</a> of the Bihar Public Works\n\n          Contracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal Act, 2008 whereby any\n\n          party aggrieved by the Award may file Revision application\n\n          within 3 months from the date of Award while the present\n\n          application has been filed after about 3 years of expiry of\n\n          limitation period of 90 days. It is further contended that\n\n          petitioners were party in Reference Case No. 61 of 2012\n\n          represented through the counsel and they filed their reply in the\n\n          said Reference Case. Moreover, the said impugned Award was\n\n          passed by the Arbitration Tribunal in presence of learned\n\n          counsels for the parties after notifying the case &#x27;For Orders&#x27; and\n Patna High Court C.R. No.9 of 2017(32) dt.01-05-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                            46/66</span>\n\n\n\n\n          in such view of the matter petitioners cannot take plea that they\n\n          had no knowledge about the passing of the Award. There is no\n\n          plausible explanation for delay in the instant application. The\n\n          said Award was passed after hearing the parties and it is not an\n\n          ex parte Award. It is pertinent to mention that the petitioners\n\n          have themselves stated that they had learnt about the Execution\n\n          case on 28.05.2018 itself therefore their statement that they\n\n          learnt about the Award on 14.09.2018 is patently false. It is\n\n          further contended that the deponent in order to get order of\n\n          condonation of delay in favour of petitioner, has made false\n\n          statement in limitation petition and as such the petitioners are\n\n          not entitled to equitable relief in the nature of condonation of\n\n          delay as it is well settled that if the party approaches the Court\n\n          with unclean hands, as in the present case, no equitable relief\n\n          can be granted to such unfair litigants. Petitioners have not\n\n          furnished sufficient cause of delay in filing of the present\n\n          Revision application except saying that delay has occurred due\n\n          to movement of file from one office to another. It is further\n\n          contended that the State and its officers cannot be treated\n\n          differently while considering the prayer of condonation of delay.\n\n          The petitioners have miserably failed to give any acceptable and\n\n          cogent reason which may be sufficient to condone the delay of\n Patna High Court C.R.

In support of their cases, learned counsel for the\n\n          petitioners, in all cases, submitted his common submission\n\n          placing the relevant citations for consideration of condonation\n\n          of delay in filing the Revision applications.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"79280249\" id=\"span_48\">55. Learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon the\n\n          decision reported in 2023 (10) SCC 531 (Sheo Raj Singh (d)\n\n          through Lrs. &amp; <a href=\"/doc/79280249/\" id=\"a_19\">Ors.

Union of India and Anr</a>) wherein the\n\n          Apex Court has held in para 35.2 &quot;the expression &quot;sufficient\n\n          cause&quot; is elastic enough for courts to do substantial justice.\n\n          35.3. It is upon the courts to consider the sufficiency of cause\n\n          shown for the delay, and the length of delay is not always\n\n          decisive while exercising discretion in such matters if the delay\n\n          is properly explained. 35.4. It is further held that a distinction\n\n          should be drawn between inordinate unexplained delay and\n\n          explained delay, where in the present case, the first respondent\n\n          had sufficiently explained the delay on account of negligence on\n\n          part of the government functionaries and the government\n\n          counsel on record before the Reference Court. 41. An exercise of\n\n          jurisdiction does, at times, call for liberal and justice oriented\n\n          approach by the courts where certain leeway could be provided\n\n          to the State.

Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that\n\n          due to special circumstances which were beyond the control of\n\n          the State authorities some time was consumed in taking\n\n          procedural formalities. It was further urged that delay may be\n\n          condoned as the interest of State would be jeopardized and\n\n          whatever be the laches were, they were neither willful nor\n\n          deliberate. In this context, learned counsel for the petitioners has\n\n          drawn the attention of this Court to a decision of the Apex Court\n\n          reported in 2015 (3) SCC 569 (Executive Officer, Antiyur Town\n\n          Panchayat vs.. G. Arumugam (D) By Lrs., wherein, the Apex\n\n          Court condoned the delay of 1373 days in filing the appeal.\n\n          Learned counsel submitted that in the interest of justice and\n\n          keeping in view the larger interest, the court should take lenient\n\n          view and condone the delay howsoever, the huge may be the\n\n          delay. Learned counsel(s) further relied upon a decision in the\n\n          case of Maniben Devraj Shah vs. Municipal Corporation of\n\n          Brihan Mumbai reported in 2012 (5) SCC 157. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1240908\" id=\"span_50\">In the aforesaid\n\n          decision, the Apex Court in paragraph 18 has relied upon a\n Patna High Court C.R.

They are meant to see that parties do not resort\n\n          to dilatory tactics, but seek their remedy promptly. In paragraph\n\n          13 of the aforesaid judgment, the Apex Court has held that while\n\n          condoning the delay, the court should not forget the opposite\n\n          party altogether. It must be borne in mind that he is a loser and\n\n          he too would have incurred quite large litigation expenses.

The\n\n          said judgment arises out of a criminal appeal. The State\n\n          preferred appeal against acquittal and application for grant of\n\n          leave was made in terms of <a href=\"/doc/613293/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 378 (3)</a> of the Code of\n\n          Criminal Procedure, 1973 as there was delay in making the\n\n          application for grant of leave in terms of <a href=\"/doc/613293/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 378(3)</a> of the\n\n          Cr.P.C., application for condoning the delay was filed.

The High Court refused to\n\n          condone the delay of 57 days on the ground that it is a duty of\n\n          litigant to file appeal before expiry of limitation period. Merely\n\n          because the Additional Advocate General did not file an appeal\n\n          inspite of instructions issued to him that did not constitute\n\n          sufficient cause and further the fact that the records were\n\n          purportedly missing was not valid ground. Consequently, the\n\n          application for grant of leave was rejected by the High Court.\n\n          The Apex Court condoned the delay of 57 days in filing the\n Patna High Court C.R.

In all cases, the requisitions for certified copy of\n\n          Awards have been filed by the petitioners after long delay of the\n\n          prescribed period for filing the revision applications. It is\n\n          apparent from the limitation petitions filed in the aforesaid\n\n          revision applications that there was delay at every stage and\n\n          there is no plausible explanation except mentioning the dates of\n\n          movement of files. The matter has been dealt with by the\n\n          Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in detail in the case of Government of\n\n          Maharashtra (Water Resources Department) represented by\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/43419081/\" id=\"a_30\">Executive Engineer Vs.

Besides, the expression &quot;sufficient cause&quot; is not\n\n          itself a loose panacea for the ill of pressing negligent and stale\n\n          claims.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"884460\" id=\"span_72\">The Apex Court has relied upon the decision in the case\n\n          of <a href=\"/doc/884460/\" id=\"a_32\">Basawaraj Vs.

The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court further quoted policy of\n\n          Limitation Acts and unlimited limitation would lead to a sense\n\n          of insecurity and uncertainty, and therefore, limitation prevents\n\n          disturbances or deprivation of what any have acquired in equity\n\n          and justice by long enjoyment or what may have been lost by a\n\n          party&#x27;s own inaction, negligence or laches. It has been further\n\n          held in the case of P. Ramachandra Rao Vs. State of Karnatka\n\n          reported in (2002) 4 SCC 578, by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court held\n\n          that judicially engrafting principles of limitation amounts to\n\n          legislating and would fly in the face of law laid down by the\n\n          Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/1200243/\" id=\"a_33\">Abdul Rehman Antulay Vs. R.S. Nayak</a>\n\n          reported in (1992) 1 SCC 225. It has been further quoted that\n\n          law on the issue can be summarized to the effect that where a\n\n          case has been presented in the court beyond limitation, the\n\n          applicant has to explain the court as to what was the &quot;sufficient\n\n          cause&quot; which means an adequate and enough reason which\n\n          prevented him to approach the Court within limitation.

Having considered the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n          Apex Court and materials on records, it is apparent that there is\n\n          no sufficient explanation except mentioning the movement of\n\n          files from one stage to another and a lame excuse. In limitation\n\n          petitions filed in Civil Revision Nos. 194 of 2018 &amp; 9 of 2019.\n\n          Same grounds have been taken for explaining the delay in filing\n\n          the aforesaid two civil revision applications in which the\n Patna High Court C.R. No.9 of 2017(32) dt.01-05-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                            64/66</span>\n\n\n\n\n          deponents stated that files were sent to the office of learned\n\n          Advocate General on 16.12.2016 and 28.03.2017 respectively.\n\n          The said files were kept in the bunch of regular cases by mistake\n\n          of Advocate&#x27;s Clerk of the concerned panel lawyers due to\n\n          which the said civil revision applications could not be filed in\n\n          time. The said revision applications were filed on 20.12.2018\n\n          and 15.01.2019. It is pertinent to mention that the said files were\n\n          located on 05.10.2018 and 28.09.2018 respectively while both\n\n          the revision applications were filed after 2 months 14 days and 3\n\n          months 16 days respectively. In another revision application i.e.\n\n          Civil Revision No. 20 of 2019, the plea has been taken that the\n\n          petitioners were not dealing with the matter in Reference Case.\n\n          The said work was being carried out by Road Construction\n\n          Department, NH Division, Aurangabad, and on 22.09.2015, the\n\n          work was handed over to NH Division, Gulzarbagh. This plea is\n\n          apparently false and misleading. It is apparent from the Award\n\n          dated 20.01.2015 passed by the Arbitration Tribunal in\n\n          Reference Case No. 102 of 2011 that the petitioners were one of\n\n          the opposite parties of the Award under challenge. Moreover, the\n\n          petitioners also filed rejoinder to the claim of the opposite party\n\n          in the said Reference case. The said petitioners have not come\n\n          with clean hand.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\"> Patna High Court C.R.

In all Awards, the\n\n          learned Arbitration Tribunal has passed the order in presence of\n\n          the petitioners. No ex parte order or Award was passed. In such\n\n          view of the matter, it is apparent that there was lack of bona fide\n\n          effort. The petitioners filed the revision applications after\n\n          inordinate delay i.e., much after the prescribed time and there\n\n          was complete lack of due diligence by the petitioners in taking\n\n          steps for filing the aforesaid revision applications.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">                       71. Having considered the judgments of the Apex\n\n          Court as well as the principles laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n          Supreme Court and materials on record of the case, it is\n\n          apparent that there was delay at every stage and there is no\n\n          explanation except mentioning the dates of movement of files.\n\n          Even according to the petitioners, due information and copy of\n\n          the Award was sent by the Arbitration Tribunal within\n\n          prescribed period. Further, all the petitioners were represented\n\n          through their learned counsels before the Tribunal and the\n\n          Awards of the said cases were passed in presence of the\n\n          counsels of the petitioners.
