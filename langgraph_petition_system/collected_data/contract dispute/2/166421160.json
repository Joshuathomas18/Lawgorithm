If   this   Court   compares   the   provisions   of   the \n\n\n\n  M.P.   Act   with   A.C.   Act   1996   then   the   Court   finds \n\n\n\n  that   the   provisions   of   M.P.

Under   the   provisions   of \n\n\n\n  A.C.   Act   1996   in   the   absence   of   an   arbitration \n\n\n\n  agreement,   arbitration   is   not   possible.

But under M.P. \n\n\n\n  Act   such   a   tribunal   is   created   under   <a href=\"/doc/686376/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections   3</a>   and \n\n\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/354344/\" id=\"a_20\">4</a>   of   the   Act.

The   Tribunal   is   not   one   which   can \n\n      be   said   to   be   a   domestic   tribunal.   The \n\n      Members   of   the   Tribunal   are   not   nominated   by \n\n      the   parties.   The   disputants   do   not   have   any \n\n      control   over   their   appointment.   The   Tribunal \n\n      may   reject   a   reference   at   the   threshold.   It \n\n      has   the   power   to   summon   records.   It   has   the \n\n      power   to   record   evidence.   Its   functions   are \n\n      not limited to one Bench. The Chairman of the \n\n      Tribunal   can   refer   the   disputes   to   another \n\n      Bench.   Its   decision   is   final.   It   can   award \n\n      costs.   It   can   award   interests.

On   perusal   of   the   aforesaid   provision   enumerated   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 7</a>, it is explicitly clear that the matter in the event of  existence of a \n\n\ndispute between the parties in certain categories of cases where the State  \n\n\nof Madhya Pradesh is a contracting party, the dispute  shall be referred  in  \n\n\nwriting   to   the   tribunal   irrespective   of   the   fact   whether   the   agreement \n\n\ncontains   an   arbitration   clause   or   not.     From   this   provision     it   is   clearly \n\n\napparent   that   reference   of   any   dispute   to   the   tribunal   postulates     an \n\n\nexistence of a works contract and the definition of  `works contract&#x27; under  \n\n\nSection 2 (i)  of the  M.P.

We  \n\n\nmay   therefore   meticulously   recollect   the   definition   of   `works   contract&#x27; \n\n\nwhich lays down as follows:- \n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">           &quot;works   contract&quot;    means     an   agreement     in   writing     for   the \n\n           execution   of     any   work   relating   to   construction,   repair   or \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                               29</span>\n\n\f\n           maintenance of any building or superstructure, dam, weir, canal, \n\n           reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory workshop, \n\n           powerhouse,   transformers   or   such   other   works   of   the   State  \n\n           Government     or   Public   Undertaking   as   the   State   Government \n\n           may,   by  notification,   specify  in   this   behalf     at   any  of   its   stages, \n\n           entered   into   by   the   State   Government   or   by   an   official   of   the \n\n           State Government or Public Undertaking or its official for and on  \n\n           behalf of such Public Undertaking and includes an agreement for  \n\n           the supply   of goods or material and all other matters relating to  \n\n           the execution of any of the said works.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">5.             Thus   on   a   perusal     of   the   definition   of   `works   contract&#x27;,   it   is \n\n\nmanifestly   clear     that   while   the   `works   contract&#x27;   means   an   agreement  \n\n\npertaining   to   matters   relating     to   the   execution   of   any   of     the   work \n\n\nenumerated     in   the   definition     of   `works   contract&#x27;,   the   same   does   not \n\n\ninclude  the dispute  pertaining  to  termination, cancellation or repudiation  \n\n\nof   works   contract   and   the   entire   nature   of   transaction   laid   down   therein \n\n\nrelates   to   disputes   which     arise   out   of   execution   of   the   nature   of   work  \n\n\nspecified   in   the   `works   contract&#x27;.     However,   the   question   whether   the  \n\n\n`works contract&#x27; has been legally repudiated and rightly cancelled or not is  \n\n\nthe question or dispute   pertaining   to termination of works contract has \n\n\nnot   been     incorporated   even   remotely   within   the   definition   of   `works  \n\n\ncontract&#x27;.  In view of this, the legal and logical consequence which can be \n\n\nreasonably drawn from the definition of  `works contract&#x27; would be,  that if  \n\n\nthere is a dispute between the contracting parties  for any reason  relating  \n\n\nto     works   contract   which   include   execution   of     any   work,   relating   to \n\n\nconstruction,   repair   or   maintenance   of   any   building   or   super-structure, \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                30</span>\n\n\f\ndam, weir, canal, reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory,  \n\n\nworkshop,   power   house,   transformers   or   such   other   works   of   the   State  \n\n\nGovernment     or     Public   Undertaking   including   an   agreement     for   the \n\n\nsupply   of   goods     or   material   and     all       other     matters   relating   to   the  \n\n\nexecution  of any of the said works, the same would fall within the ambit of  \n\n\nthe   definition   of   `works   contract&#x27;     and   hence     all   disputes   pertaining   or  \n\n\narising out of  execution  of the works contract will have to be  referred to  \n\n\nthe M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal   as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 7</a> of the  \n\n\nAct of 1983.   Hence, in addition to the reasons assigned in the judgment  \n\n\nand   order   of   learned   Brother   Justice   Ganguly,   disputes   arising   out   of \n\n\nexecution of works contract has to be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration  \n\n\nTribunal and not under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_49\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">6.             But   in   so   far   as   the   instant   matter   is   concerned,   the   facts  \n\n\ndisclose   that   the   appellant   M.P.   Rural   Road   Development   Authority \n\n\ncancelled the   works contract itself   which was  executed in favour of the  \n\n\nrespondent.  In that event, the works contract between the parties was not  \n\n\nin   existence   at   all   which   would   operate   as   a   statutory   mandate   for  \n\n\nreference of the dispute to the M.P.

It is no doubt true  that if the matter were before an  Arbitrator \n\n\nappointed under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_50\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> for adjudication \n\n\nof     any   dispute   including     the   question   regarding     the   justification   and \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                               31</span>\n\n\f\nlegality     as   to   whether   the   cancellation   of   works   contract   was   legal   or \n\n\nillegal, then   the said Arbitrator in view of the ratio of the judgment of the  \n\n\nSupreme   Court       in    <a href=\"/doc/821814/\" id=\"a_51\">Maharshi     Dayanand   University   &amp;   Anr.

Anand  \n\n\nCo-op L(C) Society</a>, 2007 (5) SCC 295, as also  in view of the persuasive \n\n\nreasoning assigned in the judgment and order reported in Heyman &amp; Anr.</span>  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">Vs. Darwins, Limited, 1942 (1) All E.R. 337 would have had the jurisdiction \n\n\nto   adjudicate   the   dispute     regarding     the   justification     and   legality   of  \n\n\ncancellation of works contract also.   But the same cannot be   allowed to  \n\n\nbe   raised   under   the   M.P.   Act   of   1983   since   the   definition   of   `works  \n\n\ncontract&#x27;    unambiguously   lays  down   in  explicit  terms    as  to what  is  the \n\n\nnature and scope of `works contract&#x27; and further enumerates the specific  \n\n\nnature   of   disputes   arising   out   of   the   execution   of   works   contract   which  \n\n\nwould come within the definition of a `works contract&#x27;.   \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">8.             However,  the same does not even vaguely include  the issue \n\n\nor dispute arising  out of   cancellation and termination  of contract due to \n\n\nwhich     this  question,   in  my  considered  opinion,   would   not   fall  within  the  \n\n\njurisdiction   of     M.P.   State   Arbitration   Tribunal   so   as     to   be   referred   for \n\n\nadjudication     arising   out   of   its   termination.     As   already   stated,   fall   out  \n\n\ncertainly  would   be   otherwise  if   the   matter  were   to   be   adjudicated   by   an  \n\n\nArbitrator appointed under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_52\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and  \n\n\nthat would be   in view of the ratio of the decisions of the Supreme Court \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                               32</span>\n\n\f\nreferred to hereinbefore which has held it   permissible   for the Arbitrator  \n\n\nto adjudicate  even the dispute arising out of cancellation or termination of  \n\n\nan agreement   or contract.   This however, cannot be allowed to broaden  \n\n\nor expand  the ambit  and scope of the M.P. Act of  1983 where the State \n\n\nLegislature     has   passed   a   specific   legislation   in   respect   of   certain \n\n\nspecified   types   of   arbitration   determining   as   to   what   are   the   nature   of \n\n\ndisputes   to   be   referred   to   the   M.P.   State   Arbitration   Tribunal   and   that  \n\n\nspecifically   permits   the   reference   of   dispute   arising   out   of   execution   of \n\n\ncontract     but   clearly   leaves   out   any   dispute     arising   out   of     termination, \n\n\ncancellation or repudiation of `works  contract&#x27;.  In order to clarify the point  \n\n\nfurther,     what   needs   to   be       emphasized   is   that   if   the   nature   of   dispute  \n\n\nreferred   to   the     Arbitrator     like     the   instant   matter,   related   to   a   dispute  \n\n\npertaining     to   construction,   repair,   maintenance   of   any   building     super-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">structure,   dam   or   for   the   reasons   stated   within   the   definition   of     `works  \n\n\ncontract&#x27;, the matter may be referred to the M.P. Tribunal   in view of the \n\n\nfact that if there  is  a dispute in relation to execution of a works contract,  \n\n\nthen   irrespective   of   the   fact   whether     the   agreement   contains   an \n\n\narbitration clause or not, the dispute is required to be referred to the M.P.  \n\n\nState   Arbitration   Tribunal   for   adjudication.     But   when   the   contract     itself  \n\n\nhas been terminated, cancelled  or repudiated  as it has happened in the \n\n\ninstant case, then the nature of dispute does not   fall within the definition  \n\n\nof `works contract&#x27; for  the sole reason that it does not include any dispute \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                 33</span>\n\n\f\npertaining   to   cancellation   of   a   works   contract   implying   that     when   the \n\n\nworks  contract itself   is not in existence by virtue of its cancellation, the \n\n\ndispute cannot  be  referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal but  may \n\n\nhave to be decided by an Arbitrator appointed under the   <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_53\">Arbitration and  \n\n\nConciliation Act, 1996</a>. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">9.             Hence,     the   nature   of   the   dispute   which   falls   within   the  \n\n\ndefinition  of     `works   contract&#x27;     under   Section   2(i)     of   the   M.P.   Act,   1983  \n\n\nand one of the contracting parties to the agreement is the State of M.P.,  \n\n\nthen  irrespective  of  an  arbitration  agreement  the  dispute  will   have  to  be  \n\n\nreferred to the   Tribunal in terms of   <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 7</a> of the Act of 1983.   But if  \n\n\nthe works contract itself has been repudiated  and hence not in existence  \n\n\nat all by virtue  of its cancellation/termination,  then in my considered view,  \n\n\nthe   dispute   will   have   to   be     referred   to   an   independent   arbitrator   to   be  \n\n\nappointed under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_55\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> since the M.P. \n\n\nAct   1983   envisages   reference   of   a   dispute   to   the   State   Tribunal   only   in  \n\n\nrespect of certain specified types of arbitration enumerated under Section \n\n\n2 (i) of the M.P. Act, 1983.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">10.            As   a   consequence   and   fall   out     of   the   aforesaid   discussion,  \n\n\nthe impugned order of the High Court by which   the dispute   relating   to \n\n\ntermination     of   works   contract   by   the   M.P.   Rural   Road   Development \n\n\nAuthority itself was referred to an independent arbitrator  appointed by the  \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                34</span>\n\n\f\nHigh Court under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_56\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> needs to be  \n\n\nsustained  and there is no need for  a de novo  reference of the dispute to \n\n\nthe M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal.     In the alternative, the consequence \n\n\nwould have been otherwise and the matter could have been   referred to \n\n\nthe State Arbitration Tribunal  if the dispute between the parties  related to \n\n\nany dispute  emerging  out of execution of works contract which could fall \n\n\nwithin  the  definition  of  `works   contract&#x27;  given  out    within  the  definition  of \n\n\n`works contract&#x27; under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Act of 1983.     In order to  \n\n\navoid   any   ambiguity,   it   is   reiterated     that   in   view     of   cancellation   of   the  \n\n\nworks   contract   itself       which   is   the   position   in   the   instant   case,   the  \n\n\nproceedings before the Arbitrator  appointed by the High Court cannot be  \n\n\ntreated as  non-est    so as to refer the same once again to the tribunal for \n\n\nadjudication   as   the   dispute   does   not   emerge   or   pertain   to   execution   of \n\n\nworks contract but  relates to non-existence of works contract by virtue  of  \n\n\nits cancellation.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">11.            Thus the sum and substance of what I wish  to emphasize is \n\n\nthat the question as to whether the dispute would  be  referred to the M.P.  \n\n\nTribunal     in   terms   of   Section   7   of   the   M.P.
