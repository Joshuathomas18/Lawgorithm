Briefly stated the factual matrix of the case as stated in the present\n                               petition is that in March 2020, upon the outbreak of the COVID-19\n                               pandemic and subsequent governmental restrictions aviation operations\n                               were severely disrupted. Consequently, MIAL issued a Force Majeure\n                               notice on 17.03.2020 under <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 16</a> of the OMDA, claiming that the\n                               pandemic constituted a Force Majeure event from 13.03.2020. MIAL\n                               sought suspension of its Annual Fee (‗AF&#x27;) obligations, citing an\n                               adverse financial impact. The said notice was responded by AAI on\n                               24.03.2020, requesting MIAL to provide a Business Plan reflecting the\n                               financial impact of the pandemic. On the same day, MIAL requested\n                               AAI to instruct SBI within 24 hours to halt transfers from the Proceeds\n                               Account to the AAI Fee Account and instead transfer funds to the\n                               Surplus Account for operational expenses. AAI, in its reply dated\n                               25.03.2020, pointed out that MIAL&#x27;s request for a 24-hour response\n                               was inconsistent with the 15-day response period stipulated in the\n                               OMDA and sought financial records to substantiate MIAL&#x27;s force\n                               majeure claims.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">                          6.   On 26.03.2020, MIAL submitted financial statements showing its fund\n                               position and urgent pending payments but failed to provide supporting\n                               audited records. AAI, upon review, noted that INR 65 crores allocated\n                               for debt servicing was unnecessary due to the Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s\n                               loan moratorium and concluded that MIAL had sufficient financial\n                               capacity to meet its obligations.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                          O.M.P.

On 30.03.2020, MIAL&#x27;s Board of Directors unilaterally declared\n                               COVID-19 a Force Majeure event without conducting a financial\n                               impact assessment. On the same day, AAI formally disputed MIAL&#x27;s\n                               Force Majeure claim but, as a goodwill gesture, permitted deferment of\n                               the Monthly Annual Fee payments for April-June 2020, requiring the\n                               deferred amounts to be paid by 15.07.2020. AAI also instructed SBI to\n                               transfer INR 82 crores from the AAI Fee Account to the Surplus\n                               Account to aid MIAL in meeting operational costs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                          8.   On 17.04.2020, MIAL reiterated its position, contending that its\n                               obligation to pay the Annual Fee should be suspended. AAI, in its reply\n                               dated 30.04.2020, refuted this assertion, emphasizing that an obligation\n                               capable of being performed could not be suspended under Chapter XVI\n                               of the OMDA. AAI rejected MIAL&#x27;s interpretation that payment\n                               obligations should remain suspended until pre-pandemic revenue levels\n                               were restored.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">                          9.   MIAL subsequently initiated arbitration against AAI, leading to the\n                               constitution of the learned Arbitral Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as\n                               &#x27;AT&#x27;) on 17.12.2020. Prior to the constitution of the learned AT, on\n                               09.07.2020, MIAL filed a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a> of the Act before the\n                               Delhi High Court, seeking to restrain AAI from accessing funds in the\n                               Escrow Account. The Court, vide order dated 27.11.2020, directed that\n                               38.7% of MIAL&#x27;s revenue be deposited in the Escrow Account but did\n                               not issue any directives regarding past dues. This order was later\n                               modified by the Division Bench on 14.01.2021, requiring MIAL to\n                               maintain INR 153 crores in an interest-bearing account with SBI to\n                               secure AAI&#x27;s claim for unpaid dues.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                          O.M.P.

AAI\n                               filed its Statement of Defence and Counterclaims on 15.06.2021, and\n                               MIAL filed its response to AAI&#x27;s Counterclaims on 05.08.2021.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">                          11.

Learned\n                                   AT disregarded the entirety of this evidence, which forms no part\n                                   of the impugned award.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                              b.   Learned AT has not only rewritten the contract, but has also\n                                   rendered certain contractual provisions ineffective. The impugned\n                                   award nullifies Articles 16.1.1 and 16.1.2(e) of the OMDA by\n                                   removing the requirement of demonstrating ‗inability to perform\n                                   obligations&#x27; to claim the benefit of Force Majeure. Furthermore,\n                                   learned AT has not only failed to examine whether the notice was\n                                   issued in compliance with the provisions of OMDA, but instead\n                                   has altogether deleted the requirement of a notice under Article\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">                                   16.1.5(a) of the OMDA.

The interpretation of the contract contained in the impugned\n                                   Award is not even a possible view of the contractual terms, which\n                                   are explicit, unambiguous and irreconcilable. Learned AT rejected\n                                   the submission of AAI that since AF is calculated as a percentage\n                                   of revenue, it remains proportionate to revenue and is always\n                                   capable of being paid and held that that it would be too simplistic\n                                   to require MIAL to pay 38.7% of its earnings without considering\n                                   its obligation to ensure smooth airport operations. It has been\n                                   stated that the said interpretation of AAI was based on the plain\n                                   and literal reading of <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_10\">16</a> of the OMDA and the\n                                   decision of the learned AT is in the teeth of contractual provisions.\n                                   Further, the learned AT&#x27;s finding that the occurrence of a Force\n                                   Majeure event is indisputable contradicts the express terms of the\n                                   contract and disregards AAI&#x27;s contention that the Covid-19\n                                   pandemic alone does not justify relief for MIAL unless all\n                                   requirements under Chapter XVI are met. While the pandemic\n                                   qualifies as a physical event under Article 16.1.3(vii), it can only\n                                   constitute Force Majeure if it satisfies the conditions set forth in\n                                   Articles 16.1.1 and 16.1.2. MIAL failed to demonstrate its\n                                   inability to perform a specific obligation, a key requirement under\n                                   these provisions. By ignoring these contractual conditions and\n                                   treating the pandemic itself as Force Majeure, the learned AT\n                                   arrived at a conclusion that no fair or reasonable person could\n                                   have reached.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                          O.M.P.

The definition of\n                                   ‗Revenue&#x27; and the language of <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 11</a> is clear and\n                                   unambiguous and provides that payment of AF was not contingent\n                                   on whether MIAL generated profits or incurred losses. The AT\n                                   has erroneously converted the revenue-sharing mechanism\n                                   contemplated under the OMDA into a profit-sharing contract by\n                                   holding that, during the Force Majeure period, revenue receipts\n                                   would first be used for running the airport, and only the surplus, if\n                                   any, would be shared between MIAL and AAI in the contractual\n                                   ratio\n                              e.   The impugned award has rewritten Chapters XVI and XVIII of the\n                                   OMDA by allowing an extension of the OMDA term for a period\n                                   commensurate to 13.03.2020 till 28.02.2022.

Additionally, the Impugned Award provides no rationale for\n                                   excusing rather than suspending MIAL&#x27;s obligation to pay the\n                                   Annual Fee, despite explicitly raising the question in the award\n                                   itself.

Learned AT has granted MIAL relief in excess of what it sought\n                                   in its letter dated 17.03.2020. MIAL only sought suspension of its\n                                   obligation to pay MAF but learned AT granted complete excusal\n                                   from making payment of AF for the period 13.03.2020\n                                   to28.02.2022 and also extended the term of the OMDA by a\n                                   commensurate period. Learned AT failed to address AAI&#x27;s\n                                   objection that suspension or excusal of obligations applied only to\n                                   those arising during the Force Majeure event which MIAL itself\n                                   claimed ended on 11.03.2021, and that only the time for\n                                   performing such obligations can be extended. Article 16.1.5(c)\n                                   does not determine the right to excusal or suspension of\n                                   obligations, which is governed by Articles 16.1.1 to 16.1.3, nor\n                                   does it prescribe what relief can be granted under Chapter XVI. It\n                                   has been stated that Article 16.1.5(c) applies only when\n                                   obligations are suspended--not excused entirely as evident from\n                                   the plain and ordinary meaning of the contract&#x27;s terms, and any\n                                   other view contradicts its clear and unambiguous language.\n                              k.   The allocation of Rs. 6.58 Cr. in costs to MIAL is patently illegal\n                                   and lacks justification under Indian law. The award on interest is\n                                   also unreasoned, patently illegal, and against the fundamental\n                                   policy of Indian law.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">                              l.

It has further been stated in the petition that the Impugned Award\n                              warrants interference on two more counts. First, the learned AT&#x27;s\n                              reliance on AAI granting relief to its own concessionaires to justify\n                              relief for MIAL is patently illegal and has no contractual basis under\n                              the OMDA. It has been stated that the learned AT ignored key evidence\n                              that MIAL itself did not extend revenue share relief to its own\n                              concessionaires at Mumbai Airport. Furthermore, AAI&#x27;s argument that\n                              MIAL&#x27;s claim was not contractual but premised on public law grounds\n                              beyond the jurisdiction was not even considered. The learned AT\n                              erroneously equated MIAL, an airport operator, with small retail\n                              concessionaires (such as cafés) at AAI-run airports, despite the\n                              fundamental difference in their roles. It has been stated that MIAL\n                              holds an exclusive right to operate Mumbai&#x27;s only airport, with its\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                          O.M.P.

Notably, AAI never excused or suspended revenue share\n                              payments for its own concessionaires, making the learned AT&#x27;s\n                              conclusion factually and legally flawed. Additionally, it has been stated\n                              the Impugned      Award&#x27;s reasoning is extra-contractual, relying on\n                              AAI&#x27;s treatment of other agreements rather than the specific terms of\n                              the OMDA, rendering it liable for setting aside under <a href=\"/doc/439304/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 34(2)(A)</a>\n                              of the Act.

MIAL contended that it was not required to demonstrate such\n                              inability to claim the benefit of Chapter XVI--an argument that\n                              directly contradicts the requirement under Article 16.1.1 to demonstrate\n                              an inability to perform the obligation in question. Learned SG\n                              emphasized that when a party has in fact been able to perform its\n                              obligations, it cannot claim an inability to do so or seek an excuse from\n                              performance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">                          26.

It has been submitted that under the\n                              OMDA, MIAL shares 38.7% of its Revenue with AAI, and the said\n                              obligation to pay the Annual Fee is not contingent on MIAL being able\n                              to meet its operational costs or establishing that MIAL is encountering\n                              negative cash flow. It has been submitted that at paragraph 105 of the\n                              Award, the learned AT has converted the revenue-sharing mechanism\n                              contemplated under the OMDA into a profit-sharing contract by\n                              holding that, during the force majeure period, ―the revenue\n                              receipts/collections would have to be used firstly for running the\n                              Airport, and only in the event that there is a surplus thereafter, the\n                              surplus would have to be shared...‖ Learned SG has submitted that this\n                              finding rewrites the OMDA and also has an effect of rewriting the\n                              Priority Cash-flow Application provided in clause 3.2(B) of the Escrow\n                              Account Agreement, wherein payment of AAI Fee is given precedence\n                              over meeting of MIAL&#x27;s operational and other expenditure.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                          O.M.P.

Learned SG submitted that the Impugned Award is unreasoned and\n                              perverse on multiple key issues. At paragraph 31, learned AT stated\n                              that the transpiration of a force majeure event is beyond cavil or\n                              disputation, thereby rendering otiose any notice as envisaged in Article\n                              16.1.5 of the OMDA. It has been submitted that this observation by the\n                              learned AT effectively negates the contractual requirement of\n                              demonstrating an inability to perform obligations before invoking\n                              Force Majeure, thereby bypassing a fundamental prerequisite under the\n                              contract. It has been submitted that the learned AT fails to undertake\n                              any analysis of whether MIAL was actually unable to pay the Annual\n                              Fee which is a critical issue for determining the validity of its claim\n                              under Chapter XVI of the OMDA. Further, it has been submitted that at\n                              paragraph 93, the Tribunal holds that it was unnecessary for it to return\n                              an opinion on the question whether OMDA envisions either revenue\n                              sharing or profit sharing, despite AAI specifically arguing that\n                              acceptance of MIAL&#x27;s claims would fundamentally alter the\n                              contractual framework. Learned SG has submitted that this failure to\n                              engage with AAI&#x27;s argument undermines the reasoning of the Award.\n                              Additionally, it has been submitted that the Award is plainly perverse\n                              and internally contradictory as at paragraph 65, the learned AT\n                              recorded that MIAL conceded that all conditions under Article 16.1.2\n                              must be satisfied in order to claim relief under Chapter XVI, yet at\n                              paragraph 67, it has been stated that MIAL argued that Chapter XVI\n                              does not require proof of inability to pay. Learned SG has submitted\n                              that this contradiction further underscores the perverse nature of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                          O.M.P.

Learned SG has submitted that the impugned award is contrary to the\n                              public policy. It has been submitted that at paragraph 83, the learned\n                              AT held that <a href=\"/doc/124768/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 32</a> of the Indian Contract Act would only be\n                              attracted if the contingency of the outbreak of COVID or any other\n                              closely similar contagion had specifically been postulated and dealt\n                              with in the contract. However, it has been submitted that this statement\n                              disregards the binding effect of Energy Watchdog v. CERC, (2017) 14\n                              SCC 80, which clearly holds that <a href=\"/doc/124768/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 32</a> of the Indian Contract Act\n                              applies when a contract contains a force majeure clause, whereas\n                              <a href=\"/doc/648614/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 56</a> applies when there is no such provision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">                          35. Learned SG has submitted that the fact that MIAL&#x27;s revenues are said\n                              to have dropped during the relevant period is not sufficient to avail the\n                              benefit of Chapter XVI. To avail the benefit of Chapter XVI, all\n                              conditions of Article 16.1.2 have to be satisfied. This is evident from\n                              the plain language of Article 16.1.2 as has also been held in the\n                              Impugned Award. This is also in accord with Article 16.1.3 which\n                              specifies that a physical event (such as the pandemic in the present)\n                              only constitutes ―Force Majeure‖ if it also satisfies the requirements of\n                              Articles 16.1.1 and 16.1.2. Learned SG has submitted that the alleged\n                              temporary negative cash flow of MIAL only satisfies the requirement\n                              of Article 16.1.2(a) but not the requirement of Article 16.1.2(e) and\n                              Article 16.1.1, i.e., the requirement to prove inability.

In view of\n                              the decision of Supreme Court in Energy Watchdog v. CERC, (2017)\n                              14 SCC 80, it has been submitted that a party is not discharged from its\n                              contractual obligations even if performance of the same has become\n                              more onerous. It has been submitted that it is not sufficient for MIAL\n                              to say that if its revenues drop, the provisions of Chapter XVI\n                              automatically trigger. The test is inability or impossibility to perform\n                              the obligation, i.e., inability to pay AAI its share of the Revenue and as\n                              stated previously, it has been submitted that this test is not satisfied,\n                              and, on the contrary, MIAL has in fact discharged its obligation by\n                              keeping aside / paying over AAI&#x27;s share of Revenue while continuing\n                              to operate and maintain the Mumbai Airport. Thus, it has been\n                              submitted that the Impugned Award has substituted the contract\n                              between the parties with one of its own making inter alia by writing\n                              Clauses 16.1.1 and 16.1.2(e) out of existence, in an attempt to provide\n                              some basis for the grant of relief to MIAL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">                          36.

It does not wipe out contractual obligations that arose\n                              for the very first time after the period of force majeure ceased to exist.\n                              It has been submitted that even according to MIAL itself, the force\n                              majeure event ceased on 11.03.2021, thus, no obligation that arose after\n                              11.03.2021 could have been suspended by having recourse to Article\n                              16.1.5(c). Be that as it may, it has been submitted that the learned AT\n                              has erred in not determining what is the ―additional period thereafter as\n                              is necessary to enable the affected Party to achieve the level of activity\n                              prevailing before the event of Force Majeure‖.

It has been\n                              submitted that Article 16.1.5(c) only allows for the time for\n                              performance of an obligation affected by force majeure to be extended\n                              for a specified period within the Term. It does not allow a party to\n                              extend the Term of the Contract itself. It has been submitted that\n                              Article 16.1.5(c) only entails the ―Procedure for Force Majeure‖ and\n                              only defines the period of suspension of performance of an obligation\n                              affected by Force Majeure under Article 16.1.1 and has no application\n                              to the enjoyment of rights granted to MIAL under the OMDA. If it\n                              were the intention of the parties that the force majeure clause would\n                              operate to extend the Term of the OMDA, the contract would have said\n                              as much. It conspicuously does not do so.

It has been submitted that MIAL\n                              purportedly invoked force majeure on 17.03.2020 which was disputed\n                              by AAI vide letter dated 30.03.2020 which was specifically issued\n                              under Article 16.1.5(d) of the OMDA and specifically stated that AAI\n                              did not agree with the assertion of MIAL that no Annual Fee is to be\n                              paid due to suspension of obligations of MIAL on account of Force\n                              Majeure event.

It has been submitted that\n                              Learned AT rightly rejected AAI&#x27;s interpretation, which rendered the\n                              word &quot;excuse&quot; otiose and introduced terms like &quot;deferral&quot; that were not\n                              present in the clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">                          45.

It is an admitted position that\n                              COVID-19 is a force majeure event and that a decrease in ATM and\n                              PTM adversely affected MIAL&#x27;s ability to generate revenue due to the\n                              outbreak of COVID-19 which significantly impacted MIAL&#x27;s\n                              capability to operate the airport, leading to expenses exceeding\n                              receipts.

Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the Learned AT&#x27;s findings on\n                              the interpretation of Articles 16.1.1, 16.1.2, and 16.1.5 of the OMDA\n                              are correct, reasonable, and based on the evidence and material before\n                              it. It has been submitted that COVID-19 was undeniably a force\n                              majeure event, as acknowledged by both AAI and the Government of\n                              India. Moreover, it has been asserted that AAI itself granted relief to its\n                              concessionaires due to COVID-19, which the Learned AT deemed an\n                              admission of the occurrence of a force majeure event. Additionally, it\n                              has been submitted that MIAL&#x27;s financial statements indicated that its\n                              total revenue from airport operations was insufficient to meet its\n                              operational expenses, thereby demonstrating its inability to discharge\n                              its obligations under OMDA. It has been submitted that these financial\n                              statements were neither challenged nor questioned by AAI during\n                              cross-examination and despite the drastic reduction in aircraft and\n                              passenger movement due to various government notifications and\n                              circulars restricting air travel, MIAL was legally obligated to incur all\n                              costs associated with the maintenance and operation of the airport. It\n                              has been submitted that AAI&#x27;s contention that MIAL&#x27;s continued\n                              payment of the Annual Fee negates its claim of ―inability‖ is\n                              misplaced. It has been submitted that these payments were made\n                              pursuant to the Order dated December 22, 2021, which was based on a\n                              Joint Application dated December 13, 2021, explicitly stating that the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">                          O.M.P.

Learned Senior Counsel in respect of the AAI&#x27;s argument that the\n                              Learned AT has rewritten the OMDA and Escrow Agreement has\n                              submitted that the same is misplaced and unfounded. It has been\n                              submitted that the award does not alter the OMDA but rather applies\n                              the force majeure clause as per the contract. Further, it has also been\n                              submitted that AAI&#x27;s submission that relief of extension of the term of\n                              OMDA amounts to rewriting the contract is erroneous as the Learned\n                              AT has rightly relied on Article 16.1.5(c) of the OMDA, which\n                              provides a contractual basis for granting the relief of extension. It has\n                              been submitted that the Learned AT rightly held that the necessary\n                              consequence of a force majeure event was a corresponding extension of\n                              OMDA for such a period as the learned AT recognized the force\n                              majeure conditions to have existed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\">                          49.

It has been submitted that the said email explicitly\n                              recorded AAI&#x27;s acknowledgment that COVID-19 constituted a force\n                              majeure event and deferred the Monthly Annual Fee payments on that\n                              basis. Furthermore, it has been submitted that AAI, having chosen not\n                              to lead a fact witness before the learned AT to explain away its\n                              admission, cannot now dispute the force majeure claim. In light of the\n                              foregoing, Learned Senior Counsel has submitted that the challenge\n                              under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 34</a> is wholly without merit and deserves to be rejected.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                          O.M.P.

It is a settled proposition that the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_53\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n                              1963</a>, as amended up to date, prescribes minimum judicial interference.\n                              The Court can interfere under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 34</a> of the Act on the limited\n                              grounds provided therein. The award can only be interfered with if the\n                              Court reaches to the conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to\n                              the root of the matter and there is no possibility of alternative\n                              interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. It is no longer res\n                              integra that the Court while exercising the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_55\">Section\n                              34</a> cannot clothe itself with an appellate jurisdiction. The Court is\n                              bound to respect the finality of the arbitral award. <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_56\">The Act</a> mandates\n                              party autonomy to get their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum\n                              as provided under the law. The approach of interfering into the award\n                              without there being any ground as prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 34</a> would\n                              actually frustrate the commercial wisdom behind opting for alternate\n                              dispute resolution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73225941\" id=\"span_182\">It is also pertinent to mention here that the Court\n                              cannot interfere into the award merely on the ground that an alternative\n                              view is possible on the facts and interpretations of contract. It is also a\n                              settled proposition that the Court should respect the view taken by the\n                              Arbitral Tribunal even if the reasoning provided in the award is\n                              implied.

The Court is of the considered view that ‗a\n                              force majeure clause&#x27; in a contract is generally an exception or an\n                              eclipse provision, meaning thereby if a force majeure is enforced the\n                              performance as mandated in the other terms of the contract will remain\n                              eclipsed till the force majeure event persists. Whether the force majeure\n                              has taken place or not or it exists or not or the time till when it exists is\n                              a question of fact to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_71\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"149110796\" id=\"span_227\">63.

In the present case, the AAI has challenged the impugned award inter\n                              alia on the ground that learned AT has fallen into error by inter alia\n                              holding that the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic is a force majeure\n                              event and does not even call for consideration. As far as the happening\n                              of the epidemic i.e. COVID-19 is concerned, that cannot be disputed.\n                              The question is whether merely happening of the COVID-19 or anyone\n                              epidemic within India is sufficient to invoke force majeure. In this\n                              regard, learned AT has accepted the reliance of DIAL on various\n                              Central Government notifications, State Government notifications to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">                          O.M.P.

The\n                              contention of the petitioner is that for an event to be force majeure, it\n                              has to fulfill the conditions as being <a href=\"/doc/1010255/\" id=\"a_86\">laid down in</a> Article 16.1.1, 16.1.2\n                              and 16.1.3. It is the contention of AAI that under Article 16.1.1, the\n                              party can only claim &#x27;to suspend&#x27; or &#x27;to excuse&#x27; the obligation only &#x27;to\n                              the extent&#x27; that the party ―is unable to render such performance‖. Thus,\n                              the contention is that there can only be ―suspension‖ or ―excusal‖ to the\n                              extent that the party is unable to render such performance. Further, the\n                              contention of AAI is that the force majeure can only be invoked if there\n                              is a strict compliance of Article 16.1.5. Learned SG has argued\n                              vehemently that since there was no inability on the part of MIAL to pay\n                              the fee, the force majeure event on the face of it could not have been\n                              held to have occurred. It has also been submitted that even as per\n                              Article 16.1.2(e) the events as described in 16.1.2 from to (a) to (d)\n                              should be read alongwith Article 16.1.1. Though it has not been\n                              disputed that as per Article 16.1.3(VII) there was an epidemic within\n                              India. However, it has been submitted that this itself alone is not\n                              sufficient to invoke Chapter-XVI. The another contention is that the\n                              procedure for force majeure as prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/250697/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 16.1</a> has not been\n                              complied with.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                          67.

This court\n                              finds no fault in the learned AT&#x27;s finding that capability of MIAL to\n                              generate revenue was materially and adversely affected starting from\n                              the last week of March 2020. The outbreak of Covid-19 had materially\n                              and adversely affected the airport&#x27;s operational capacity, resulting in\n                              expenses surpassing the receipts. It may also be reiterated even at the\n                              cost of the brevity that there was no option for MIAL to close down the\n                              airport. There is a force in the contention of MIAL that the finding of\n                              learned AT qua ―inability‖ is a finding of fact based on evidence\n                              presented before it and there is no jurisdiction with the Court under\n                              <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 34</a> to interfere into the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">                          73. AAI has taken a plea that since MIAL continued paying actual fee\n                              therefore it cannot be said that it was ―unable to pay‖. However, there\n                              is a force in the contention of MIAL that these payments were made\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                          O.M.P.

It has to be noted that the MIAL\n                              had stated that the said orders were made without prejudice as an\n                              interim arrangement. The question here is not that whether it was made\n                              voluntarily or involuntarily, the question is that whether merely factum\n                              of payment of AF will negate the plea of MIAL that in view of the\n                              reduction in the ATM &amp; PTM, they were unable to pay the fee in\n                              accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 11.</a> MIAL was certainly at the receiving\n                              end, they had to run the operations of the Airport as well as, as a\n                              commercial venture had to fulfill their obligations. The Court does not\n                              find any fault with the finding of the learned AT that merely because\n                              the payment was made, it cannot be held that they were unable to make\n                              payment of the fee.

As it has been discussed in detail herein above that the interpretation of\n                               a contract falls within the domain of Arbitral Tribunal. The\n                               interpretation of contract if it is plausible or even may be possible\n                               cannot be set aside only because there can be alternative interpretation.\n                               The interpretation adopted by an Arbitral Tribunal can be set aside only\n                               if it is perverse. This Court considers that the interpretation adopted by\n                               the learned AT in the present case in this regard cannot be termed to be\n                               perverse.

It\n                                   would be too simplistic a proposition to say that the\n                                   Claimant must pay 38.7 percent of whatever its earnings are\n                                   without taking into consideration the fact that the Claimant\n                                   is obligated to ensure smooth functioning of the Airport in\n                                   entirety without any support from Respondent No.1. In our\n                                   view, a reading of Chapter XVI would show that the\n                                   Claimant was unable to render the operation and\n                                   maintenance of all functions/activities of the Airport with\n                                   whatever revenues it was earning at the relevant time. If the\n                                   receipts and earnings from the operation of the Airport are\n                                   inadequate for maintaining and servicing the Airport, it is\n                                   illogical to nevertheless maintain that the Claimant would\n                                   be liable to pay a percentage of the receipts towards the\n                                   MAF. The Tribunal is of the considered opinion that during\n                                   the force majeure period the revenue receipts/collections\n                                   would have to be used firstly for running the Airport, and in\n                                   the event that there is a surplus thereafter, the surplus\n                                   would have to be shared between the Claimant and\n                                   Respondent in the contractual ratio. This conclusion will\n                                   fulfil the intent and postulation of Chapter XVI. The fact\n                                   that Respondent No.1 had itself waived the dues of its\n                                   concessionaires, justifies repetition. The Claimant has,\n                                   indubitably, been bearing the burden of all the expenses for\n                                   ensuring the smooth running the Airport. If the cumulative\n                                   revenue from the operation of the Airport post parting with\n                                   38.7 percent thereof to Respondent No.1 remains deficient,\n                                   OMDA does not envisage of require the Claimant to make\n                                   up the shortfall from any other sources.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_316\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">                          O.M.P.

The Tribunal must not lose sight of the fact that it is\n                                   seized of a force majeure event during which the Claimant\n                                   had perforce to perform all its obligations as envisaged in\n                                   the OMDA. Indeed, even if the Claimant was desirous of\n                                   terminating the contract/OMDA it could not have done so\n                                   because the Airport services were mandated to continue to\n                                   function       for      handling        permitted       flight\n                                   operations/transportation for essential goods/ medicine, and\n                                   to ensure law and order and emergency services, and hence,\n                                   even though the aircraft and passenger movement had\n                                   drastically reduced, the Claimant was compelled by law to\n                                   incur all costs in the maintenance and operation of the\n                                   Airport. The force majeure doctrine contemplates the\n                                   continuance in contradistinction to the cancellation of a\n                                   contract on the grounds of frustration or impossibility of\n                                   performance (the latter being covered by <a href=\"/doc/648614/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 56</a> of the\n                                   Contract Act), the sine qua non being that neither party (or\n                                   only one of them) should be unduly made to suffer losses.\n                                   The Claimant cannot be heard to complain that it was\n                                   entitled to reasonable profits as in yesteryears; equally the\n                                   Respondent cannot be heard to demand its MAF even\n                                   though this payment would add to the losses being incurred\n                                   in this period by the Claimant. In these circumstances the\n                                   Tribunal concludes that during the continuance of force\n                                   majeure the Claimant is excused/exempted from payment of\n                                   MAF until the time its revenue or receipts or collections had\n                                   exceeded its expenses in maintaining the Airport and\n                                   ensuring its proper operability, as conceived in the\n                                   OMDA.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">                          79.

The first and foremost duty of the\n                              MIAL is to ensure that the airport is duly maintained and serviced.

The purpose of\n                              the force majeure clause in any contract is to ensure that the business\n                              must continue and should not come to an end. The purpose is to\n                              prevent the party from suffering the losses or to mitigate the same.\n                              Learned AT has rightly noted that MIAL cannot be permitted to say\n                              that it is entitled to reasonable profit as previous years and in the same\n                              fashion AAI cannot be allowed to demand its AF even though this\n                              payment would add to the losses being incurred in this period by\n                              MIAL. As stated above, force majeure clause is like an eclipse to the\n                              general clauses i.e., if the force majeure clauses comes into the\n                              existence the general clauses eclipses during that period.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">                          80.

Hypothetically, if the reverse view is taken that is even despite\n                              reduction in the revenue, MIAL is made to pay the fee even out of its\n                              nose, this Court considers that the same would be against the object and\n                              intention of the OMDA. Petitioner has taken a plea that the MIAL vide\n                              its letter dated 11.03.2021 itself has stated that force majeure had\n                              ceased and therefore no relief could have been granted thereafter.

Learned AT\n                              noted that while gross revenue was Rs. 182.09 crores, expenditure\n                              stood at Rs. 191.06 crores. It was also noted that neither party provided\n                              records regarding the date when Covid-19/force majeure ceased to exist\n                              or when MIAL&#x27;s cash flow turned positive. Learned AT took into\n                              account that the Government of India lifted restrictions on aeronautical\n                              and non-aeronautical services in a phased manner starting from\n                              25.05.2020, permitting essential domestic operations in limited\n                              capacity, though international travel remained suspended until\n                              31.03.2021. The learned AT further noted that the second wave of\n                              Covid-19 impacted India in March 2021.

Petitioner has assailed the impugned award on the ground that the\n                              learned AT has re-written the terms of the OMDA and Escrow\n                              agreement by turning the ‗Revenue Sharing Contract&#x27; into ‗Profit\n                              Sharing Contract&#x27;. It has already been discussed herein above that there\n                              was no option for the MIAL but to operate the airport. The contention\n                              of MIAL in this regard is that the learned AT after duly taking into\n                              account the revenue generated during this period and the fact that\n                              expenditure was more than the revenue interpreted Chapter-XVI of the\n                              OMDA and granted relief to MIAL. The Court finds substance in the\n                              contention of the MIAL in this regard and is unable to persuade itself to\n                              agree with the contention of the AAI that the learned AT has re-written\n                              the contract while granting the relief to MIAL.         In regard to the\n                              extension of the term of OMDA, learned AT has relied upon Article\n                              16.1.5(c) of the OMDA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">                          83.

It is a well-known\n                              fact that no one could have predicted the onset of a pandemic like\n                              COVID-19. When the pandemic began in March 2020, its full impact\n                              was not understood by anyone. Initially, people assumed it would last\n                              for a few days, then weeks, and eventually, months. However, as the\n                              pandemic unfolded, it caused severe disruption during the first wave\n                              and returned in 2021 with a second wave, inflicting unimaginable\n                              losses both in terms of human lives and the economy.

It\n                              considers that the learned AT rightly took into account the commercial\n                              realities and extended the contract&#x27;s term appropriately.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">                          88.

This communication occurred when COVID-19 had just\n                              begun, and at that time, the full scope of its impact was unknown. Even\n                              the best scientists and economists were uncertain about the pandemic&#x27;s\n                              long-term effects. The world was in the early stages of trying to\n                              manage the situation, and it was unimaginable that its effects would\n                              last as long as they did. At the time, AAI reasonably assumed that the\n                              impact would be short-lived, likely continuing only until June 2020,\n                              and thus accommodated the MIAL.

The findings of the learned AT\n                              are based on these facts, and the Court does not find any perversity in\n                              them. It is also important to note that just because another view might\n                              have been possible, the Court cannot substitute its own opinion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">                          90.

The entire case revolves\n                              around the interpretation of Article XVI of the OMDA. The question\n                              was that whether the force majeure event had taken place in terms of\n                              Article XVI and further, whether the petitioner can be excused from\n                              paying the AF as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 11</a> for the period till\n                              13.03.2020 to 28.02.2022.

The\n                              plea of the petitioner was the force majeure event had not taken place\n                              and there was no question of excusal of the payment of fee in terms of\n                              the OMDA and furthermore, there was no provision for the extension\n                              of the contract. Per contra, the contention of the respondents was that\n                              the learned AT has granted the relief in terms of the terms of contract.\n                              It is a settled preposition that interpretation of the terms of the contract\n                              falls within the domain of the Arbitrator. The entire dispute in both the\n                              cases revolved around the interpretation of the terms of the contract.\n                              The discussion made hereinabove makes it clear that the learned AT\n                              had passed a speaking order after taking into account the material and\n                              the evidence available on the record. The perusal of the award makes it\n                              clear that it cannot be said that the view taken by the Arbitrator is not a\n                              possible and plausible view. It is also a settled preposition that even if\n                              the alternative view is available, the Court cannot substitute its own.\n                              This Court did not find any material to say that there was perversity in\n                              the award passed by the learned AT.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">                          91.
