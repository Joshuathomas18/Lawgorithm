The further\n\n    request was made for advance of Rs.25,31,796 in October 2000. The\n        \n\n\n    complaint of the respondent was that instead of reimbursing this further\n     \n\n\n\n    amount, the petitioner deducted and/or reversed the earlier reimbursement\n\n    of works contract on 15th October 2001. Therefore, the right to claim this\n\n\n\n\n\n    amounts accrued in October 2000 and in any event from 15th October\n\n    2001. The statement of works contract tax with interest has been annexed\n\n\n\n\n\n    by the respondent. Assuming without admitting the statements, it is clear\n\n    that the alleged due date of the last installment is 1st May 2002.

Further, in any event, the interest could not have been awarded\n\n\n\n\n\n    at 6%. The learned Arbitrator failed to assign any reasons while granting\n\n    16% interest and hence, the award is vitiated.

Mr.Dhanuka then contended\n\n    that the respondents have pointed out in great details that the amount was\n\n    withheld.   It was initially reimbursed but recovery commenced and,\n\n    therefore, the matter went to arbitration.    Once it is found that the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:53 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                                     16</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    amounts have been withheld without any basis, then, the Arbitrator was\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    empowered to award interest. Mr.Dhanuka has invited my attention to\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/114615517/\" id=\"a_11\">section 31(7)(a)</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996. The power under this\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    provision has been rightly exercised. The rate of interest is within the\n\n    exclusive power of the Arbitrator. The rate of interest is considered from\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    October 2002 till the date of the award, rightly, as the petitioners have\n                            \n    illegally deducted the amounts from the bill of respondents. With regard\n\n    to quantum of interest and the manner in which the same has to be paid,\n                           \n    the petitioners cannot make any complaint as it is well within the powers\n\n    of the Arbitrator. Further, the petitioners themselves had charged interest\n        \n\n\n    at 16% p.a. on various advances. Therefore, it is now not permissible for\n     \n\n\n\n    them to dispute the rate determined by the Arbitrator. Thus, on the issue\n\n    of jurisdiction, the limitation and interest the award is not vitiated and\n\n\n\n\n\n    does not deserve to be set aside.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">    24]   As far as the main plank of the submissions of Mr.Bharucha and\n\n    more particularly with regard to work contract tax liability, Mr.Dhanuka\n\n    submits that the argument proceeds on a complete misconception.

Instant contract was treated as on\n\n    going contract by assessing authorities and accordingly, they assessed the\n        \n\n\n    respondent at 1% under the amended provisions of Sales Tax. In view of\n     \n\n\n\n    the demand raised by Sales Tax Authorities for the year 1st April 1998 to\n\n    31st March 1999, respondents were required to pay a sum of Rs.48,89,563\n\n\n\n\n\n    and Rs.7,05,033 towards Taxes under the Contracts Act.

The respondents\n\n    had approached the consultants/ engineers and requested that the amount\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    of Rs.55,95,596 paid by them to the Sales Tax Authorities due to the\n\n    amendment be reimbursed/ released.

On the recommendation of the Engineer, the\n                             \n    employer/ petitioner rightly reimbursed the sum of Rs.1,40,39,813 after\n\n    submission of sales tax assessment till March 2002. After reimbursing\n                            \n    the said amount, a false and frivolous objection appears to have been\n\n    raised and in view thereof, petitioners illegally decided to recover the\n        \n\n\n    amount already reimbursed. This decision was recorded in the Minutes\n     \n\n\n\n    of the Meeting held on 21st October 2003. (Exh.C-16). On the basis of\n\n    this position, petitioners recovered Rs.1,40,39,813/- from the bills of\n\n\n\n\n\n    October 2001, which was delayed for substantial period by the petitioners\n\n    themselves.

The parties proceeded before the Arbitrator on the basis that not only\n                            \n    the extent of the liability but the quantum of the tax are matters which\n\n    can be gone into by the Arbitrator. Thus, this is a matter where the\n                           \n    question of law was specifically referred to the Arbitrator. The Award\n\n    may not be worded or rendered by the Arbitrator like a Judgement of a\n        \n\n\n    Court of Law with elaborate and complete reasoning, however, once the\n     \n\n\n\n    matter has been considered by the Arbitrator, then, merely because the\n\n    Award is erroneous, is no ground to set aside the same.

The contract admittedly\n                           \n    commenced during the further period and execution continued after 30th\n\n    April 1998.

Further, the\n\n\n\n\n\n    concrete which was being used in execution of work from 1st January\n\n    1998 to 30th April 1998 was not attracting tax as the process of making\n\n\n\n\n\n    concrete was specified and the goods used in the said making were\n\n    treated as used in the same form.

For the reasons that were set out by the\n\n    respondent under the heading &quot;Claim No.I&quot;, they prayed that an amount\n        \n\n\n    of Rs.1,68,48,311/- be paid to them.\n</p>     \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">    37]   As against this, the defence of petitioner was that the respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n    have misinterpreted the condition No.8 of the Contract Terms and\n\n    Conditions and have wrongfully raised their claim. The petitioner has\n\n\n\n\n\n    recovered the payment made to the respondent during the Intermediate\n\n    bill stage itself.   The petitioner pointed out that the respondent has\n\n    claimed reimbursement of whole of works contract tax at 1% made\n\n    applicable from 1st May 1998 and not on the increase part of 1% of its\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:53 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                                       36</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    liability. Thus, it appears that the stand is that petitioner should bear the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    entire burden of works contract tax.

In any\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    event, the claim as made is contrary to the terms of the contract. It was\n                            \n    then contended that even if the respondent formed joint venture for the\n\n    contract work only, they are deemed to have worked out their work tax\n                           \n    liability as per applicable law prior to 1st May 1998. They cannot be\n\n    permitted to urge that they were not liable to pay any work contract tax\n        \n\n\n    prior to 1st April 1998. Respondent has not given any details about their\n     \n\n\n\n    cost of works contract tax while bidding and since they have claimed for\n\n    total works contract it implies that they had no intention to take any\n\n\n\n\n\n    benefit under the Addendum No.8 of the Conditions of Contract. In such\n\n    circumstances, the claim is illegal and could not have been awarded.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">    Thereafter and without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, the\n\n    petitioner objected to claim No.1 on various grounds including that no\n\n    proof of payment has been produced.

It was urged that\n\n    the onus is on the respondent.       It may be that the petitioner has\n\n\n\n\n\n    reimbursed certain amount to the respondent but that by itself is not\n\n    decisive.

The\n        \n\n\n    respondent is only entitled to get reimbursement of any increase in\n     \n\n\n\n    respect of any tax on completed items. As far as the issue as to whether\n\n    there is any increase in tax after amendment on 1st May 1998 to the Works\n\n\n\n\n\n    Contract Act is concerned, the Arbitrator proceeded on the admitted basis\n\n    that there is an increase in tax on account of deletion of permissible\n\n\n\n\n\n    deductions from turnover of sales under <a href=\"/doc/1660061/\" id=\"a_22\">section 6(1)(A)</a> of declared\n\n    goods purchased from registered dealers and sold in the same form in\n\n    which they were purchased.

The claimant had in their written\n                           \n          submissions given on 18/7/2006 to explain the statements filed\n\n          estimated that the value of steel used in the execution of works\n        \n\n\n          contract comes to Rs.17,329,554/- and value of Metal Crash\n     \n\n\n\n          Barrier which was procured through the sub-contractor comes\n\n          to Rs.10,82.624/-. The respondent has argued that the WC tax\n\n\n\n\n\n          of 10% on these items which were changed in the form comes\n\n          to Rs.28,15,579 and hence this amount also need to be\n\n\n\n\n\n          deducted from the entitlement calculated. The claimant had\n\n          vehemently contested this argument regarding change in the\n\n          form.

I have also no difficulty in\n                      \n     reaching the conclusion that there is no process akin to\n\n     manufacturing involved in these processes.          I have also\n                     \n     considered the fact that the property passes at the point of\n\n     accretion or approval and there is no change in the form at the\n      \n\n\n     time when the property was passed to the employer.                  I,\n   \n\n\n\n     therefore, reject the respondent&#x27;s plea that as change in form\n\n     was involved in both these items used in the execution, burden\n\n\n\n\n\n     on account of these items as pre-amendment Act should be\n\n     reduced from the calculations made above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">           &quot;20.

Inviting my attention to\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    the unamended and amended provisions, it is contended by Mr.Bharucha\n                            \n    that the petitioner in this case is concerned with steel (which was declared\n\n    goods) that was purchased by the respondent and used in the execution of\n                           \n    the works contract. Steel was declared item and under original <a href=\"/doc/1660061/\" id=\"a_23\">section\n\n    6(1)(A)(a)</a> was included if used in the same form. There are also non\n        \n\n\n    declared goods which were earlier exempted if they are covered by the\n     \n\n\n\n    notification date of 14th January 1984. Mr.Bharucha&#x27;s submission is that\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1660061/\" id=\"a_24\">section 6(1)(A)</a> the tax is on turnover of sales in respect of goods\n\n\n\n\n\n    used during the course of execution of works contract but clause (a)\n\n    excluded from the turnover tax declared goods purchased from the dealer\n\n\n\n\n\n    registered from Bombay Sales Tax Act and sold in the same form in\n\n    which they were purchased or declared goods purchased from a dealer\n\n    registered under Bombay Sales Tax Act and sold without doing anything\n\n    to them which results in any manufacture. Steel is declared goods and,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:53 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                                                       44</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    therefore, steel was purchased and used in the same form in construction\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    of the Expressway, then, it should not be liable to tax in terms of\n\n    provisions stated above. However, if steel was cut or bend or shaped\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    before the same was used in the construction, then, change in the form\n\n    took place and the same would be liable to tax. Similarly, if steel was\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    used in the manufacture of some goods, which were in turn used in the\n                            \n    works contract, then also, the steel would be liable to tax. Mr.Bharucha&#x27;s\n\n    contention is that the Arbitrator has failed to notice this distinction and\n                           \n    has merely gone by the argument canvassed on behalf of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">    He submits that to find out whether there is a change in the form, it is not\n        \n\n\n    necessary to apply the test of marketability. Mr.Bharucha&#x27;s submission is\n     \n\n\n\n    that the judgement of the Division Bench on which respondents have\n\n    proceeded to rely is itself inapplicable. The criteria as noted above has\n\n\n\n\n\n    been not noticed by the Arbitrator. There is no question of confusing the\n\n    change of form with marketability. Steel may undergo a change of form\n\n\n\n\n\n    and yet it would not result in manufacture of any goods which could be\n\n    stated to be marketable. However, it is still to be taxed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">    41]   For appreciating this argument, it must be at the outset observed\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:53 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                                       45</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    that the Award is not liable to be set aside merely because the Arbitral\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    Tribunal has stated the law erroneously.

The Arbitrator has before him details of the BOQ items. He had\n\n    before him the written submissions wherein the explanation has been\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    given with regard to the statement filed on record, the value of steel used\n                            \n    in execution of works contract was quantified so also the value of metal\n\n    crush barriers which were procured for the subject contract. It is on this\n                           \n    basis that the petitioner argues that the works contract tax at 10% on these\n\n    items which changed the form comes to Rs.2815579 and even this\n        \n\n\n    amount should be deducted from the entitlement calculated. Thus, this is\n     \n\n\n\n    a pure and simple case where the entitlement was disputed on the ground\n\n    that the entire sum as claimed by the respondent is not liable to be\n\n\n\n\n\n    reimbursed but there must be some adjustment and deduction therefrom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">    It is while considering that submission and argument that the Arbitrator\n\n\n\n\n\n    has held that in order to conclude that there is a change in form, it is\n\n    necessary to apply the test of marketability as separate and independent\n\n    product. It is in that context that he holds that there is no change in the\n\n    form. The argument of change in form made by the petitioner was\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:53 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                                                                        50</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n    therefore, rejected.

If\n                            \n    the petitioners are contending that the respondents did not work out the\n\n    tax liability as per the statutory provisions, then, inherent in such\n        \n\n\n    submission, is the aspect that there was increase in some tax liability. If\n     \n\n\n\n    there was an increase in the tax liability and the contractual clause\n\n    permits claiming of reimbursement, then, one fails to understand as to\n\n\n\n\n\n    how the petitioner can urge that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction or that\n\n    the dispute was not arbitrable. If the argument is of burden of proof not\n\n\n\n\n\n    being discharged by the respondent, then, implicit in the said argument is\n\n    the fact that there is indeed increase in the tax liability and clause 8 of the\n\n    Addendum would be attracted. It is, therefore, obvious that when the\n\n    petitioners argue that the test applied by the Arbitrator is erroneous, they\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                                                                      51</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n    do not dispute that there was increase in tax. Even otherwise that is\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    apparent from a reading of para 14 to 16 of the Award. Even the issue of\n\n    T.D.S. is based upon the agreed position before the Arbitrator and the\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    finding in para 17, therefore, cannot be held to be perverse.                 The\n\n    Arbitrator has, thus, gone by the agreed position that the quantification of\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    the increase in tax is to be provided by the Contractor/ respondent and the\n                            \n    burden is on him and the issue is essentially factual, then, I do not see\n\n    how the Arbitrator can be faulted for proceeding on these lines. It is\n                           \n    while scrutinising the total claim for reimbursement that the Arbitrator in\n\n    para 18 takes into account the figures and more particularly the BOQ\n        \n\n\n    items. The Arbitrator was conscious of the fact that the petitioner argued\n     \n\n\n\n    that the respondent included reimbursement of WCT liability on account\n\n    additional and extra work done from 1st May 1998 for which separate\n\n\n\n\n\n    rates were agreed and the entire liability of the tax on that amount would\n\n    be on the respondent and to that extent the claim will have to be\n\n\n\n\n\n    modified. The petitioner also disputed the claim regarding items of steel\n\n    and metal crush barrier on account of change in form and, therefore, not\n\n    entitled for exemption, even under the provisions prior to 1st May 1998.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">    Therefore, assuming that all arguments canvassed before me were indeed\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                                                                     52</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    canvassed in the same manner before the Arbitrator, yet, what I find from\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    the record that the Arbitrator has not committed such an error which\n\n    would enable me to interfere with the Award under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_28\">section 34</a> of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                          \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">    46]   The only remaining aspect is whether the Arbitrator applied only\n                           \n    the marketability test and has ignored the change of form test completely.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">    It is not possible to hold that he has only applied marketability test. On\n                          \n    this aspect only para 19 of the Award has been pointed out to me which I\n\n    have already reproduced above. However, the Award must be seen as a\n        \n\n\n    whole. The Award proceeds on the basis that the system of levying tax on\n     \n\n\n\n    the balance amount of turnover after deducting the value of goods which\n\n    were purchased from registered dealer and used in the contract without\n\n\n\n\n\n    changing form has been done away with by the Ordinance/ Amendment\n\n    Act. Therefore, after 1st May 1998 such contractors were liable to pay tax\n\n\n\n\n\n    at 15% on the value of goods utilised in the works contract without\n\n    having any bearing on the source of purchase and without the aspect of\n\n    change of form being considered.       Yet, the argument is that while\n\n    furnishing the explanation to the statements, the respondents have omitted\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                                                                       53</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    to point out that Rs.28,15,579/- ought to have been deducted from the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    entitlement calculated as, according to the petitioner, the test of change of\n\n    form was not satisfied. This part of the entitlement alone appears to be\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    the contested issue. The Arbitrator has in that context observed that in\n\n    order to arrive at a conclusion that there is a change in the form, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    necessary to apply the test of marketability. He emphasised on the fact\n                            \n    that these are all BOQ items which cannot be taken to be marketable by\n\n    themselves. It is in this context that he has observed that the test of\n                           \n    marketability will have to be applied. What I find from the discussion\n\n    and the argument now canvassed before me is that the statements were\n        \n\n\n    given with regard to the entitlement. There was a dispute with regard to\n     \n\n\n\n    part of the amount being reimbursed. Earlier, the entire reimbursement\n\n    came to be granted. Now when part of the entitlement is being disputed,\n\n\n\n\n\n    naturally, the Arbitrator was required to go into the issue and find out as\n\n    to whether items within the BOQ allegedly used in the execution of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    contract involve any change of form or not. From a reading of the Award,\n\n    it does not appear to me that the petitioner had placed before the\n\n    Arbitrator the details of the items, the form in which they were used and\n\n    the reason why they should be omitted from consideration. Once such\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                                                      54</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n    details are not placed, then, the Arbitral Tribunal is right in holding that\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    the entitlement as disputed cannot be kept aside.            The amount as\n\n    calculated needs to be reimbursed. Even while this exercise was being\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    undertaken the Arbitrator has deducted from the entitlement a substantial\n\n    sum as is evident from a reading of para 18 of the Award. In these\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    circumstances, I do not see how any larger issue needs to be gone into\n                            \n    and resolved in this case. This was a matter squarely falling within the\n\n    purview of the Arbitral Tribunal and while interpreting the contractual\n                           \n    terms and considering the relevant statutory provisions, the observations\n\n    aforementioned, have been made. Mr.Dhanuka, therefore, is right in\n        \n\n\n    urging that the Award does not require any interference.\n</p>     \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">    47]   In this view of the matter, the Award cannot be set aside on the\n\n\n\n\n\n    ground that there is an error apparent on the face of law and which is\n\n    wholly unsustainable.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">    48]   Reliance by Mr.Bharucha on the judgement of this Court in the\n\n    case of Matushree Textiles (supra) is misplaced. In that decision, this\n\n    Court was concerned with the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1604980/\" id=\"a_29\">section 61(1)</a> of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                                                     55</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959. The questions framed for determination\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    are in para 1. In para 2, the Division Bench considered the factual aspect\n\n    whether the respondent Matushree Textile was engaged in the business of\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    Dyeing, bleaching and printing of grey fabrics received from customers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">    For this purpose, Matushree Textiles used materials such as colours, dyes\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    and chemicals and these materials are converted into a solution and stored\n                            \n    in a tank. Thereafter, grey fabric is passed through the above solution\n\n    several times, till the requisite colour shade is obtained on the fabric as\n                           \n    per the specifications of the customer. Thereafter, the dyed fabric is\n\n    washed through a water solution to drain away the chemical solution\n        \n\n\n    remaining on the fabrics.       On completion of the job work, the\n     \n\n\n\n    dyed/printed fabrics with the requisite coloured shade are returned to the\n\n    respective customers.    The issue was whether the respondent who\n\n\n\n\n\n    undertook the above job work is a dealer within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n\n    2(1)(d)</a> of the Contract Act. The argument was that colours, dyes and\n\n\n\n\n\n    chemicals are consumed in the process of dyeing, bleaching and,\n\n    therefore, the property of those goods were neither transferred as goods\n\n    nor in other form and hence the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_31\">Contract Act</a> were not\n\n    attracted. The Additional Commissioner did not accept the stand of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                                                                     56</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    textile mill. The matter was carried in Appeal to the Sales Tax Tribunal.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                      \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">    The Tribunal after holding that though there was transfer of property in\n\n    goods, the same is too insignificant to take any cognisance. He further\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    held that the Act is not attracted but a reference application was made by\n\n    the Commissioner and, therefore, the Tribunal referred the question\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    framed for the opinion of this Court.\n</p>                            \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">    49]   Thus, it is while considering that argument and stand of the textile\n                           \n    mill, so also that of the Commissioner of Sales Tax to the contrary that\n\n    the observations relied upon by Mr.Bharucha have been made by the\n        \n\n\n    Division Bench. These observations could not be said to be binding on\n     \n\n\n\n    the Arbitrator in this case. The applicability of the Contract Tax Act was\n\n    in issue. Before the Division Bench, the basic argument raised by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    respondent Textile Mill itself was found to be erroneous inasmuch as the\n\n    relevancy of that argument qua the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_32\">Contract Act</a> was being tested. The\n\n\n\n\n\n    Division Bench held that passing of the property of goods used for dyeing\n\n    is relevant. Once that property of goods used in dyeing has passed to the\n\n    consumer in any form, then under the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_33\">Contract Act</a>, there is a deemed sale\n\n    of these materials and the test of marketability under the Sale of Goods\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                                     57</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    Act or the Bombay Sales Tax Act cannot be imported into the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_34\">Contract\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    Act</a>. By reading this part in isolation one cannot urge that the Arbitrator\n\n    in this case has applied the test of marketability. The Arbitrator was\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    dealing with the issue as to whether there is any change of form in the\n\n    BOQ items. It was nobody&#x27;s argument that the property in these goods\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    has not been passed on. The issue was whether there is any change in the\n                            \n    form. While testing that issue and particularly considering the argument\n\n    that steel being cut and bend for executing the works in this case amounts\n                           \n    to changing its form or not or whether it remains the same as such, that\n\n    the findings in para 19 are rendered. I do not feel that the judgement in\n        \n\n\n    Matoshree Textiles&#x27;s case has been brushed aside or that it being binding,\n     \n\n\n\n    the test applied was completely erroneous and, therefore, the Award must\n\n    be set aside. Apart from the fact that the Award must be seen and read as\n\n\n\n\n\n    a whole.    I am of the opinion that the learned Arbitrator has not\n\n    committed any error of law of the nature enabling this Court to interfere\n\n\n\n\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_35\">section 34</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">    50]   In any event, in Matoshree Textile&#x27;s case this Court was not\n\n    concerned with Section 6(1)(A)(a) of the pre 1998 Act and Section 6(1)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                                                                     58</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    (A) of the post 1998 Act, both of which stipulate the conditions subject to\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    which the turn over of sales of certain declared goods purchased from the\n\n    registered dealer are to be deducted from the taxable turnover of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    Sales/ deemed sales. Both these provisions stipulate that deductions will\n\n    have to be effected from taxable turnover pertaining to such goods which\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    were sold in the same form in which they were purchased or if the goods\n                             \n    are sold without doing anything to them which amounted to or resulted in\n\n    any manufacture. Therefore, the test for imposing the tax under the\n                            \n    Works Contract Act is necessarily different from the test for deduction\n\n    and exclusion of sales turnover under these provisions prior to and post\n        \n\n\n    amendment.      It is in the context of the deductions that the learned\n     \n\n\n\n    Arbitrator made the observations and I do not see as to how they are\n\n    erroneous or vitiated to such an extent as would require this Court to\n\n\n\n\n\n    interfere with the Award. Once, the backdrop in which the observations\n\n    have been made and the findings rendered are seen, then, to my mind the\n\n\n\n\n\n    award does not suffer from infirmity. In any event, merely because\n\n    another view is possible does not mean that this Court should interfere\n\n    with the Award. If what has been held is a possible view, then, the Award\n\n    cannot be set aside, is the settled principle.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                                                     59</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n                                                      \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">    51]   As far as the issue of limitation and jurisdiction is concerned, I do\n\n    not find any infirmity in the Award. The clear case of the respondent was\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    that reimbursement of sales tax amount already paid should be made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">    That claim was rejected. After considerable correspondence, ultimately,\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    the petitioner started reimbursing the amounts paid on works contract tax.\n</p>                            \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">    However, from 1st October 2001, the deduction started and demands for\n\n    refund were made by the respondents in writing. The demand raised by\n                           \n    the respondent is not just refund of the recovery amount but also\n\n    deductions from the bills by way of TDS for subsequent period. There\n        \n\n\n    was time taken when the matter was pending before the Engineer and the\n     \n\n\n\n    Petitioner. In any event, the payment was made under various running\n\n    account bills and it is not by itself decisive for commencement of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    period as suggested by Mr.Bharucha. It is also the final bill and its\n\n    passing which is relevant. Hence, apart from the fact that the issue of\n\n\n\n\n\n    limitation is being raised for the first time before me and there was no\n\n    plea raised before the Arbitrator in that behalf, I am of the view that the\n\n    claim is not barred by limitation. The very dates which have been set out\n\n    in the defence/ written statement of the petitioner, would go to show that\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                                                                      60</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n    the claim was within limitation. It is not the right to claim the amount\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    which was an issue but it was the alleged and erroneous recovery by the\n\n    petitioner from the running bill from October 2001 was the issue. It is in\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    this context that the learned Arbitrator could have proceeded with the\n\n    Reference and made the Award. More so, when the respondent referred\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    the disputes by the letter dated 10th May 2005. In these circumstances, I\n                            \n    am of the view that it was not incumbent upon the Arbitrator to dismiss\n\n    the claim as being time barred.          The decisions relied upon by\n                           \n    Mr.Bharucha set out the settled principles. Assuming that the period\n\n    spent when the dispute was pending before the Engineer cannot be\n        \n\n\n    excluded, yet, in this case, it is clear that the issue of reimbursement was\n     \n\n\n\n    raised right from 1999 by the respondent. Petitioners reimbursed to the\n\n    respondent a sum of Rs.1,40,39,816/- on 5th December 2001.

The pleas in that behalf are, therefore,\n\n    untenable and deserve to be rejected. In this factual scenario, I do not see\n\n\n\n\n\n    any necessity to go into the applicability of the decisions on the point of\n\n    limitation. In any event, their applicability would depend upon the facts\n\n\n\n\n\n    and circumstances of each case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">    52]   Similarly, the issue of jurisdiction of the Arbitrator is too belated to\n\n    be permitted to be raised. It is not as if the petitioners did not reimburse\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                                      62</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n    the amount claimed.      They reimbursed the amount and, thereafter,\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    commenced alleged illegal recovery. The contract provided for resolution\n\n    of disputes by Arbitration.       The contract also covered issue of\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    reimbursement. Once the claim arises out of the contract and pertains to\n\n    the contract and the Arbitrator&#x27;s jurisdiction being very wide as is evident\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    from the phraseology of clause 67.3, then, it is not possible to hold that\n                            \n    the Arbitrator did not have the jurisdiction. Admittedly, the clauses in\n\n    question and more particularly clause 67.3 is an arbitration clause/\n                           \n    agreement between parties and that was never in dispute.                In such\n\n    circumstances, the submission that the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction\n        \n\n\n    should be rejected. Once this view is taken, it is not necessary to refer to\n     \n\n\n\n    the decisions cited and in any event, they relate to what could be said to\n\n    be excepted claims and what could be arbitrable. Before me, it is not the\n\n\n\n\n\n    argument that the words &quot;any decision&quot; appearing in clause 67.3 would\n\n    not include the decision to reject the claim for reimbursement. Rejection\n\n\n\n\n\n    of the claim was a decision taken and, therefore, it was wholly arbitrable.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">    52]   As far as the interest aspect is concerned, it is stated that the\n\n    learned Arbitrator has awarded excessive rate of interest.

What the Arbitrator has done is that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    final bill date has been reckoned by him. It was passed on 28th October\n\n    2002. The learned Arbitrator has noted that the petitioner used to charge\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    interest at the rate of 16% on the advances given to the respondent\n\n    contractor and, therefore, that is the rate which should be taken into\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    account, if the amounts as awarded in favour of the contractor, are\n                            \n    directed to be paid. I do not see how the Award is vitiated on this count\n\n    because of absence of any reasons.       Sufficiency or adequacy of the\n                           \n    reasons is not the ground on which the Award can be set aside. Further,\n\n    the respondents in the reply affidavit have pointed out that the provisions\n        \n\n\n    of <a href=\"/doc/114615517/\" id=\"a_36\">section 31(7)(a)</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 have been applied by the\n     \n\n\n\n    Arbitrator. The said provisions empower the Tribunal to include in the\n\n    sum for which the award is made, the interest at such rate as it deems\n\n\n\n\n\n    reasonable. The discretion has been exercised by the Arbitrator and\n\n    considering that this was the claim of an amount initially reimbursed but\n\n\n\n\n\n    later on illegally deducted from the running bill, I do not see how the\n\n    interest awarded can be said to be excessive. There is substance in the\n\n    contentions of Mr.Dhanuka that the aspect of interest was sought to be\n\n    clarified by the petitioners themselves by applying for clarification before\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 15:24:54 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                                                                       64</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator clarified that he has granted simple interest\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    calculated on annual basis.      That part is also suppressed before me.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">    Further, I do not find that the rate determined is so excessive or\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    unreasonable so as to warrant interference in my limited jurisdiction\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_37\">section 34</a> of the Act.

All\n     \n\n\n\n    these arguments are canvassed across the bar and the Court is called upon\n\n    to take judicial notice of the lending rate prevailing. I am of the view that\n\n\n\n\n\n    merely because such a case has been put forward across the bar is no\n\n    ground to reduce the rate of interest, assuming the Court has any inherent\n\n\n\n\n\n    jurisdiction. The larger issue raised by Mr.Dhanuka that the Court has no\n\n    such inherent jurisdiction and its jurisdiction has been circumscribed by\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_38\">section 34</a> of the Act, therefore, need not be gone into in the peculiar facts\n\n    of the case.
