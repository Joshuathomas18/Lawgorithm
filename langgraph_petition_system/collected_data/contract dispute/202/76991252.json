Jindal Exports Ltd. reported in (2001) 6 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">356. The relevant paras of the said judgment read as under :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      ―31. Prior to the enforcement of the Act, the law of\n      arbitration in this country was substantially contained in\n      three enactments, namely, (1) the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_1\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a>, (2)\n      the <a href=\"/doc/777085/\" id=\"a_2\">Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937</a>, and (3)\n      the <a href=\"/doc/142812771/\" id=\"a_3\">Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act,\n      1961</a>. A party holding a foreign award was required to take\n      recourse to these enactments. The Preamble of the Act makes\n      it abundantly clear that it aims at consolidating and\n      amending Indian laws relating to domestic arbitration,\n      international commercial arbitration and enforcement of\n      foreign arbitral awards. The object of the Act is to minimize\n      supervisory role of the court and to give speedy justice. In\n      this view, the stage of approaching the court for making the\n      award a rule of court as required in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_4\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a>\n      is dispensed with in the present Act. If the argument of the\n      respondent is accepted, one of the objects of the Act will be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">OMP 29/2003                                                    Page 10 of 49</span>\n       frustrated and defeated. Under the old Act, after making\n      award and prior to execution, there was a procedure for\n      filing and making an award a rule of court i.e. a decree. Since\n      the object of the Act is to provide speedy and alternative\n      solution to the dispute, the same procedure cannot be insisted\n      upon under the new Act when it is advisedly eliminated. If\n      separate proceedings are to be taken, one for deciding the\n      enforceability of a foreign award and the other thereafter for\n      execution, it would only contribute to protracting the\n      litigation and adding to the sufferings of a litigant in terms of\n      money, time and energy. Avoiding such difficulties is one of\n      the objects of the Act as can be gathered from the scheme of\n      the Act and particularly looking to the provisions contained\n      in <a href=\"/doc/714093/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 46</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1283214/\" id=\"a_6\">49</a> in relation to enforcement of a foreign\n      award. In para 40 of Thyssen judgment already extracted\n      above, it is stated that as a matter of fact, there is not much\n      difference between the provisions of the 1961 Act and the Act\n      in the matter of enforcement of foreign award. The only\n      difference as found is that while under the Foreign Awards\n      Act a decree follows, under the new Act the foreign award is\n      already stamped as the decree. Thus, in our view, a party\n      holding a foreign award can apply for enforcement of it but\n      the court before taking further effective steps for the\n      execution of the award has to proceed in accordance with\n      <a href=\"/doc/1886363/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 47</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1283214/\" id=\"a_8\">49</a>. In one proceeding there may be different\n      stages. In the first stage the court may have to decide about\n      the enforceability of the award having regard to the\n      requirement of the said provisions. Once the court decides\n      that the foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed to take\n      further effective steps for execution of the same. There arises\n      no question of making foreign award a rule of court/decree\n      again. If the object and purpose can be served in the same\n      proceedings, in our view, there is no need to take two\n      separate proceedings resulting in multiplicity of litigation. It\n      is also clear from the objectives contained in para 4 of the\n      Statement of Objects and Reasons, <a href=\"/doc/1886363/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 47</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1283214/\" id=\"a_10\">49</a> and the\n      scheme of the Act that every final arbitral award is to be\n      enforced as if it were a decree of the court. The submission\n      that the execution petition could not be permitted to convert\n      as an application under <a href=\"/doc/1886363/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 47</a> is technical and is of no\n      consequence in the view we have taken. In our opinion, for\n      enforcement of a foreign award there is no need to take\n      separate proceedings, one for deciding the enforceability of\n      the award to make it a rule of the court or decree and the\n      other to take up execution thereafter. In one proceeding, as\n      already stated above, the court enforcing a foreign award can\n      deal with the entire matter. Even otherwise, this procedure\n      does not prejudice a party in the light of what is stated in\n      para 40 of Thyssen judgment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      32. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_12\">Part II of the Act</a> relates to enforcement of certain foreign\n      awards. Chapter 1 of this Part deals with New York\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">OMP 29/2003                                                       Page 11 of 49</span>\n       Convention awards. <a href=\"/doc/714093/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 46</a> of the Act speaks as to when a\n      foreign award is binding. <a href=\"/doc/1886363/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 47</a> states as to what\n      evidence the party applying for the enforcement of a foreign\n      award should produce before the court. <a href=\"/doc/444899/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 48</a> states as\n      to the conditions for enforcement of foreign awards. As per\n      <a href=\"/doc/1283214/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 49</a>, if the court is satisfied that a foreign award is\n      enforceable under this Chapter, the award shall be deemed to\n      be a decree of that court and that court has to proceed further\n      to execute the foreign award as a decree of that court. If the\n      argument advanced on behalf of the respondent is accepted,\n      the very purpose of the Act in regard to speedy and effective\n      execution of foreign award will be defeated. Thus none of the\n      contentions urged on behalf of the respondent merit\n      acceptance so as to uphold the impugned judgment and\n      order. We have no hesitation or impediment in concluding\n      that the impugned judgment and order cannot be sustained.‖\n\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">14.

Thus, unless the document filed by the party before the\n      Chief Justice of India or his designate is an ―arbitration\n      agreement‖ as defined in Section 7 as explained above,\n      requiring a reference in a mandatory sense, no reference, in\n      my view, can be made to the Arbitral Tribunal. It is, as\n      already stated, indeed implicit -- if an objection is raised by\n      the respondent before the Chief Justice of India or his\n      designate that the so-called arbitration clause is not an\n      arbitration clause at all falling within Section 7 -- that such a\n      question will have to be decided in the proceedings under\n      <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 11</a> of the Act. Therefore the contention raised by the\n      learned counsel for the petitioner that the question -- whether\n      clause 5 of the agreement amounts to an arbitration clause --\n      is to be decided only by the Arbitral Tribunal is liable to be\n      rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78969\" id=\"span_17\">19.

But this decision, in my\n      view, cannot support the plea raised by the petitioner in his\n      rejoinder. Even if the Chief Justice of India or his designate\n      under Section 11(12) is to be treated as an administrative\n      authority, the position is that when the said authority is\n      approached seeking appointment of an arbitrator/arbitrator\n      tribunal under Section 11 and a question is raised that there\n      is, to start with, no arbitration clause at all between the\n      parties, the Chief Justice of India or his designate has to\n      decide the said question.‖</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">OMP 29/2003                                                      Page 16 of 49</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1913246\" id=\"span_19\"><a href=\"/doc/1913246/\" id=\"a_26\">ii)   Jagdish Chander Vs.

If the terms of the agreement clearly indicate an\n      intention on the part of the parties to the agreement to refer\n      their disputes to a private tribunal for adjudication and an\n      willingness to be bound by the decision of such tribunal on\n      such disputes, it is arbitration agreement. While there is no\n      specific form of an arbitration agreement, the words used\n      should disclose a determination and obligation to go to\n      arbitration and not merely contemplate the possibility of\n      going for arbitration. Where there is merely a possibility of\n      the parties agreeing to arbitration in future, as contrasted\n      from an obligation to refer disputes to arbitration, there is no\n      valid and binding arbitration agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">      (ii) Even if the words &#x27;arbitration&#x27; and &#x27;arbitral tribunal (or\n      arbitrator)&#x27; are not used with reference to the process of\n      settlement or with reference to the private tribunal which has\n      to adjudicate upon the disputes, in a clause relating to\n      settlement of disputes, it does not detract from the clause\n      being an arbitration agreement if it has the attributes or\n      elements of an arbitration agreement. They are : (a) The\n      agreement should be in writing. (b) The parties should have\n      agreed to refer any disputes (present or future) between them\n      to the decision of a private tribunal. (c) The private tribunal\n      should be empowered to adjudicate upon the disputes in an\n      impartial manner, giving due opportunity to the parties to put\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">OMP 29/2003                                                      Page 17 of 49</span>\n       forth their case before it. (d) The parties should have agreed\n      that the decision of the Private Tribunal in respect of the\n      disputes will be binding on them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">      (iii) Where the clause provides that in the event of disputes\n      arising between the parties, the disputes shall be referred to\n      Arbitration, it is an arbitration agreement. Where there is a\n      specific and direct expression of intent to have the disputes\n      settled by arbitration, it is not necessary to set out the\n      attributes of an arbitration agreement to make it an\n      arbitration agreement. But where the clause relating to\n      settlement of disputes, contains words which specifically\n      excludes any of the attributes of an arbitration agreement or\n      contains anything that detracts from an arbitration\n      agreement, it will not be an arbitration agreement. For\n      example, where an agreement requires or permits an\n      authority to decide a claim or dispute without hearing, or\n      requires the authority to act in the interests of only one of the\n      parties, or provides that the decision of the Authority will not\n      be final and binding on the parties, or that if either party is\n      not satisfied with the decision of the Authority, he may file a\n      civil suit seeking relief, it cannot be termed as an arbitration\n      agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      (iv) But mere use of the word &#x27;arbitration&#x27; or &#x27;arbitrator&#x27; in a\n      clause will not make it an arbitration agreement, if it requires\n      or contemplates a further or fresh consent of the parties for\n      reference to arbitration. For example, use of words such as\n      &quot;parties can, if they so desire, refer their disputes to\n      arbitration&quot; or &quot;in the event of any dispute, the parties may\n      also agree to refer the same to arbitration&quot; or &quot;if any disputes\n      arise between the parties, they should consider settlement by\n      arbitration&quot; in a clause relating to settlement of disputes,\n      indicate that the clause is not intended to be an arbitration\n      agreement. Similarly, a clause which states that &quot;if the parties\n      so decide, the disputes shall be referred to arbitration&quot; or\n      &quot;any disputes between parties, if they so agree, shall be\n      referred to arbitration&quot; is not an arbitration agreement. Such\n      clauses merely indicate a desire or hope to have the disputes\n      settled by arbitration, or a tentative arrangement to explore\n      arbitration as a mode of settlement if and when a dispute\n      arises. Such clauses require the parties to arrive at a further\n      agreement to go to arbitration, as and when the disputes\n      arise. Any agreement or clause in an agreement requiring or\n      contemplating a further consent or consensus before a\n      reference to arbitration, is not an arbitration agreement, but\n      an agreement to enter into an arbitration agreement in future.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">OMP 29/2003                                                       Page 18 of 49</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1864221\" id=\"span_22\"><a href=\"/doc/1864221/\" id=\"a_27\">iii)   Jagatjit Jaiswal and Anr. v.

On the other hand, Mr. V. K.

A reading of Clause\n      13 would clearly show that it is a unilateral cause because it\n      gives all the right to the sellers i.e. defendants to refer any\n      dispute arising under the Contract through the mechanism of\n      Arbitration in accordance with the Rules and Regulation by\n      instituting the proceedings against the buyers and it does not\n      give any corresponding rights to the buyers i.e. plaintiff in the\n      present case. Such a clause would be hit by <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 28</a> of the\n      Indian Contract Act, 1872, and will not enforceable as has\n      been held by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1766448/\" id=\"a_32\">A.

AVN Tubes Limited and\n      the decision of the Arbitrator of M/s. AVN Tubes Ltd. is to be\n      considered final and binding on both the parties. The Court\n      held that cumulative effect of all the three clauses was that it is\n      unilateral agreement. In case, any one of the clauses alone had\n      been there, that by itself may not have made the agreement\n      unilateral. The Court finally ruled that the said agreement was\n      clearly unilateral and not enforceable in a Court of Law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">              xxxx           xxxx          xxxx           xxxx\n\n       ―15. The basis of the above legal provision is that no man can\n      exclude himself from the protection of Courts by contract. In\n      other words, every citizen has the right to have his legal\n      position determined by the ordinary tribunals, except, subject\n      to contract (a) when there is an arbitration clause which is\n      valid and binding under the law; and (b) when parties to a\n      contract agree as to the jurisdiction to which dispute in respect\n      of the contract shall be discharged. The section renders void\n      those agreements which absolutely restrict a party to a contract\n      from enforcing the rights under that contract in ordinary\n      tribunals. As noticed above, Clause 13 of the agreement\n      between the parties in the case in hand imposes an absolute bar\n      on the buyer of the goods i.e. the plaintiff from enforcing its\n      rights under the contract before ordinary tribunals or through\n      the Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism. In the opinion of\n      this Court, such type of absolute restriction is clearly hit by the\n      provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act besides it being\n      against the public policy. Had it been a case where the\n      restriction imposed by the contract was against the\n      enforcement of the rights of the buyer before the ordinary\n      tribunals but the agreement had provided for selection of one\n      of several ordinary tribunals in which ordinarily a suit would\n      lie, the defendant would have been within its right to enforce\n      such an agreement.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">17.

Mr. Singh next submitted that the impugned Awards were\n\ncontrary to public policy of India as not only the same were passed on a\n\nnotional and not a real loss but they also awarded claims beyond 2% of\n\nvalue of the contract, that means, respondent‟s entitlement. In this\n\ncontext, he referred to and relied upon the case of Usha Beltron Ltd.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">Vs.

According to Mr. Singh, the impugned foreign Awards were\n\nopposed to public policy inasmuch as they were procured by\n\ninducement and were affected by fraud and corruption. Mr. Singh\n\nstated that respondent had mischievously opted for IGPA Rules because\n\nrespondent had complete control over IGPA.                  He stated that\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">OMP 29/2003                                                      Page 23 of 49</span>\n representative of respondent was a Member of Managing Committee of\n\nIGPA.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">22.

Mr. Singh lastly submitted that purported foreign Awards sought\n\nto be executed had not yet become final under the law of the contract\n\nunder which they had been passed. He submitted that in accordance\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/45332/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 26</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1950 (England) it was a\n\ncondition precedent that an award made by an Arbitral Tribunal in\n\nEngland could only be enforced after leave of English Court had been\n\nobtained.

Mr. Kumar relied upon <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\n\n48(1)(a)</a> of Act, 1996 and further pointed out that the applicable\n\ngoverning law in the present case was the English law.

Mr. Kumar next submitted that the Courts in England had upheld\n\nthe validity of clauses wherein one party had been given option to\n\nchoose any forum that means either Court or arbitration.             In this\n\ncontext, Mr. Kumar relied upon the following passage of Russell on\n\nArbitration, Twenty-First Edition which reads as under :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      ―A time charter contained a conditional or optional\n      agreement to refer future disputes to arbitration, with the\n      English courts having jurisdiction if the option was not\n      exercised or the condition not met.

Mr. Kumar also submitted that the constitution of AT was in\n\naccordance with the arbitration clause read with IGPA Rules of arbitration\n\nand appeal. He pointed out that the objection with regard to constitution of\n\nAT had neither been taken in the original objection petition bearing OMP\n\nNo. 203/1998 nor in the other connected OMP bearing No. 204/1998. He\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">OMP 29/2003                                                    Page 26 of 49</span>\n also drew my attention to the correspondence exchanged between the\n\npetitioner, IGPA Secretariat and Arbitrator to show that at no stage the said\n\nobjection was taken at the time of initiation of arbitration proceedings or\n\nsoon thereafter. In fact, according to Mr. Kumar, petitioner had actually\n\nparticipated in its own way in the arbitration proceedings and acquiesced in\n\nthe same. He laid considerable emphasis on the fact that petitioner had filed\n\ntheir written submissions before the A.T. in Award No. 1034.           In this\n\nconnection, Mr. Kumar relied upon the following judgments :-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">i)    Narayan Prasad Lohia Vs.

Mr. Kumar also pointed out that petitioner had not taken any\n\nobjection with regard to appointment of an Arbitrator by IGPA on their\n\nbehalf.

Mr. Kumar submitted that interpretation of Clause 8 of GCC by\n\nAT was correct and legal. He stated that the award of damages was\n\nneither unconscionable nor opposed to public policy. He emphasised\n\nthat on complete reading of Clause 8, it cannot be said that it was\n\nnecessary for the respondent to first purchase the unsupplied cargo and\n\nsuffer damages, than alone claim compensation/damages. Mr. Kumar\n\nfurther submitted that the contention of the petitioner that the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">OMP 29/2003                                                     Page 27 of 49</span>\n respondent was entitled only to 2% commission under the contract was\n\nwrong. He submitted that all correspondence including the contracts\n\nwas on principal to principal basis and the alleged 2% commission was\n\nonly a discount offered by the seller to the buyer as was customary in\n\nthe commodity trade.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">32.    Mr. Kumar submitted that assuming without admitting that\n\ninterpretation of Clause 8 by the A.T. was contrary to the opinion of\n\nthis Court, this Court would not substitute its views for that of the\n\nArbitrator.    In this context, Mr. Kumar relied upon the following\n\njudgments :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">i)     G. Ramachandra Reddy and Co. v.

The relevant portion of Rule\n\n62 reads as under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">         ―RULE 62(1) A foreign arbitration award will be enforced in\n         England whether or not the law governing the arbitration\n         proceedings requires a judgment or order of a court to make\n         the award enforceable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">                (2) If a party obtains a foreign judgment by which a\n         foreign arbitration award is made enforceable, he may\n         enforce that judgment in England in accordance with Rules\n         35, 46, 47 and 49.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                                     COMMENT\n                Clause (1) of the Rule. The enforcement in England of\n         foreign awards, like the enforcement of foreign judgments, is\n         governed by English law. Foreign law regulating the\n         enforcement of awards and in particular the need for\n         obtaining judgments thereon does not apply in England.\n         Hence a foreign award may be enforced in England though it\n         has not been made enforceable by judgment in its country of\n         origin and though the law of that country requires a judgment\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">OMP 29/2003                                                      Page 30 of 49</span>\n        of a court to make the award enforceable. If the English\n       court insisted on a foreign judgment in order to make the\n       award enforceable in England, it would ―not be enforcing the\n       award but the judgment,‖ i.e. the foreign award as such\n       might be deprived of all effect in England. The English\n       technique of enforcing an award applies to all proceedings\n       for enforcement of arbitral awards in England, whether the\n       awards are English or foreign. How the award can be made\n       enforceable under its own law is of no concern to the English\n       court......‖\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">39.

He pointed out that the first\n\nimpugned Award had been rendered on 30th August, 1996, when the\n\nnew <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_51\">English Arbitration Act</a> of 1996 had come into force, that is, on\n\n17th June, 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">40.

Mr. Singh next submitted that non-participation in appointment\n\nof the arbitrator or before the arbitrator did not amount to\n\nwaiver/acquiescence.

Consequently, on a conjoint reading of the relevant provisions of\n\nPart II Chapter I of Act, 1996, I am of the opinion that any challenge to\n\nthe validity of the arbitration clause has to be determined with reference\n\nto the substantive law governing the contract itself.

This\n      can be illustrated by reference to the facts of the present case.\n      The parties here have subjected their agreement to the laws\n      of Japan. The question that will arise is: When a court has to\n      make a final determinative ruling on the validity of the\n      arbitration agreement, under which law is this issue to be\n      tested? This question of choice of law has been conclusively\n      decided by the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/633347/\" id=\"a_58\">National Thermal\n      Power Corpn. v.

The Court of Appeal have\n            redefined this requirement, seeing no lack of mutuality\n            in an agreement between two persons which conferred\n            on one of them alone the right to refer the dispute to\n            arbitration. As Fox L.J. said (in a rent review case):\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">      ―There is a fully bilateral agreement which constitutes a\n      contract to refer. The fact that the option is exercisable by one\n      of the parties only seems to me to be irrelevant. The\n      arrangement suits both parties ... the landlord is protected, if\n      there is no arbitration, by his own assessment of the rent as\n      stated in his notice: and the tenant is protected, if he is\n      dissatisfied with the landlord&#x27;s assessment of the rent, by his\n      right to refer the matter to arbitration.

From the aforesaid, it is apparent that by virtue of IGPA Rules,\n\nIGPA alone had the power to appoint an arbitrator.

Enforcement of an award predicated on the\n      feasibility of Overseas&#x27; returning to work in defiance of these\n      expressions of national policy would therefore allegedly\n      contravene United States public policy.           In equating\n      ‗national&#x27; policy with United States ‗public&#x27; policy, the\n      appellant quite plainly misses the mark. To read the public\n      policy defense as a parochial device protective of national\n      political interests would seriously undermine the\n      Convention&#x27;s utility. This provision was not meant to\n      enshrine the vagaries of international politics under the\n      rubric of ‗public policy.&#x27; Rather, a circumscribed public\n      policy doctrine was contemplated by the Convention&#x27;s\n      framers and every indication is that the United States, in\n      acceding to the Convention, meant to subscribe to this\n      supranational emphasis.

If, therefore, the contract was to\n              be performed at Kanpur it was the respondent&#x27;s duty to\n              buy the goods in Kanpur and rail them to Calcutta on\n              the date of the breach and if it suffered any damage\n              thereby because of the rise in price on the date of the\n              breach as compared to the contract price, it would be\n              entitled to be reimbursed for the loss. Even if the\n              respondent did not actually buy them in the market at\n              Kanpur on the date of breach it would be entitled to\n              damages on proof of the rate for similar canvas\n              prevalent in Kanpur on the date of breach, if that rate\n              was above the contracted rate resulting in loss to it.\n              But the respondent did not make any attempt to prove\n              the rate for similar canvas prevalent in Kanpur on the\n              date of breach. therefore, it would obviously be not\n              entitled to any damages at all, for on this state of the\n              evidence it could not be said that any damage\n              naturally arose in the usual course of things.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"341399\" id=\"span_71\">Learned counsel for the Contractor relied on a judgment of a\n      learned single Judge of this court in <a href=\"/doc/341399/\" id=\"a_71\">Union of India v.\n      Tribhuwan Dass Lalji Patel</a> AIR 1971 Delhi 120 .

In fact, this issue stands determined\n\nby the Supreme Court in the afore-referred judgment inter se parties\n\nwherein the Supreme Court in para 31 held that under the new Act,\n\n1996, the foreign award is already stamped as a decree.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">67.    As far as Mr. Kumar‟s prayer for grant of interest is concerned, I\n\nam of the view that I have no power to award interest as I am only\n\nenforcing a foreign award.         In my opinion, a Court dealing with\n\nenforcement and execution of a foreign award has no power to go\n\nbehind the awards. Accordingly, Mr. Kumar‟s prayer for award of\n\ninterest is rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">68.
