The    learned          senior     counsel\n\ncontended that the Division Bench of Delhi High\n\nCourt after examining the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n\n5</a>    and     in   the    light       of     <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_23\">Section       2(3)</a>    of    the\n\nArbitration            Act,     held        that        <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_24\">Section        2(3)</a>\n\nprotects the existing laws, both common law as\n\nwell       as     statutory          law,       under      which       some\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                  12</span>\n\ndisputes    cannot       be     made     subject        matter   of\n\narbitration.       Further,      it    is    urged       that    the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court has rightly\n\nheld that <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 15</a> read with Sections 5 and 7\n\nof the P.P. Act, confers exclusive jurisdiction\n\non the Estate Officer appointed under Section 3\n\nof the P.P. Act, to deal with the application\n\nthat is filed by the ITPO to evict unauthorised\n\noccupants from the public premises and pay the\n\ndamages as provided under Sections 5 and 7 of\n\nthe P.P. Act respectively. Further, Section 15\n\nof the P.P. Act bars and prohibits any court\n\nfrom entertaining any suit or proceeding for\n\neviction    from    the       premises      etc.    as    provided\n\nunder clauses (a) to (e) of <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 15</a> and that\n\nthe general power of the Court under <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 9</a>\n\nof   the    Code    of     Civil       Procedure,        1908     to\n\nentertain    suit     or       proceedings         is    therefore\n\nousted if a dispute raised by the appellant\n\nfalls in clauses (a) to (e) of Section 15 of\n\nthe P.P. Act. It was further contended that the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court rightly held\n\nthat the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_29\">7</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                13</span>\n\nP.P.

Sections 5 and 7 of the\n\nP.P. Act conferred exclusive jurisdiction upon\n\nthe Estate Officer and makes it very clear that\n\nhe alone has sole and exclusive jurisdiction to\n\ndecide such applications of the ITPO in respect\n\nof the dispute regarding public premises. The\n\nsaid    jurisdiction    conferred          upon    the    Estate\n\nOfficer by the statute cannot be taken away by\n\na contract between the parties by incorporating\n\narbitration    clause     in    the    agreement         or   made\n\nsubject matter of any dispute in relation to\n\nthe public premises which will be in occupation\n\nof     the   licensee     for    reference          before      an\n\narbitrator to arbitrate the same. It cannot be\n\nwaiver of statutory provisions of the P.P. Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"453977\" id=\"span_26\">The contract between the parties must be within\n\nthe legal framework and parties cannot contract\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                  14</span>\n\nout of the statute. Further, it was contended\n\nthat     the        Estate    Officer     having    exclusive\n\njurisdiction is not arbitrable and parties by a\n\ncontract cannot agree to refer the matters in\n\nrespect        of     which     jurisdiction       has    been\n\nconferred upon the Estate Officer. Therefore,\n\nthe arbitrability of claims of the appellant\n\ncovered under Sections 5 and 7 of the P.P. Act,\n\nis excluded. To arrive at the said conclusion,\n\nthe Division Bench of the High Court rightly\n\n<a href=\"/doc/453977/\" id=\"a_30\">placed    reliance       upon</a>    the    Constitution     Bench\n\njudgment of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/453977/\" id=\"a_31\">Ashoka\n\nMarketing       Ltd.</a>     (supra),       wherein    the   legal\n\nquestion that arose was as to whether the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_32\">Rent\n\nControl Act,1995</a>, which is also a <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_33\">Special Act</a>\n\nwill override the provisions of the P.P.

This is a matter of\n      construction of the contract, which\n      involves an objective enquiry into\n      the intentions of the parties.\n      First, there are the express words\n      of the disputes clause. If specific\n      words      such     as      ‘arbitrator’,\n      ‘Arbitral Tribunal’, ‘arbitration’\n      or the formula ‘as an expert and\n      not as an arbitrator’ are used to\n      describe the manner in which the\n      dispute resolver is to act, they\n      are    likely      to    be    persuasive\n      although not always conclusive….\n      Where there is no express wording,\n      the court will refer to certain\n      guidelines. Of these, the most\n      important used to be, whether there\n      was an ‘issue’ between the parties\n      such as the value of an asset on\n      which they had not taken defined\n      positions,      in    which    case   the\n      procedure was held to be expert\n      determination;      or    a   ‘formulated\n      dispute’ between the parties where\n      defined positions had been taken,\n      in which case the procedure was\n      held to be an arbitration. This\n      imprecise concept is still being\n      relied on. It is unsatisfactory\n      because some parties to contract\n      deliberately          choose       expert\n      determination           for       dispute\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                           19</span>\n\n                 resolution.

A    clause     in   the\n      contract cannot be split into two\n      parts so as to consider one part\n      to give rise to difference or\n      dispute and another part relating\n      to    execution      of     work,    its\n      workmanship, etc. It is settled\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                     22</span>\n\n          now that a clause in the contract\n          must be read as a whole. If the\n          construction suggested by the\n          respondent is given effect then\n          the decision of the Public Health\n          Engineer would become final and\n          it is not even necessary to have\n          it made rule of the court under\n          the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_57\">Arbitration Act</a>.

A careful reading\n          of the clause in the contract\n          would give us an indication that\n          the Public Health Engineer is\n          empowered    to    decide   all   the\n          questions     enumerated      therein\n          other    than    any   disputes    or\n          differences     that   have    arisen\n          between the contractor and the\n          Government.
