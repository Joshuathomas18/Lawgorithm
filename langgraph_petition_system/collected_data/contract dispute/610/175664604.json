Bypass to KMC from KMDA.\n                Hence, the reason for the stop-work and the impugned\n                cancellation is a change of policy for administrative\n                convenience simpliciter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                                 xxx           xxx            xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                18. In the present case, the impugned cancellation of 07.02.2023\n                cannot be described as a bolt from the blue since the petitioner\n                was put on notice of the impending change in circumstance on\n                24.01.2023 where the reason for the change was also conveyed\n                to the petitioner. The order dated 01.12.2022 of the Urban\n                Development and Municipal Affairs Department stating that the\n                maintenance of the E.M. Bypass would be handed over from the\n                KMDA to KMC provides the rationale for the impugned\n                cancellation. Seen in this backdrop, it cannot be said that the\n                impugned letter of cancellation of the tender /work was issued\n                with an ulterior motive or for extraneous considerations. In fact,\n                the letter of cancellation provides further reasons, namely, that\n                the tender has been found to be non-specific and having\n                technical faults. This would also be borne out from clauses 10\n                and 14 of the Special Terms and Conditions of the tender\n                document which give rise to conflicting interpretations on the\n                placement of the signboards. Hence, besides the administrative\n                decision to hand over the maintenance of E.M. Bypass from\n                KMDA to KMC, the respondent KMDA as the tendering\n                authority, has a right to rectify the ambiguities in the bid\n                document by cancelling the same.”\n                                                     (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                                Page 8 of 83</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\f   (ii)   Secondly, the appellant could not have redressed his grievances by\n\n          invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n          Constitution, as there was no failure of any statutory duty or public law\n\n          element involved. Moreover, since the relief sought was essentially in\n\n          the nature of specific performance, it could have been prayed for only\n\n          under ordinary civil law and not by way of a writ petition.

It is well settled that a contractual dispute with a public\n                law element would be amenable to writ jurisdiction. The present\n                dispute however arises out of a private contract for maintenance\n                of underpasses in the E.M. Bypass and advertisement rights over\n                certain spaces within the contracted area. The rights following\n                out of the contract are purely private in nature and there is\n                nothing to show that the performance of the contract or the\n                consequence therefrom would affect the public at large or even\n                a sizeable section of the public. A public law element is generally\n                understood to mean the reach of an obligation to a large section\n                of the public or the obligation affecting the lives and livelihood\n                of the general public by its very nature. M.P. Power sounded a\n                cautionary note in such cases where the State cites monetary\n                gains or losses as reason for termination of a contract. This is\n                also not&#x27; the case at hand since the reasons given for\n                cancellation were on a wholly different plane.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                21. The above reasons persuade this Court to hold that the\n                remedy available to the petitioner is in the realm of private law\n                and not under Article· 226 of the Constitution which\n                contemplates certain tests including that the dispute must have\n                a public law element. The complaint of the petitioner is\n                essentially for the specific performance of the contractual\n                obligation of the respondent KMDA. Doubtless, the petitioner\n                can avail of appropriate civil remedies for redress which would\n                include damages for breach of the contractual terms.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">                                                       (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                                Page 9 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">\f16.

He further submitted, that the decision to cancel the tender was bona fide and\n\n      had to be taken considering the technical faults in the same. He submitted, that\n\n      there was ambiguity in the tender as regards whether it was lawful to put up\n\n      advertisements at the places outside the underpasses, due to which, many\n\n      interested bidders might not have participated in the tender.

Over the years, the scope of judicial review and the extent to which a Court\n\n      can interfere in disputes arising out of contracts or tenders has seen a\n\n      significant development, marked by a nuanced understanding of the critical\n\n      role of administrative discretion. The judicial quest in administrative matters\n\n      has always been to find a right balance between i) allowing leeway to the\n\n      States in deciding the exercise of their administrative discretion in matters\n\n      pertaining to policy and ii) the need to ensure fairness and propriety in such\n\n      administrative actions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_25\">35. Earlier, the position of law was that any dispute arising out of a contract\n\n      entered into with the State or its instrumentalities could not be adjudicated by\n\n      the court under its writ jurisdiction, as in all such cases, it could be said that\n\n      the ‘real grievance’ was essentially only one being that of breach of a contract\n\n      for which the appropriate remedy would be an ordinary suit and not a writ\n\n      petition. One of the earliest judicial pronouncements in this regard is the\n\n      decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_5\">Radhakrishna Agarwal &amp; Ors. v.

Such reluctance on the part of the courts stemmed from its understanding that\n\n    State or any of its instrumentalities must have the flexibility or the discretion\n\n    to take decisions that are in the best interest of the public and efficient\n\n    governance. Government being the decision-maker of the State is said to be\n\n    the best judge of when a contract or an agreement is in its interest and by its\n\n    extension in the interest of the public, and as such the courts should not\n\n    interfere in the State’s discretion to award or terminate contracts. One another\n\n    reason why contractual disputes were precluded from being espoused under\n\n    the writ jurisdiction of the courts was due to the summary nature of such\n\n    proceedings, which do not allow for an exhaustive review unlike civil suits.\n\n    [See: <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_17\">Radhakrishna Agarwal</a> (supra) at para 11]</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158274660\" id=\"span_35\">41. This simplistic approach of the courts in deeming every act and action of the\n\n    State which was complained of as nothing more than a ‘contractual dispute’\n\n    or a case of ‘breach of contract’ often led to the State abusing its position and\n\n    acting unfairly under the misconceived notion, that all its actions such as\n\n    award of contracts or tenders were nothing but a ‘largess’ – a generosity\n\n    bestowed upon its citizens, which it can at its own whims choose to deny, alter,\n\n    modify, or take away without any consequences.

Terming all\n         actions of government, ranging from social security benefits, jobs,\n         occupational licenses, contracts and use of public resources – as\n         government largesse results in doctrinal misconceptions. The reason is\n         that this conflates the State’s power with duty. The Constitution\n         recognises the pursuit of the well-being of citizens as a desirable goal.\n         In doing this the Constitution entrusts the State with a duty to ensure\n         the well-being of citizens. Government actions aimed at ensuring the\n         well-being of citizens cannot be perceived through the lens of a\n         ‘largess’. The use of such terminology belittles the sanctity of the social\n         contract that the ‘people of India’ entered into with the State to protect\n         and safeguard their interests.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                                xxx         xxx            xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">         13.

Over a period of time the courts recognized the crucial role of judicial\n\n      oversight in preventing the abuse of power and maintaining public confidence\n\n      in the administrative process. Courts developed various doctrines and\n\n      principles to guide their review, such as the principles of natural justice,\n\n      reasonableness and proportionality. These principles ensured that the\n\n      administrative actions are not arbitrary, discriminatory or capricious. By\n\n      enforcing such standards, the courts also ensured that the rule of law was\n\n      maintained and the individual rights were protected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                             Page 25 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\f44.

This ongoing dialogue between the courts and the executive\n\n    branch contributed to the development of a more accountable and transparent\n\n    administrative framework, paving the way for the exercise of judicial review\n\n    even in the realm of contractual disputes to achieve a fine balance between\n\n    efficiency and fairness in policy decisions on the one hand and the rights of\n\n    individuals and overall public interest on the other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">45. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1238017\" id=\"span_40\">In <a href=\"/doc/1238017/\" id=\"a_21\">Mahabir Auto Stores &amp; Ors. v.

There is an obvious difference in the contracts between private\n         parties and contracts to which the State is a party. Private parties are\n         concerned only with their personal interest whereas the State while\n         exercising its powers and discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as\n         is expected of it, for public good and in public interest. The impact of\n         every State action is also on public interest. This factor alone is\n         sufficient to import at least the minimal requirements of public law\n         obligations and impress with this character the contracts made by the\n         State or its instrumentality.

It is really the nature of its personality as State which is\n         significant and must characterize all its actions, in whatever field, and\n         not the nature of function, contractual or otherwise, which is decisive of\n         the nature of scrutiny permitted for examining the validity of its act. The\n         requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 14</a> being the duty to act fairly, justly and\n         reasonably, there is nothing which militates against the concept of\n         requiring the State always to so act, even in contractual matters.

State authorities, like\n\n    private individuals, have a consensual element in contract formation.

Thus, the demarcation between a private law element and public law element\n\n    in the context of contractual disputes if any, may be assessed by ascertaining\n\n    whether the dispute or the controversy pertains to the consensual aspect of the\n\n    contract or tender in question or not. Judicial review is permissible to prevent\n\n    arbitrariness of public authorities and to ensure that they do not exceed or\n\n    abuse their powers in contractual transactions and requires overseeing the\n\n    administrative power of public authorities to award or cancel contracts or any\n\n    of its stipulations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">59. Therefore, what can be culled out from the above is that although disputes\n\n    arising purely out of contracts are not amenable to writ jurisdiction yet keeping\n\n    in mind the obligation of the State to act fairly and not arbitrarily or\n\n    capriciously, it is now well settled that when contractual power is being used\n\n    for public purpose, it is certainly amenable to judicial review.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                           Page 45 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">\f60. Now coming to the facts of the case at hand, the appellant has challenged the\n\n    cancellation of the tender at the instance of the respondent on the ground of\n\n    being manifestly arbitrary and influenced by extraneous considerations. It is\n\n    evident from the notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023, that the tender was\n\n    not terminated pursuant to any terms of the contract subsisting between the\n\n    parties, rather, the respondent ‘cancelled’ the tender saying that there was\n\n    technical fault in the tender that was floated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">61. Thus, the respondent could be said to have exercised powers in its executive\n\n    capacity as the action to cancel the tender falls outside the purview of the terms\n\n    of the contract. Hence, it cannot be said that the present matter is purely a\n\n    contractual dispute. It is also not a breach of contract, as no such breach has\n\n    been imputed to the appellant in terms of the contract, but rather a plain and\n\n    simple exercise of the executive powers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_112\">62. Thus, the present dispute even if related to a tender, cannot be termed as a pure\n\n    contractual dispute, as the dispute involves a public law element. Although\n\n    there is no discharge of a public function by the respondent towards the\n\n    appellant yet there is a right to public law action vested in him against the\n\n    respondent in terms of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. This is because the\n\n    exercise of the executive power by it in the contractual domain i.e., the\n\n    cancelling of the tender carries a corresponding public duty to act in a\n\n    reasonable and rationale manner.

The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than\n\n    precisely stated or defined. The question, whether an impugned action is\n\n    arbitrary or not, is ultimately to be answered on the facts and in the\n\n    circumstances of a given case. An obvious test to apply is to see whether there\n\n    is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned act and if so, does it\n\n    satisfy the test of reasonableness. Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act\n\n    and there is no impediment in following that procedure, the performance of\n\n    the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose any discernible\n\n    principle which is reasonable, may itself attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every\n\n    State action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed\n\n    by reason, is arbitrary. Rule of law contemplates governance by laws and not\n\n    by humour, whims or caprices of the men to whom the governance is entrusted\n\n    for the time being. It is trite that be you ever so high, the laws are above you.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                                 Page 48 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">\f66. Control of administrative discretion is an important concern in the\n\n    development of Rule of Law. According to Wade and Forsyth, the Rule of\n\n    Law has four meanings, and one of them is that “government should be\n\n    conducted within a framework of recognized rules and principles which\n\n    restrict discretionary power”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">67. To enthuse efficiency in administration, a balance between accountability and\n\n    autonomy of action should be carefully maintained. Overemphasis on either\n\n    would impinge upon public efficiency. But undermining the accountability\n\n    would give immunity or carte blanche power to act as it pleases with the public\n\n    at whim or vagary. Whether the public authority acted bona fide would be\n\n    gauged from the impugned action and attending circumstances. The authority\n\n    should justify the action assailed on the touchstone of justness, fairness and\n\n    reasonableness. Test of reasonableness is more strict. The public authorities\n\n    should be duty conscious rather than power charged. Its actions and decisions\n\n    which touch the common man have to be tested on the touchstone of fairness\n\n    and justice. That which is not fair and just is unreasonable. And what is\n\n    unreasonable is arbitrary. An arbitrary action is ultra vires.

The dictum as laid in <a href=\"/doc/884513/\" id=\"a_101\">Tata Cellular v. UOI</a> reported in (1994) 6 SCC 651 is\n\n    that the judicial power of review is exercised to rein in any unbridled\n\n    executive functioning. It was observed that the restraint has two contemporary\n\n    manifestations viz. one is the ambit of judicial intervention and the other\n\n    covers the scope of the court’s ability to quash an administrative decision on\n\n    its merits. These restraints bear the hallmarks of judicial control over\n\n    administrative action. It was held that the principle of judicial review is\n\n    concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in support of which\n\n    the application for judicial review is made, but the decision-making process\n\n    itself. It was held that the principle of judicial review would apply to the\n\n    exercise of contractual powers by the Government bodies in order to prevent\n\n    arbitrariness or favouritism. It was held that the duty of the court is to confine\n\n    itself to the question of legality and its concern should be whether a decision-\n\n    making authority exceeded its powers; whether it committed an error of law\n\n    or committed a breach of the rules of natural justice or reached a decision\n\n    which no reasonable tribunal would have reached or, abused its powers. The\n\n    grounds upon which an administrative action can be subjected to judicial\n\n    review are classified as illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. In\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                           Page 50 of 83</span>\n\f    that very decision, while deducing the principles from various cases referred,\n\n    it was held that the modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative\n\n    action; that the Court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the\n\n    manner in which the decision was made; that the court does not have the\n\n    expertise to correct the administrative decision and if a review of the\n\n    administrative decision is permitted, it will be substituting its own decision,\n\n    without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible; that the terms of\n\n    the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the\n\n    invitation to tender is in the realm of contract; and, that the government must\n\n    have freedom of contract, i.e. a free-play in the joints is a necessary\n\n    concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative\n\n    sphere or quasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must not only\n\n    be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness, but\n\n    must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala fides.\n\n    Moreover, quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on\n\n    the administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">69. To ascertain whether an act is arbitrary or not, the court must carefully attend\n\n    to the facts and the circumstances of the case. It should find out whether the\n\n    impugned decision is based on any principle. If not, it may unerringly point to\n\n    arbitrariness. If the act betrays caprice or the mere exhibition of the whim of\n\n    the authority it would sufficiently bear the insignia of arbitrariness. In this\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                         Page 51 of 83</span>\n\f    regard supporting an order with a rationale which in the circumstances is\n\n    found to be reasonable will go a long way to repel a challenge to State action.\n\n    No doubt the reasons need not in every case be part of the order as such. If\n\n    there is absence of good faith and the action is actuated with an oblique\n\n    motive, it could be characterised as being arbitrary.

One another way, to assess whether an action complained of could be termed\n\n    as arbitrary is by way of scrutinizing the reasons that have been assigned to\n\n    such an action. It involves overseeing whether the reasons which have been\n\n    cited if at all genuinely formed part of the decision-making process or whether\n\n    they are merely a ruse. All decisions that are taken must earnestly be in lieu of\n\n    the reasons and considerations that have been assigned to it. The Court must\n\n    be mindful of the fact that it is not supposed to delve into every minute details\n\n    of the reasoning assigned, it need not to go into a detailed exercise of assessing\n\n    the pros and cons of the reasons itself, but should only see whether the reasons\n\n    were earnest, genuine and had a rationale with the ultimate decision. What is\n\n    under scrutiny in judicial review of an action is the decision-making process\n\n    and whether there is any element of arbitrariness or mala fide.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">71.

The argument of the respondent is two-fold: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">       (i)      First, that the tender had to be cancelled as there was a technical fault.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">                The tender was found to be ‘non-specific’ &amp; ‘not well defined’ as a\n\n                result it created ambiguity resulting in financial losses to the\n\n                respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                               Page 53 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">\f    (ii)   Secondly, the cancellation was also on account of a change in policy\n\n           whereby, the operation &amp; maintenance of the concerned underpasses\n\n           had been handed over to another authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_130\">74. The primary thrust of the respondent’s contention is that the decision to cancel\n\n    the tender was taken in view of the technical faults in the same, more\n\n    particularly the ambiguity as to whether the advertisement boards could be put\n\n    up beyond the area of the concerned underpasses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">75. The learned Single Judge of the High Court in its order dated 24.04.2023\n\n    observed that there was an ambiguity in the Special Terms &amp; Conditions of\n\n    the Memorandum of Tender more particularly clauses 10 and 14 respectively\n\n    which gave rise to a conflicting interpretation as to the placement of the\n\n    signboards. This in the opinion of the High Court was a technical fault, which\n\n    the respondent sought to rectify by way of cancelling the tender. The relevant\n\n    observations read as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">           “18. [...] In fact, the letter of cancellation provides further reasons,\n           namely, that the tender has been found to be non-specific and having\n           technical faults. This would also be borne out from clauses 10 and 14\n           of the Special Terms and Conditions of the tender document which give\n           rise to conflicting interpretations on the placement of the signboards.\n           Hence, besides the administrative decision to hand over the\n           maintenance of E.M. Bypass from KMDA to KMC, the respondent\n           KMDA as the tendering authority, has a right to rectify the ambiguities\n           in the bid document by cancelling the same.”\n                                                    (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">76. However, interestingly, the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023 that came\n\n    to be issued by the respondent makes no mention of any such lacuna. In fact,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                             Page 54 of 83</span>\n\f      there is no reference to the aforementioned clauses or any conflict in their\n\n      interpretation. The aforesaid notice only states that the tender was found to be\n\n      ‘non-specific’ and ‘not well defined’ which created ambiguity due to which\n\n      the respondent is incurring losses, and nothing is stated either about the\n\n      ambiguity in putting up the advertisement boards or for that matter which\n\n      aspect of the tender is non-specific.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">77. It is also apposite to mention that just a month prior to cancelling the tender,\n\n      the respondent on 24.01.2023 issued a notice to the appellant, asking him to\n\n      stop all work in respect of the tender. Remarkably, in the said notice, there is\n\n      no whisper about there being any of the aforementioned technical faults in the\n\n      tender floated by the respondent. In fact, a close reading of the aforesaid notice\n\n      would reveal that the orders to stop the work had been issued for an altogether\n\n      different reason – i.e., handing over of the operation &amp; maintenance of the\n\n      concerned underpasses to another authority i.e., KMC.\n\n\n a.     Scrutiny of Internal File-Notings and Deliberations of the State.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_136\">78. The appellant has in particular placed reliance on various notings made in the\n\n      internal file of the respondent in respect of the tender to contend that the\n\n      cancellation of the same was arbitrary and influenced by extraneous\n\n      considerations. The respondent on the other hand submitted that the internal\n\n      file-notings cannot be used or relied upon to impute any ill-motives to the\n\n      decision of cancelling the tender as they only reflect the opinion of a particular\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                             Page 55 of 83</span>\n\f    individual and cannot be construed or interpreted as the decision of the\n\n    respondent.

We have gone through the internal file-notings of the respondent on the\n\n    aforesaid tender wherein the entire internal deliberations of the KMDA\n\n    officials as to the tender for work have been recorded. In the entire records –\n\n    right from the time the Notice Inviting Tender was being formulated till the\n\n    issuance of the final Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023, there is no\n\n    whisper of any particular clauses of the tender that was floated nor of any\n\n    conflict or technical fault in the same, as claimed by the respondent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">91. We are in seisin of the fact that although the internal-file notings mention\n\n    about the policy change in the operation and maintenance of the concerned\n\n    underpasses, yet a careful reading of the same reveals that the cancellation of\n\n    the tender for work was neither due to any technical fault nor due to the policy\n\n    change in the operation and maintenance of the concerned underpasses but\n\n    was for altogether a different reason.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">92. As per Note #91 dated 30.12.2022 of the file-notings, when the Order dated\n\n    01.12.2022 of the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department\n\n    came to be passed whereby the maintenance was handed over to KMC, it was\n\n    the Minister-In-Charge as the Chairperson of the respondent authority – who\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                         Page 63 of 83</span>\n\f    suggested that in view of the change in scenario the tender be cancelled. In the\n\n    aforesaid note, the following has been recorded - “Recently maintenance of\n\n    EM Bye pass has been handed over to KMC. Thus, in this changed scenario\n\n    we may cancel the work order”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">93. The words “may cancel the work order” clearly indicate, that the respondent\n\n    at that stage by no means was of the opinion that the tender was required to be\n\n    cancelled, as no specific reasons had been assigned as to what effect the policy\n\n    change had impacted the feasibility or practicality of the tender. This is\n\n    especially because, none of the officials of the respondent suggested that the\n\n    tender be cancelled, rather it was the concerned minister who did so.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">94. In Note #95 dated 10.01.2023 it has been clearly recorded by the officials of\n\n    the respondent that it was the competent authority of the KMDA that\n\n    instructed to cancel the tender in view of the aforesaid change in the policy.\n\n    However, since the officials of the respondent were in doubt regarding the\n\n    legality of such action, it insisted on first obtaining the advice or opinion from\n\n    its legal cell before proceeding further. Furthermore, the aforesaid note clearly\n\n    indicates that the work stop order had to be issued only with a view to comply\n\n    with the instructions of the competent authority while it decided upon the\n\n    aspect of cancellation of the tender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                           Page 64 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_164\">\f95. In Note #97, the respondent has recorded the following – “There is no different\n\n    opinion than to get this cancelled, once this has been decided by the Authority\n\n    but a legal opinion may be sought for avoiding further litigations”. This also\n\n    clearly indicates that as the competent authority had decided that the tender be\n\n    cancelled, the officials of the respondent had no other choice but to cancel the\n\n    tender. However, the respondent continued insisting on first obtaining the\n\n    opinion from its legal cell before cancelling the same.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">96. However, thereafter, as per Note #108 dated 24.01.2023 it is apparent that the\n\n    concerned minister during his visit specifically instructed the officials of the\n\n    respondent to cancel the tender. Pursuant to which, the respondent as per Note\n\n    #109 dated 02.02.2023 immediately convened a meeting to undertake the\n\n    steps for cancellation even though the advice from the legal cell had yet to be\n\n    obtained. It thereafter prepared a proposal for cancellation, which culminated\n\n    into the ultimate notice of cancellation dated 07.02.2023.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">97. From the above narrated sequence of events, it is evident that it was none other\n\n    but the concerned minister who suggested to cancel the tender. The respondent\n\n    was reluctant to immediately cancel the tender for work and continued to insist\n\n    on obtaining the opinion from its legal cell. Even though the opinion of the\n\n    legal cell was yet to be obtained, the respondent, despite its initial reluctance,\n\n    undertook immediate steps to cancel the tender after the concerned minister\n\n    personally instructed the officials to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                           Page 65 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">\f98. Thus, it is evident that the Notice of Cancellation dated 07.02.2023, issued to\n\n    the appellant, was at the behest of the concerned minister. The respondent\n\n    clearly recorded that, because instructions for cancellation had been received\n\n    from the higher-ups, there was no option but to proceed with the cancellation.\n\n    Even before the respondent could properly and thoroughly explore the\n\n    possibility of acceding to such request by consulting its legal cell, the tender\n\n    was cancelled only at the instance and specific instructions of the concerned\n\n    minister.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">99. The aforesaid aspect can be looked at from one another angle. The concerned\n\n    Minister-In-Charge had instructed to cancel the tender in view of the change\n\n    in policy whereby the operation &amp; maintenance of the underpasses was vested\n\n    in another authority. To ascertain whether the decision of the concerned\n\n    minister to cancel the tender was arbitrary or not, we must first consider\n\n    whether the reason for such cancellation was genuinely on the basis of the\n\n    aforesaid change in policy or whether it was driven by some personal\n\n    discretion or motives. This can be discerned by first understanding the change\n\n    in policy that took place.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">100. The Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department by way of its\n\n    Order dated 01.12.2022 decided that the maintenance of the roads and\n\n    drainage of the E.M. Bypass shall be handed over by the respondent to the\n\n    KMC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_173\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                         Page 66 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\">\f101. As per the Note #91 dated 30.12.2022, the concerned minister for the first time\n\n    proposed cancellation of the tender in view of the aforesaid change in scenario\n\n    as a result of the maintenance of the E.M. Bypass being handed over from the\n\n    respondent to the KMC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">102. However, it is pertinent to note that in the aforesaid order of the Urban\n\n    Development and Municipal Affairs Department it has been specifically stated\n\n    that the right to collect revenue from the advertisements as-well as the control\n\n    of the E.M. Bypass shall continue to remain with the respondent herein.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">103. Thus, the respondent at the relevant point of time was not only in control of\n\n    the two underpasses, but was also empowered to continue collecting revenue\n\n    from the advertisements displayed at the underpasses. As such the respondent\n\n    even after the change in policy, remained well within its rights to continue\n\n    charging license fee in lieu of the advertisement rights by way of the aforesaid\n\n    tender that was issued to the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_178\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_179\">104. When the respondent issued the work stop orders to the appellant on\n\n    24.01.2023 in view of the handing over of the maintenance of the E.M. Bypass\n\n    to the KMC, the appellant in response, pointed out that the work stop orders\n\n    were completely misconceived as the respondent continued to retain the\n\n    custody as-well as the advertisement rights of the concerned underpasses.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                         Page 67 of 83</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_180\">\f105. It was only after the appellant highlighted why the work stop orders were\n\n    misconceived and uncalled for, that the respondent immediately flipped its\n\n    stance and in its notice of cancellation that was issued just 1-month later, it\n\n    attributed ‘technical faults’ in the tender floated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_182\">106. At the relevant point of time, there could have been no occasion for the\n\n    respondent to cancel the tender on the basis of the Urban Development and\n\n    Municipal Affairs Department’s order dated 01.12.2022. We say so because:-\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">    (i)     First, as per the aforesaid order, it was explicitly clarified that the\n\n            respondent would continue to retain the operation &amp; maintenance as-well\n\n            as the advertisement rights of the concerned underpasses .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">    (ii)    Secondly, only the structural maintenance and restoration of the E.M.\n\n            Bypass’s carriageway, roads, underground drainage etc. were to be handed\n\n            over to the KMC. Indisputably, the tender that was issued in favour of the\n\n            appellant was distinct from the maintenance that was handed over to KMC\n\n            inasmuch as the scope of work of tender was limited to cleaning the roads,\n\n            walls, floors etc., maintaining the electric-fixtures and upkeep of the\n\n            gardens.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">    (iii)   Thirdly, despite the stance of the respondent of “change in scenario” due\n\n            to the handing over of the maintenance, we find that after cancelling the\n\n            tender and during the pendency of the present appeal, it was the respondent\n\n            who floated fresh tender for the work of maintenance in respect of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                            Page 68 of 83</span>\n\f            same underpasses and not KMC, thus fortifying our view that the aforesaid\n\n            change in policy had no bearing on the cancellation of the tender.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">107. It is only on 16.09.2023 i.e., much after the cancellation of the tender that the\n\n      Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department, Government of West\n\n      Bengal modified its earlier order whereby both, the control along with the right\n\n      to revenue for the said structures were handed over to KMC from the\n\n      respondent. This leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the concerned\n\n      minister’s decision to cancel the tender on account of purported ‘change in\n\n      policy’ was without any application of mind, capricious and influenced by\n\n      malice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">\n b.      Concept of Public Interest in Administrative Decisions.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">108. The reluctance on the part of the respondent to cancel the tender is also evident\n\n      from Note #97, wherein the authority expressed its concern over the potential\n\n      consequences of such cancellation. The respondent apprehended that in the\n\n      event the tender for work was being cancelled, the routine maintenance of the\n\n      underpasses would be disrupted. Due to this, the underpasses would have to\n\n      be closed until some other agency could take over the maintenance. The\n\n      relevant observations read as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">           “Note # 97\n           [...] Besides, the underpasses are being maintained by the bidder.

From the above it is evident that the cancellation of the tender was not in\n\n    public interest. It may also not be out of place to mention that as per the\n\n    internal file-notings the respondent had itself acknowledged that the revenue\n\n    model of the aforesaid tender for work was far more beneficial and was\n\n    fetching higher rates than the existing models of other agencies on the E.M.\n\n    Bypass. The relevant observations read as under: -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">          “Note # 88\n          [...] In this model KMDA is saving Rs. 90.00 Lacs per year mentioned\n          in Note#49 and earned Rs.62,67,110/- per year with 5% increment for\n          each year.

It has been contended by the respondent that due to the\n\n    ambiguity in tender as regards placement of advertisements, many interested\n\n    bidders might not have been able to submit their bids.

However, we are not impressed with the above submission. As discussed in\n\n    the preceding paragraphs of this judgment, nothing to this effect is even\n\n    remotely indicated from the internal file notings of the respondent or the\n\n    materials on record. There is nothing to suggest that there was a technical fault\n\n    in the tender resulting in financial losses or that there was a possibility of\n\n    fetching higher license fees. On the contrary, it can be seen that the respondent\n\n    itself was of the opinion that the tender for work was financially beneficial to\n\n    it. This further undermines the claims of technical faults or potential financial\n\n    losses, and suggests that the decision to cancel the tender was not based on\n\n    genuine financial concerns but rather on other, possibly extraneous factors.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">112. Even assuming for a moment that there was a technical fault in the tender,\n\n    which if rectified had the possibility of generating more revenue, the same by\n\n    no stretch could be said to be a cogent reason for cancelling an already existing\n\n    tender. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74190276\" id=\"span_130\">In this regard reference may be made to the decision of this Court in\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/74190276/\" id=\"a_128\">Vice Chariman &amp; Managing Director, City &amp; Industrial Development\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                          Page 71 of 83</span>\n\f    Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd. &amp; Anr. v.

Power Management\n\n    Company Ltd.</a> (supra) wherein this Court observed that merely because the\n\n    rates embodied in a contract with the passage of time have become less\n\n    appealing, the same cannot become a determinative criterion for either\n\n    terminating the contract or for the courts to decline interference in such\n\n    contractual disputes.

Therefore, on a conspectus of the case law, we find that the\n          concept of overwhelming public interest has essentially evolved in the\n          context of cases relating to the award of contract by the State. It\n          becomes an important consideration in the question as to whether then\n          the State with whatever free play it has in its joints decides to award a\n          contract, to hold up the matter or to interfere with the same should be\n          accompanied by a careful consideration of the harm to public interest.\n          We do not go on to say that consideration of public interest should not\n          at all enter the mind of the court when it deals with a case involving\n          repudiation of a claim under a contract or for that matter in the\n          termination of the contract. However, there is a qualitative State enters\n          into the contract, rights are created. If the case is brought to the\n          constitutional court and it is invited to interfere with State action on the\n          score that its action is palpably arbitrary, if the action is so found then\n          an appeal to public interest must be viewed depending on the facts of\n          each case. If the aspect of public interest flows entirely on the basis that\n          the rates embodied in the contract which is arbitrarily terminated has\n          with the passage of time become less appealing to the State or that\n          because of the free play of market forces or other developments, there\n          is a fall in the rate of price of the services or goods then this cannot\n          become determinative of the question as to whether court should\n          decline jurisdiction. In this case, it is noteworthy that the rates were in\n          fact settled on the basis of international competitive bidding and in\n          which as many as 182 bidders participated and the rate offered by the\n          first respondent was undoubtedly the lowest. The fact that power has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                                Page 73 of 83</span>\n\f          become cheaper in the market subsequently by itself should not result\n          in non-suiting of the complaint of the first respondent, if it is found that\n          a case of clear arbitrariness has been established by the first\n          respondent.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">          89.

What can be discerned from the above is that this Court has consistently\n\n    underscored that any decision to terminate a contract must be grounded in a\n\n    real and palpable public interest, duly supported by cogent materials and\n\n    circumstances in order to ensure that State actions are fair, transparent, and\n\n    accountable. Public interest cannot be used as a pretext to arbitrarily terminate\n\n    contracts and there must be a clear and demonstrable ramification or detriment\n\n    on the public interest to justify any such action.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">116. Considerations of public interest should not be narrowly confined to financial\n\n    aspects. The courts must have a more holistic understanding of public interest\n\n    wherever the fairness of public authorities is in question, giving due regard to\n\n    the broader implications of such action on the stability of contractual\n\n    obligations. Merely because the financial terms of a contract are less\n\n    favourable over a period of time does not justify its termination. Such\n\n    decisions must be based on a careful consideration of all relevant factors,\n\n    including the potential harm to the integrity and sanctity of contractual\n\n    relationships. The larger interest of upholding contracts cannot be discarded\n\n    in the name of monetary gain labelled as public interest.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                                 Page 74 of 83</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1159364\" id=\"span_136\">117.

It further held\n\n    that the enforcement of rights and obligations arising out of a contract cannot\n\n    depend on whether the contracting party finds it prudent to abide by it. The\n\n    relevant observations read as under: -</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">          “16.

Thus, we are of the view that the respondent’s stance of a mere possibility of\n\n    fetching higher license fees was no ground to cancel the tender issued to the\n\n    appellant for the purposes of rectifying it, especially when the respondent\n\n    completely failed to demonstrate as to how there was a technical fault in the\n\n    tender or how potential interested bidders did not participate due to it or how\n\n    fetching higher license fees was more than a mere possibility.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">119. At this stage, we may also answer one another submission that was canvassed\n\n    on behalf of the respondent as regards the other aspect of public interest\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                              Page 75 of 83</span>\n\f    besides the monetary gain. It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that\n\n    the decision to cancel the tender was also keeping in mind the considerations\n\n    such as being able to engage experts for maintenance of critical public\n\n    infrastructure. It is the case of the respondent that the tender was cancelled in\n\n    order to float separate tenders, one for the maintenance work and another for\n\n    licensing advertisement rights to ensure expertise in each respective field.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">120. We are not impressed by the above submission either. We need not refer to a\n\n    copious amount of documents in this regard, as just a bare perusal of the notice\n\n    inviting tender shows that the eligibility criterion for participating in the tender\n\n    process prescribed a comprehensive threshold of requirement of experience in\n\n    structural works and successful completion of similar natured projects, thus\n\n    ensuring that the bidders participating in the tender possess the necessary\n\n    expertise for the work of maintenance.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">121. Even otherwise, if at all the respondent was very much concerned about the\n\n    maintenance of the underpasses due to lack of expertise of the appellant, it\n\n    was always open to the respondent to terminate the contract in terms of the\n\n    termination clause as envisaged in Clause 35 of the Special Terms &amp;\n\n    Conditions of the Memorandum for the breach or non-compliance of any of\n\n    the obligations or terms of the tender.

Public tenders are designed to provide a level playing field for all potential\n\n    bidders, fostering an environment where competition thrives, and the best\n\n    value is obtained for public funds. The integrity of this process ensures that\n\n    public projects and services are delivered efficiently and effectively,\n\n    benefiting society at large. The principles of transparency and fairness\n\n    embedded in public tender processes also help to prevent corruption and\n\n    misuse of public resources. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"540140\" id=\"span_140\">In this regard we may refer to the observations\n\n    made by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/540140/\" id=\"a_131\">Nagar Nigam v. Al. Farheem Meat Exporters Pvt.

The sanctity of public tenders lies in their role in upholding the principles of\n\n     equal opportunity and fairness. Once a contract has come into existence\n\n     through a valid tendering process, its termination must adhere strictly to the\n\n     terms of the contract, with the executive powers to be exercised only in\n\n     exceptional cases by the public authorities and that too in loathe. The courts\n\n     are duty bound to zealously protect the sanctity of any tender that has been\n\n     duly conducted and concluded by ensuring that the larger public interest of\n\n     upholding bindingness of contracts are not sidelined by a capricious or\n\n     arbitrary exercise of power by the State.

The sanctity of contracts is a fundamental principle that underpins the stability\n\n     and predictability of legal and commercial relationships. When public\n\n     authorities enter into contracts, they create legitimate expectations that the\n\n     State will honour its obligations. Arbitrary or unreasonable terminations\n\n     undermine these expectations and erode the trust of private players from the\n\n     public procurement processes and tenders. Once a contract is entered, there is\n\n     a legitimate expectation, that the obligations arising from the contract will be\n\n     honoured and that the rights arising from it will not be arbitrarily divested\n\n     except for a breach or non-compliance of the terms agreed thereunder. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"36312633\" id=\"span_142\">In this\n\n     regard we may make a reference to the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/36312633/\" id=\"a_133\">Sivanandan\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\"> Civil Appeal No. 6741 of 2024                                             Page 79 of 83</span>\n\f    C.T. v.
