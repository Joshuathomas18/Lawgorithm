The petitioner herein is a Company incorporated in Switzerland\n\nand is engaged in the business of trading in fertilizers.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.    The respondent is a Company registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_5\">Companies\n\nAct, 1956</a> having its registered office at Hyderabad, India, which is\n\nalso engaged in the business of trading in fertilizers.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.    The petitioner and respondent entered into a contract &#x27;KTS\n\n201310338&#x27; dt.30-4-2013 whereby the petitioner agreed to sell and the\n\nrespondent agreed to by 50,000 Metric Tonnes (M.T.) of\n\nDi Ammonium Phosphate (for short, &#x27;D.A.P.&#x27;) (later split into two\n\ncontracts) with a shipping tolerance of Â±10% at the option of the\n\npetitioner at a price of US $ 515 per M.T. on C.F.R. basis. The value\n                                    4                                MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nof this contract is US $ 25.75 Million equivalent to Rs.167.37 crores.\n\nIt provided that payment was to be by irrevocable confirmed Letter of\n\nCredit (for short &#x27;LC&#x27;) payment at sight and the LC was to be\n\nestablished by State Bank of India or another bank acceptable to\n\nsellers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.      Subsequently, on 28.05.2013, the above contract was split into\n\ntwo contracts (KTS201310338.1 and KTS201310338.2) of 25,000\n\nM.T. each at the option of the petitioner.       All other terms and\n\nconditions including the price which was US $ 515 M.T. remained the\n\nsame.      In this split contract the mode of payment was by an\n\nirrevocable LC established by State Bank of India or any Bank\n\nacceptable to petitioner. It provided that the governing Law was to be\n\nEnglish Law and in the event of disputes, the arbitration was to be\n\nheld in London under the L.C.I.A. Rules by a panel of three arbitrators\n\nwho shall be commercial men.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.      After the contracts were signed, petitioner nominated a vessel\n\n&#x27;MV Bulk Leo&#x27; with a capacity of 50,000 M.T. The respondent\n\nhowever requested for extension of the shipping date on the ground\n\nthat they were waiting for payment of a Government subsidy, and in\n\nthe meantime was not in a good enough financial condition to open\n\nthe required LCs. So the petitioner agreed to the respondent&#x27;s request.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">7.      Later parties entered into four different amendments by\n\nextending the shipping dates from time to time as mentioned below.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">                                      5                              MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">8.      According to petitioner, these amendments were pursuant to\n\nrespondent&#x27;s request due to different reasons.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">9.      Under the Amendment No.1, reflecting the delayed shipping\n\ndate until 2nd half of June, 2013 the petitioner nominated a vessel &#x27;MV\n\nAoyama&#x27; of capacity 50,000 M.T. on 12.6.2013 and requested the\n\nrespondent for opening of the L.C.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">10.     This was not acted upon in view of the respondent&#x27;s request on\n\n12-6-2013 to delay the shipping date until July, 2013 citing the non\n\nreceipt of anticipated government subsidy as well as falling value of\n\nthe Indian Rupee vis-a-vis the US $. This was agreed to by the\n\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">11.     On 20.6.2013, petitioner again nominated a vessel &#x27;MV\n\nHarrier&#x27; with Laycan 4/10 July,2013, but the respondent again\n\nrequested for extension of the shipping date stating that their Banker\n\nwas refusing to open the LCs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">12.     In view of the said request, the parties entered into Amendment\n\nNo.2 on 20.6.2013 reflecting the revised shipping dates pushing them\n\nback to 25/30 July, 2013 , but all other terms of contract remained the\n\nsame.     Though the above vessel&#x27;s nomination was accepted by\n\nrespondent on 21.6.2013, respondent sought reduction in price,\n\ncredit/usance to the maximum possible. Petitioner at that time refused\n\nto reduce the price, but offered to modify the payment clause allowing\n\nthe LCs to be paid 60 days from the Bill of Lading date.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">                                    6                                MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">13.   Thereafter, the parties entered on 10.07.2013 into an\n\nAmendment No.3 as per the request of the respondent incorporating\n\nthe deviation in payment clause as above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">14.   It is not in dispute that on 03.05.2013 the Government of India\n\nissued an Office Memorandum reducing the price for availing subsidy\n\nfor D.A.P. to Rs.24,000 per M.T. and on 26.06.2013, it issued another\n\nOffice Memorandum reiterating the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">15.   On 08.07.2013, the respondent&#x27;s representative sent an e-mail\n\nto the petitioner informing it about the challenges faced by the\n\nrespondent due to the formulation of policies relating to the fertilizer\n\nindustry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">16.   After the Amendment no.3 was signed, on 11.07.2013, the\n\npetitioner nominated a vessel &#x27;Nikolaos A&#x27; to load 50,000 M.T. with\n\nLaycan put on 21/28 July 2013, but the respondent contacted the\n\npetitioner and rejected petitioner&#x27;s vessel nomination by sending an\n\ne-mail on 11.07.2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">17.   On 12.07.2013, discussion took place between the parties\n\nthrough a conference call wherein the respondent referred to its\n\nfinancial problems, and in addition, asked for more time proposing a\n\nnumber of other destinations for the cargo including a proposal for\n\nsale by the petitioner of the cargo to some third party albeit at the\n\nlower current market price to which petitioner&#x27;s representative\n\nresponded that loss should be borne by the respondent if such a\n                                    7                                   MSR,J\n                                                                 exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nmitigation sale took place. The petitioner in turn proposed that if\n\nrespondent honoured the parties&#x27; contracts at the agreed price of $ 515\n\nper M.T., it could possibly sell the cargo at $ 470 Dollars per M.T.\n\nand submitted on 13.07.2013 the Amendment No.4 for respondent&#x27;s\n\ncounter-signature pushing the shipment dates to mid- September,\n\n2013 and requiring the respondent to open L.C.s by five days prior to\n\nthe vessel&#x27;s Laycan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">18.   The 4th amendment was counter-signed by the respondent on\n\n06.08.2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">19.   Before that on 19.07.2013, the petitioner&#x27;s representatives met\n\nthe respondent&#x27;s representatives at New Delhi and in the said meeting,\n\nthe respondent stated that it is in receipt of subsidy money and was in\n\na position to open L.C.s, but the Fertilizer Association of India warned\n\nit against importing the cargo at a price well above the current market\n\nvalue. According to the petitioner, the respondent&#x27;s representative\n\nMr.Bhaskaran, while acknowledging that a contract is a contract,\n\nallegedly made a request to the petitioner for reducing price as well as\n\nthe quantity of D.A.P. to 40,000 M.T. which would help the\n\nrespondent to reduce its loss. This is disputed by respondent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">20.   On 22.7.3013, petitioner proposed Amendment No.5 reducing\n\nthe price to $ 505 and the quantity to 40,000 MT and providing\n\npayment through LC 60 days, with LC to be established by 16.8.2013\n\nand shipment by 15.9.2013. This according to the petitioner is the\n                                    8                                 MSR,J\n                                                               exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nAmendment No.5 and it is contended by petitioner that this was\n\nagreed to by respondent and is binding on the respondent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">21.   The respondent however did not return the same to petitioner\n\nafter it was signed by it&#x27;s representative. The respondent contends that\n\nit had never signed Amendment No.5 to the contract, and contends\n\nthat the petitioner cannot place any reliance on it and that the\n\nproposals contained in the said Amendment did not bind it.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">22.   On 12.08.2013, the petitioner nominated a vessel &quot;MV Navios\n\nArc&#x27; of 40,000 M.T. in terms of agreement which had a laycan of\n\n23/30 August 2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">23.   On 13.08.2013, the respondent informed the petitioner on\n\ntelephone that it would be hard to accept the vessel&#x27;s nomination\n\nunless directed by their legal team; and through an email that it has\n\nnot been receiving a favorable response from it&#x27;s bankers in view of\n\nthe price not being in accordance with the prevailing market prices\n\nand it&#x27;s bankers are prohibiting them from proceeding further on the\n\ncontracts; that the Government of India will also not consider\n\nfavorably for release of subsidy at the prevailing prices in the\n\nagreement; that it wants to relocate the product to other markets and\n\ngive it time to complete the transaction on FOB Tampa basis. It\n\ntherefore requested petitioner to keep the vessel&#x27;s nomination on hold.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">24.   On 16.08.2013, the petitioner requested respondent to confirm\n\nif they intended to reject the nomination of the vessel pointing out that\n                                     9                                 MSR,J\n                                                                exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nin the event the respondent was rejecting the nomination, it should\n\nexplain why the nomination of the vessel was not in accordance with\n\nthe agreement. The respondent did not respond to this request. The\n\npetitioner therefore contends that the respondent failed to open the\n\nrequisite L.C.s within the stipulated time period and committed breach\n\nof contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_38\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">25.

It observed that the request of the\n\npetitioner for the return of the Amendment No.4 to the contract\n\nduly   signed   by       the   respondent   only   reflected   good\n\npost-contractual practice in ensuring that all the documentation\n\nwas signed off properly and that it showed nothing more than\n\ngood house-keeping;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">(g) accepted the petitioner&#x27;s submission that the evidence\n\nsupports petitioner&#x27;s argument of a bilateral agreement to revise\n\nthe quantity sold and supports also their case that the\n\nrespondent&#x27;s obligation to pay for the subject cargo was\n\ntriggered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">(h) also rejected the argument of the respondent based on the\n\nI.C.C.

It concluded that the respondent&#x27;s bad credit\n\ncaused by their failure to honour its obligations towards State\n\nBank of India did not give rise to a force majeur defence. It\n\nrejected the evidence of respondent&#x27;s witness that the State\n\nBank of India was not satisfied with the bona fides of the\n                                    13                                 MSR,J\n                                                                exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n      transaction and accepted petitioner&#x27;s submission that the\n\n      respondent could have approached another bank acceptable to\n\n      petitioner to open L.Cs. in accordance with the contracts if the\n\n      State Bank of India did not agree to do so;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">      (i) held that it was a classic case of a party attempting to excuse\n\n      its breach of contract on force majeure grounds where the\n\n     market had moved against them; and the respondent took no\n\n     steps to open L.C.s after receiving State Bank of India&#x27;s letter\n\n     dt.24.08.2013 because the respondents believed that at that time\n\n     it had became a bad deal;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">     (j) rejected the defence of frustration raised by the respondent\n\n     on the ground that considerations for the said defence were, in\n\n      effect, identical to those arising in relation to force majeure;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      (k) concluded that the measure of the petitioner&#x27;s loss was to be\n\n      determined pursuant to Section 50 of the English Sale of Goods\n\n      Act, 1979.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_56\">On that basis, since the respondent also agreed that the correct\n\napproach was to take the relevant F.O.B.

Tampa Price as at 12.09.2013, and\n\ncomputed the difference between the baseline C.F.R. Price of\n\n$ 505 per M.T. with F.O.B. Tampa plus freight $ 459 and arrived at\n\ndifference of $ 46. This figure was multiplied with 40,000 M.T.\n\nwhich was the quantity under the 22.07.2013 proposal, and\n                                     14                               MSR,J\n                                                               exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\ndetermined that $1,840,000 is to be paid by respondent to petitioner.

It\n\n   contended that continued delays in the receipt of Government\n\n   subsidies, combined with the effect of the MRP directive,\n\n   meant that respondent continued to face obstacles when\n\n   attempting to open LCs and therefore rejected the nomination\n\n   of the vessel by petitioner pursuant to the Amendment No.3.

On\n\n   12-07-2013, the parties held a teleconference where the\n\n   possibility of selling the DAP to a third party identified by\n\n   respondent was discussed and this sale would have resulted in a\n                                17                              MSR,J\n                                                         exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n   loss of $ 15 per MT to respondent, but no loss or cost to\n\n   petitioner.

The question, however, arises whether,\n          in the absence of any such alternative case in the plaint it is open to\n          the court to give him relief on that basis. The rule undoubtedly is\n          that the court cannot grant relief to the plaintiff on a case for which\n          there was no foundation in the pleadings and which the other side\n          was not called upon or had an opportunity to meet.

The plea of the\n          defendant was that the mortgage was void. This plea was given effect\n          to by both the lower courts as well as by the Privy Council.

Although no such alternative claim was made in the\n          plaint, the Privy Council allowed it to be advanced and gave a\n          decree on the ground that the respondent could not be prejudiced by\n          such a claim at all and the matter ought not to be left to a separate\n          suit.

The Court accepted that the position in England was equivocal\n\nbut held that the law should and does give effect to a contractual\n\nprovision requiring specified formalities to be observed for a\n\nvariation; but held that parties cannot validly bind themselves as to\n\nthe manner in which future changes in their legal relations are to be\n\nachieved, however clearly they express their intention to do so. It\n\nheld that nevertheless No Oral Modification clauses are commonly\n\nincluded in written agreements; there are legitimate commercial\n\nreasons for agreeing a clause like 7.6; and the law of contract does not\n\nnormally obstruct the legitimate intentions of businessmen, except for\n\noverriding reasons of public policy. Therefore there is no mischief in\n\nNo Oral Modification clauses, nor do they frustrate or contravene any\n\npolicy of the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">62.

The Court answered the said question stating that what the\n\nparties to a No Oral Modification clause have agreed is not that oral\n\nvariations are forbidden, but that they will be invalid. The mere fact\n\nof agreeing to an oral variation is not therefore a contravention of the\n\nclause. It is simply the situation to which the clause applies. It is not\n\ndifficult to record a variation in writing, except perhaps in cases where\n\nthe variation is so complex that no sensible businessmen would do\n\nanything else.   The natural inference from the parties&#x27; failure to\n\nobserve the formal requirements of a No Oral Modification clause is\n\nnot that they intended to dispense with it but that they overlooked it.\n\nIf, on the other hand, they had it in mind, then they were courting\n\ninvalidity with their eyes open.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">65.   More importantly it held that the enforcement of No Oral\n\nModification clauses carries with it the risk that a party may act on\n\nthe contract as varied, for example by performing it, and then find\n\nitself unable to enforce it.       The Court referred to the Vienna\n\nConvention and the UNIDROIT Model Code and stated that they\n\nqualify the principle that effect is to be given to No Oral Modification\n\nclauses, by stating that a party may be precluded by his conduct\n\nfrom relying on such a provision to the extent that the other party\n\nhas relied (or reasonably relied) on that conduct; in some legal\n\nsystems this result would follow from the concepts of contractual\n                                    45                                   MSR,J\n                                                                  exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\ngood faith or abuse of rights; and in England, the safeguard against\n\ninjustice lies in the various doctrines of estoppel. It stated that the\n\nscope of the estoppel is that (i) at the very least there would have to be\n\nsome words or conduct unequivocally representing that the variation\n\nwas valid notwithstanding its informality; and (ii) something more\n\nwould be required for this purpose than the informal promise itself. It\n\nalso held that it is unnecessary to deal with existence of\n\n&#x27;consideration&#x27; for the variation and is undesirable to do so.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">66.   Thus, according to English law as decided in Rock Advertising\n\nLimited (11 supra), normally No Oral Modification clauses would\n\nbe enforced except where a party acts on the contract as varied, for\n\nexample by performing it. In such an event, the doctrine of estoppel\n\nis applied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_184\">67.   It is important to note that before the Arbitral Tribunal, no\n\ncontention was raised by the respondent that even if an oral\n\nagreement/amendment       had    occurred    pursuant   to   the     e.mail\n\ndt.22-07-2013 (Amendment No.5), such oral amendment to the\n\nwritten contract is impermissible under English law. Without raising\n\nthe said contention before the Arbitrators or filing a petition under\n\nSection 68 of the English Arbitration Act, 1996 before the English\n\nCourt, I am of the opinion that the respondent cannot be allowed to\n\nraise it before this Court in proceedings to execute the award.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">68.   Assuming that it is entitled to raise the said plea, it is important\n\nto note that, in the instant case, there is no clause prohibiting oral\n                                   46                                MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nmodification to the contracts. There was no clause akin to clause 7.6\n\nin Rock Advertising (11 supra).

The true legal position in regard to the extension of time for the\n        performance of a contract is quite clear under <a href=\"/doc/1105874/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 63</a> of the\n        Indian Contract Act. Every promisee, as the section provides, may\n        extend time for the performance of the contract. The question as to\n        how extension of time may be agreed upon by the parties has been\n        the subject-matter of some argument at the Bar in the present\n        appeal. There can be no doubt, we think, that both the buyer and the\n        seller must agree to extend time for the delivery of goods. It would\n        not be open to the promisee by his unilateral act to extend the time\n        for performance of his own accord for his own benefit. It is true that\n        the agreement to extend time need not necessarily be reduced to\n        writing. It may be proved by oral evidence. In some cases it may be\n        proved by evidence of conduct. Forbearance on the part of the buyer\n        to make a demand for the delivery of goods on the due date as fixed\n        in the original contract may conceivably be relevant on the question\n        of the intention of the buyer to accept the seller&#x27;s proposal to extend\n        time. It would be difficult to lay down any hard and fast Rule about\n        the requirements of proof of such an agreement. It would naturally\n        be a question of fact in each case to be determined in the light of\n        evidence adduced by the parties. Having regard to the probabilities\n        in this case, and to the conduct of the parties at the relevant time, we\n        think the appellants are entitled to urge that their oral evidence\n        about the acceptance of the respondent&#x27;s proposal for the extension\n        of time should be believed and the finding of the learned trial Judge\n        on this question should be confirmed.&quot;(emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1136921\" id=\"span_25\">72.

A partnership firm occupied the\n\nshop on the authority of the rent note and continued its business in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">14</span>\n     (1976) 4 SCC 89\n                                    49                               MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nshop even after the expiry of the period of the rent note.          The\n\nrespondent No.2 also retired from the firm under a deed of dissolution\n\nand the other persons continued in the same premises under a\n\nreconstituted partnership. The respondent No.1 sought possession of\n\nthe shop from respondent No.2 and partners of the firm, who were\n\nappellants before the Supreme Court under the <a href=\"/doc/117135027/\" id=\"a_85\">East Punjab Urban\n\nRent Restriction Act, 1949</a> alleging that respondent No.2 was the\n\ntenant of the shop in his personal capacity and had unlawfully sublet\n\nthe shop to the firm. The appellants contended that respondent No.2\n\ndid not take the shop on rent in his personal capacity but as partner of\n\nthe firm and there was no subletting in favour of the firm or its\n\npartners. The Rent Controller accepted this contention and dismissed\n\nthe application, but the District Judge on appeal reversed this finding\n\naccepting the plea of respondent No.1. This was confirmed by the\n\nHigh Court. The Supreme Court held that under proviso (4) to Section\n\n92, it was open to the appellants to lead evidence to show that there\n\nwas, apart from the rent note, a distinct subsequent oral agreement\n\nunder which the terms of the original contract or grant were modified\n\nand that the partners of the firm, both before and after its\n\nrecomposition, were the real tenants of the shop. After considering\n\nthe evidence on record, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal\n\nstating that there is no evidence to accept the appellant&#x27;s case that\n\nrespondent No.2 had taken the premises from respondent No.1 on\n\nbehalf of the firm and not in his personal capacity.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">                                     50                                  MSR,J\n                                                                  exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_196\">75.     Therefore, both under English law and Indian law, it was\n\npermissible for the petitioner to prove that the original contract was in\n\nfact modified by an oral agreement whose terms were contained in the\n\ne.mail dt.22-07-2013 (Amendment No.5).             This can be done by\n\nrelying on oral evidence or by evidence of conduct of parties.\n\n\nWhether in the facts of the case, the Arbitral Tribunal was right in holding\nthat Amendment No.5 proposed by the petitioner was accepted by\nrespondent\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">76.     It is the contention of the petitioner that in a meeting held at\n\nNew Delhi on 19-07-2013, the respondent requested for a quantity\n\nreduction to 40,000 MT from 50,000 MT and a price reduction as\n\nwell.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_199\">77.     In the pre-hearing brief submitted by petitioner before the\n\narbitrators, at para 26 there is a specific plea by the petitioner that\n\nafter the meeting held at New Delhi on 19.7.2013, petitioner stood by\n\nthe respondent and, on 22.7.2013 accepted the respondent&#x27;s offer to\n\nreduce the quantity and price. But this acceptance was conditional\n\nupon the respondent moving forward with the deal. It is also pleaded\n\nthat in addition petitioner agreed to accept payment on basis of LC to\n\nbe established by 16.8.2013 and payable 60 days from Bill of Lading\n\nDate and to extend the shipment periods to 15.9.2013; that for more\n\nthan a week thereafter there was no substantive response by\n\nrespondent confirming this proposal; that in a telecom with Ravindra\n\n(respondent) on 31.7.2013, he again requested to sell cargo\n\nsomewhere else and promised to pay the difference; but the next day\n                                     51                                 MSR,J\n                                                                 exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\ni.e 1.8.2013, Bhaskaran ( respondent) called Seth ( petitioner) and\n\ninformed that    his legal department had asked him not to take a\n\ndecision and matter would be referred to respondent&#x27;s Board on\n\n9.8.2013; that on 5.8.2013, in a conference call, the respondent &#x27;s\n\nrepresentatives expressed that they were committed and wanted to\n\nfulfill all their obligations under the contract, and to do so &quot;ethically&quot;;\n\nthis was noted in the diary of the petitioner&#x27;s representative\n\nMr.Keyman; but after the Board meeting of respondent , petitioner did\n\nnot hear anything. So petitioner nominated on 12.8.2013, the vessel\n\n&quot;MV Navios Arc&quot; with lay/can 24/30 August, 2013 and which could\n\ncarry cargo of 39,000/40,000 MT and only on the next day,\n\nrespondent flatly refused to move forward on the contracts. It was\n\ncontended that respondent&#x27;s plea that there was no agreement to\n\nreduce the quantity did not make sense as the respondent had several\n\ntimes confirmed it, and once petitioner agreed to reduce the quantity,\n\neverything they did and said afterwards was framed in terms of 40,000\n\nMT for both contracts. In para 58 a specific plea was raised by\n\npetitioner stating that the nomination of the vessel with reduced\n\ncapacity of 40,000 MT was only at the request of the respondent on\n\n19.7.2013 which was acquiesced on 22.7.2013; that there was no\n\nreason for petitioner to nominate a vessel with 10000 MT more than\n\nthe quantity the parties intended to load and incur substantial dead\n\nload freight charges; and having requested for reduction of quantity,\n\nthe respondent should be estopped from contending that petitioner&#x27;s\n\nnomination of the vessel capable of carrying 40000 MT was not in\n                                    52                              MSR,J\n                                                             exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\naccordance with the contracts. In para 61, reference was also made to\n\nrespondent&#x27;s admission in the two letters addressed to State Bank of\n\nIndia about the reduced quantity. Thus the plea of estoppel by conduct\n\nof respondent was also specifically raised by petitioner and the\n\ncounsel for respondent is not correct in contending that there was no\n\nsuch contention raised by the petitioner before the tribunal. The\n\nstatement of respondent&#x27;s witness Mr.Ravindra that the respondent\n\nnever requested or agreed to a change in the quantity of DAP was\n\ndenied in para-24 of the petitioner&#x27;s pre-hearing brief.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_200\">78.   To buttress these contentions, e.mail dt.19-07-2013 addressed\n\nby Mr.Aditya Seth (for short &#x27;Mr.Seth&#x27;) of petitioner to others in\n\npetitioner Company is relied upon as also the oral evidence given by\n\nMr.Seth before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_201\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">79.   The evidence on record shows that petitioner&#x27;s representative\n\nsent the e.mail dt.22-07-2013 reducing the quantity to 40,000 MT and\n\nprice to $ 505 MT permitting LC to be established by 16-08-2013.\n\nOn 25-07-2013, the petitioner&#x27;s representative Mr.Seth by e.mail\n\nrequested Mr.Ravindra of the respondent to respond to its e.mail\n\ndt.22-07-2013. The respondent&#x27;s representative Mr.Ravindra did not\n\ndispute or disagree with the proposal contained in the e.mail\n\ndt.22-07-2013 and merely stated that &quot;we have discussed the proposal\n\nwith our Bankers, in view of the concerns raised by them. We have\n\nalready initiated the dialogue with them and shall revert to you.&quot; The\n\npetitioner&#x27;s representative Mr.Seth again wrote an e.mail on\n                                    53                                MSR,J\n                                                               exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n26-07-2013 requesting prompt action from the respondent and\n\nfollowed it up with another e.mail on 29-07-2013 sent by it&#x27;s\n\nPresident Melih Keyman.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_203\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">80.   It is not in dispute that the respondent addressed two letters both\n\ndated 17-08-2013 to the State Bank of India, Panjagutta Branch\n\nstating that &quot;we have entered into a sale contract with Keytrade AG,\n\nSwitzerland, for import of 20,000 MT of Di Ammonium Phosphate in\n\nbulk&quot;, that the shipment was scheduled for the 3rd week of September,\n\n2013 and LC has to be established in favour of petitioner at the\n\nearliest. The quantity of DAP covered by these two letters is 40,000\n\nMT and not 50,000 MT.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_206\">81.    If the respondent had not accepted Amendment No.5 and\n\nintended to act on it, they would not have written those letters. This\n\nindicates that the Amendment No.5 proposed by the petitioner by\n\ne.mail dt.22-07-2013 was not only accepted by the respondent, but\n\nalso acted upon by it. It cannot now turn around and contend that it\n\nhad never accepted it, and liability cannot be imposed on it by treating\n\nit as a modification to the written contracts dt.30-04-2013 and the\n\nsubsequent written modifications thereto.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_207\">82.   Though counsel for the respondent contended that the petitioner\n\nwas not aware of the letters dt.17-08-2013 addressed by the\n\nrespondent to the State Bank of India until much later and so cannot\n\nrely on the said conduct, I do not agree with the said contention.\n\nWhen the question is whether respondent had accepted the\n                                   54                                MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nAmendment No.5 proposal containing lesser quantity and lesser price,\n\nwhat the respondent did after it received Amendment No.5 through\n\nemail dt.22-7-2013 is critical and has a direct bearing, and cannot be\n\nignored merely because the petitioner at that time was not aware of it.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_208\">83.   Inter alia the circumstance about nomination by petitioner of\n\nthe vessel &quot;Navios Arc&quot; which can carry cargo upto 40,000 MT i.e the\n\npetitioner acting on the Amendment No.5, triggering an estoppel, is\n\nalso mentioned in the order of the Arbitral Tribunal in support of its\n\nfinding that there is a bilateral agreement to revise the quantity sold\n\nand its conclusion that the respondent&#x27;s obligation to pay for the\n\nsubject cargo was triggered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_209\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_210\">84.   These circumstances cannot be said to be irrelevant to support\n\nthe said conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal nor can the conclusion be\n\nsaid to be perverse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_211\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">85.   Thus, I hold that the Arbitral Tribunal committed no error in\n\nholding that there was a binding agreement between the parties on the\n\nterms contained in e.mail dt.22-07-2013 (the Amendment No.5)\n\nwhich was an independent agreement and which was acted upon by\n\nboth parties i.e. by the petitioner by nominating the vessel &quot;Novios\n\nArc&quot; and by the respondent by writing letter to the State Bank of India\n\non 17-08-2013 that there it had in fact accepted such an agreement.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">86.   In view of the above, the contention of respondent that there\n\nwas no valid agreement in the eye of English law on the basis of the\n                                    55                               MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nproposal contained in the e.mail dt.22-07-2013 between the parties is\n\nrejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">87.   Respondent&#x27;s plea that by conduct of parties in relation to\n\namendment nos.1 to 4 (form and format with signatures of both\n\nparties), both parties have agreed to a &#x27;No Oral Modification&#x27; clause\n\nin their contractual relationship, cannot be accepted because if the\n\nparties really wanted such a clause, they would have specifically\n\nincorporated it, but admittedly, there is no such clause.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">88.   It&#x27;s further plea that the prior amendments were all put in\n\nwriting and signed by it and absence of such written document as\n\nregards Amendment No.5 indicate that it was only a proposal which\n\nwas never accepted, also cannot be countenanced. The reasoning of\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal that signing and returning of earlier amendments\n\nis nothing more than good post contractual practice in ensuring that all\n\nthe documentation was signed off properly and that it is nothing more\n\nthan good house keeping, is unexceptionable.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_217\">89.   Therefore I hold (i) that the Arbitral Tribunal was right in\n\nrejecting the respondent&#x27;s contention that nomination on 12-08-2013\n\nof the vessel &quot;Navios Arc&quot; with minimum/maximum cargo of\n\n39,000/40,000 MT was not in accordance with the terms of the\n\ncontracts (as amended by Amendment No.4) which contemplated\n\npurchase of 50,000 MT; and (ii) that the agreement inferred by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal on the basis of the terms contained in Amendment\n                                    56                                 MSR,J\n                                                                exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nno.5 contained in the e-mail dt.22.07.2013 was valid under English\n\nLaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_219\">90.    The respondent is also not correct in it&#x27;s plea that the initial\n\nclaim of the petitioner is based on the Amendment no.4 only before\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal and its alternative plea was based on the\n\nproposal in e-mail dt.22.07.2013 on the basis of facts which came into\n\nrecord during the course of arbitration (such as the two letters\n\naddressed to State Bank of India by the petitioner on 17.08.2013\n\nmentioning that it had a sale contract with petitioner to import 20,000\n\nM.T. of D.A.P.) and so estoppel by conduct cannot be applied on the\n\nbasis of events which the petitioner was not aware of at that time.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_220\">91.    According to respondent, there was in fact a request by the\n\npetitioner to reduce the quantity and price in the meeting between the\n\nrepresentatives of both parties held at New Delhi on 19.07.2013 at\n\nwhich the respondent, while acknowledging that &quot;a contract is a\n\ncontract&quot; requested for price reduction and quantity reduction too.\n\nEx.69-email dt.19.07.2013 of Mr. Seth addressed to Mr. Keyman\n\nMelih corroborates this. It was in response to this request of the\n\nrespondent, Amendment no.5 contained in e-mail dt.22.07.2013\n\nemanated from the petitioner reducing the quantity and price.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_221\">92.    In the e-mail dt.25.07.2013, the respondent merely stated that it\n\nhas to discuss the proposal with its bankers (Ex.72) and would revert.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_222\">                                      57                               MSR,J\n                                                                exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_223\">93.    The conduct of the respondent in not refusing the Amendment\n\nno.5, and after the vessel &#x27;M.V. Navios Arc&#x27; was nominated on\n\n12.08.2013 (Ex.82), not rejecting its nomination immediately but\n\nmerely requesting through its e-mail dt.13.08.2013 &quot;to hold the vessel\n\nnomination&quot; are all factors on the basis of which the petitioner\n\nbelieved that there was an agreement in terms of Amendment No.5.\n\nThe conduct of the respondent in addressing letters dt.17.08.2013 to\n\nS.B.I. is an additional circumstance which supports the petitioner&#x27;s\n\ncase since those letters contained an admission by the respondent that\n\nit had entered into a sale contract for 40,000 M.T. with petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_224\">94.

Also, the e-mails on which reliance is placed by the respondent\n\ndo not in any way reduce the effect of the conduct of the respondent in\n\nwriting to the State Bank of India on 17-08-2013 seeking LCs by\n\nstating that it had entered into two agreements to purchase 20,000 MT\n\neach (in all for only 40,000 MT modifying the earlier quantity of\n\n50,000 MT) from the petitioner. No prejudice therefore can be said to\n\nhave been caused to the respondent by not referring to the other\n\ne-mails exchanged between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_231\">\nWhether the award is contrary to the public policy of India? and\n\nWhether the Arbitrators were right in holding that the respondent cannot\nplead force majeure ?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_232\">98.   It is the contention of the respondent that the contract\n\ncontemplated an LC to be given by State Bank of India, but the said\n\nBank refused to provide LC facility to the respondent relying on\n\npolicy of the Union of India with regard to Fertilizer Price Control\n\nOrder under the <a href=\"/doc/774360/\" id=\"a_89\">Essential Commodities Act, 1955</a>.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_233\">99.    Counsel contended that for 2012-13, the Government approved\n\nproposal for fixation of rates of subsidy on DAP at Rs.14,350/- per\n\nMT in order to make them available at a price lower than its delivered\n\ncost, but for 2013-14, there was a further change made on\n\n03-05-2013/25-06-2013 reducing the subsidy on DAP to Rs.12,350/-\n\nper MT and this was done because of the falling International prices\n                                     59                               MSR,J\n                                                               exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nhaving no corresponding decrease in domestic prices. According to\n\nhim, it became mandatory for all Fertilizer Companies to submit\n\ncertified Cost Data while claiming subsidy and if MRP is not found\n\nreasonable, the Government would restrict or deny subsidy.\n\nAccording to him, the State Bank of India was reluctant to open LCs\n\nfor the above reason.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_234\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_235\">100. It is not in dispute that the State Bank of India addressed two\n\nletters to the respondent on 08-07-2013 and 24-08-2013 in response to\n\nthe request of the respondent for opening LC to buy the cargo of DAP\n\nfrom the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_236\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_237\">101. The first letter dt.08-07-2013 gives two reasons for not opening\n\nLC as per the respondent&#x27;s request: (a) that respondent was\n\nconsistently defaulting on its LCs that year and (b) its procurement\n\nprice is higher than the current market price and so it would be\n\ndifficult for the Bank to approve LCs despite the respondent having\n\nLC limits as there is a risk of further defaults.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">102. The second letter dt.24-08-2013 also states that the contract\n\nprice was not in accordance with the prevailing market price. No\n\ndoubt another reason viz., that there is a difference in the application\n\nof LC (which was made for 40,000 MT DAP purchase) and the\n\nagreement dt.30-04-2013 and Amendment No.4 dt.12-06-2013 (which\n\nmentioned 50,000 MT DAP purchase). There is no mention of the\n\nGovernment of India Fertilizer Policy at all in this letter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_239\">                                    60                               MSR,J\n                                                              exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_240\">103. In my opinion, the main anxiety of the State Bank of India\n\nappears to be the fact that there was a delay in receipt of Government\n\nsubsidy and if there is a high cost of import, it would push up the\n\nrespondent&#x27;s selling cost and increase the subsidy receivables.        It\n\ntherefore advised in its letter dt.08-07-2013 to the respondent to\n\nreduce input cost and expedite realizations so that there will not be\n\nany risk of further defaults on the LCs. Thus the refusal of the Bank\n\nto open LCs appears to be a purely commercial decision of the Bank\n\nbased on bad credit history of the respondent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_241\">104. Moreover, the Office Memorandums dt.03-05-2013 and 26-06-\n\n2013 relied upon by the respondent deal with the price at which a\n\nCompany can avail subsidy on DAP, but do not deal with import of\n\nDAP nor do they prohibit it&#x27;s import. They also did not put any cap on\n\nthe price for importing fertilizer. So respondent can still import the\n\nDAP and sell it, but it cannot claim subsidy. So if the respondent\n\nwere to import fertilizer at the contractual price, it would not be\n\ncommitting violation of any law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_242\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_243\">105. Also, no where in the contracts entered into between the parties\n\nor four amendments thereto is there any mention about performance\n\nof the contracts being subject to the respondent availing subsidy.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_244\">106. A further contention was raised by the respondent that the State\n\nBank of India refused to open LC in its letter dt.24.08.2013 in view of\n\nthe policy change enunciated by the Government of India contained in\n                                    61                                 MSR,J\n                                                                exep_3_ 2017\n\n\n\n\nthe notification issued on 03.05.2013 with regard to reduction in the\n\nsubsidy of fertilizers and this constituted a force majeure event\n\nabsolving the respondent of any liability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_245\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_246\">107. This contention is not tenable as the Office Memorandum\n\ndt.03-05-2013 providing subsidy for 2013-14 was issued by the\n\nGovernment of India much prior to Amendment No.5 dt.22-07-2013.\n\nIt therefore cannot be said to be a force majeure event which was\n\nunforeseeable at the time when Amendment No.5 was agreed between\n\nthe parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_247\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_248\">108.

Alternatively, the instant foreign\n\naward based on English law cannot be tested on the basis of an Indian\n\nstatute like FEMA and if it is so tested, it would frustrate the basic\n\npurpose of the New York Convention to enforce foreign awards.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_264\">119.
