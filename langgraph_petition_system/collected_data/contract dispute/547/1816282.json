Arguments heard for final disposal on the\nrequest of the counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1. This civil writ petition is filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article\n226</a> of the Constitution of India for directing the\nrespondent No. 1 Punjab National Bank to remit Rs. 52.50\nlacs under the bank guarantee to the petitioner and\nquash letter of the respondent No. 1 dated 13.12.2000.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2. Briefly the facts as disclosed by the pleadings\nare that the Indian Railway Construction (IRCON) awarded\na contract of construction of a railway station and\ncommercial complex at Belapur to the petitioner. The\npetitioner in turn divided the contract into smaller\nparts and gave the same to sub contracts. A sub\ncontract was given to the respondent No. 2 Puri\nInternational (P) Ltd. also. In pursuance thereof the\npetitioner issued the work order to the respondent No. 2\non 22.11.1990. The respondent No. 2 was entitled to\nreceive mobilisation advance to the extent of 5% of the\ncontract value and the said advance was payable to it\nagainst furnishing a bank guarantee issued by a\nnationalised/scheduled bank on the proforma provided by\nthe petitioner. Beside this the respondent No. 2 was\nalso required to furnish bank guarantee for security\ndeposit for 2% of the contract value. In all 7 bank\nguarantees of the total amount of Rs. 52.50 lacs were\nissued by the respondent No. 1 on behalf of respondent\nNo. 2 in favor of the petitioner. The bank guarantees\nfurnished by the respondents were unconditional and\npayable without any demur merely on demand from the\npetitioner stating that the amount was due by way of\nloss or damage caused to or suffered by the petitioner\nby reason of or any breach by the respondent No. 2\nfailure to perform the said contract. The petitioner\nwas also required to furnish bank guarantee of similar\namount in favor of IRCON and the bank guarantees\nfurnished by the respondent No. 2 and the petitioner were\nas such back to back bank guarantees.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3. IRCON on 12.2.1992 terminated the contract of the\npetitioner on the ground that the progress of the work\nwas slow. The petitioner in turn terminated the\ncontract of the respondent No. 2, being back to back, on\n31.3.1992. Thereafter, by letter dated 3.3.1994 the\npetitioner invoked certain bank guarantees of the total\namount of Rs. 17.50 lacs issued by the respondent No. 1 on\nthe ground that the respondent No. 2 had failed to pay\nback the mobilisation advance taken by it with interest\naccrued thereon. Other bank guarantees were also\ninvoked on different dates but the respondent No. 1\nneither encashed the bank guarantee nor sent any reply\nnor remitted the amount claimed by the petitioner in\nterms of the bank guarantees. On 15.3.1995 the\npetitioner invoked all the bank guarantees of the total\namount of Rs. 52.50 lacs and asked the respondent No. 1 to\nremit the amount by encashing the sum as per the terms\nof the bank guarantees which were unconditional and were\npayable without demur and merely on demand.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4. This invocation was challenged by the respondent\nNo. 2 by filing a suit on 21.3.1995 in this court. It\nsought a permanent prohibitory injunction restraining\nthe petitioner from encashing or seeking to encash the\nbank guarantees in whole or in part. An application for\nad interim injunction for a similar relief was also\nfiled. This court by an ex parte ad interim injunction\norder restrained the petitioner from encashing the bank\nguarantees on the condition that the respondent No. 1\nwould keep the bank guarantees alive. The respondent\nNo. 2 also filed a petition under Section 20 read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 8(1)(b)</a> of Arbitration Act, 1940 before this\ncourt, inter alia, praying for appointment of an\narbitrator for deciding the dispute and claims of the\npetitioner and the respondent No. 2. It was contested by\nthe petitioner. A Learned single Judge by order dated\n31.3.1997 referred the dispute between the parties to\nthe sole arbitrator appointed by the petitioner in terms\nof the arbitration clause. It also restrained the\npetitioner from encashing the bank guarantees till the\naward was given by the arbitrator and it was made the\nrule of the court. In the injunction suit the learned\nsingle Judge held that since the bank guarantees had not\nbeen invoked in accordance with the terms of the bank\nguarantees, the bank guarantees cannot be permitted to\nbe encashed.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5. The petitioner challenged this order dated\n31.3.1997 before the Division Bench. In the meantime\nIRCON invoked the bank guarantee furnished by the\npetitioner amounting to Rs. 6.09 crores on 25.7.1997.\nThe petitioner on 1.8.1997 filed an application bearing\nOMP No. 147/97 under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act 1996 and prayed for injunction against\nencashment of the bank guarantees. The learned single\nJudge vide order dated 1.8.1997 dismissed the said\napplication as not maintainable. An appeal was\npreferred against this order and the Division Bench\ndismissed the appeal on 21.8.1997 observing that in view\nof the nature of the bank guarantees involved in the\npresent case it was not possible for the appellant to\nsustain the argument that the bank guarantees had not\nbeen properly invoked or that they have not been invoked\nin accordance with their tenor. The special leave\npetition filed by the petitioner was disposed off by the\nSupreme Court by order dated 21.8.1997 on the basis of\nan undertaking of the petitioner to pay back amount of\nRs. 6.09 crores in six equal Installments. A copy of the\norder of the Division Bench dated 17.9.1997 was then\nfiled in the appeal pending against the respondent No. 2\nbut the Division Bench dismissed the appeal holding that\nthe petitioner was not entitled to encash the bank\nguarantees as it had not quantified the liability and\nrecited the amount which was actually due in the letter\nof invocation. The petitioner pursued it in an SLP\nbefore the Supreme Court.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6. In the meantime the petitioner served a fresh\nnotice dated 15.11.2000 on the respondent No. 1 invoking\nthe bank guarantees and demanding encashment thereof. In\nthe invocation letter the petitioner had incorporated\nall the liabilities and the cause of damages suffered\nby it due to the failure on the part of the respondent\nNo. 2 to discharge its various obligations under the\ncontract. In view of the fresh letter of invocation all\nthe bank guarantees, the SLP became infructuous. The\nSupreme Court on 1.12.2000 dismissed the SLP on the\nstatement made by the counsel for the petitioner that\nthe petitioner had already issued a fresh letter of\ninvocation to the respondent. Thereafter, the\npetitioner had issued various reminders to the\nrespondent for remitting the amount of the bank\nguarantee pursuant to the fresh invocation letter but of\nno avail. Later by letter dated 13.12.2000 the\nrespondent No. 1 had turned down the payment of the\npetitioner on the ground that the SLP had been dismissed\nby the Supreme Court. The petitioner has sought\nquashing of the letter dated 13.12.2000 by which the\nrespondent No. 1 refused to pay the amount under the Bank\nguarantees and for direction to the respondent No. 1 to\npay the amount of Rs. 52.50 lacs vested under the bank\nguarantee to the petitioner.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">7. On noticing Mr. Sushil, chief manager of Punjab\nNational Bank, respondent No. 1 filed his counter\naffidavit in which a preliminary objection was raised as\nto the maintainability of the petition. It was\ncontended that the writ petition arose out of the\ncontract of bank guarantees issued by the respondent\nNo. 1 in favor of the petitioner at the instant of the\nrespondent No. 2 and the dispute fell within the\njurisdiction of the civil court, therefore, the remedy\nfor enforcement of the rights under the contract was by\nway of filing a civil suit in a civil court and that\nextraordinary discretionary jurisdiction of the court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution could not be\ninvoked by the petitioner since the disputed question\ninvolved is whether such a right was enforceable on the\nfacts and circumstances of the case. On merit it was\nsubmitted that 15 bank guarantees particulars of which\nwere mentioned in sub para B of para 3 of the counter\naffidavit were issued. These bank guarantees have been\nextended from time to time. In so far as the encashment\nof the bank guarantees by the petitioner is concerned,\nit was a subject matter of an earlier suit No. 691/95,\nFAO(OS) No. 127/97 and SLP No. 18959/00. The invocation\nletter dated 15.3.1995 was not in terms of the bank\nguarantees, therefore, the monies due there under was not\npayable. In the meantime respondent No. 2 filed civil\nsuit and obtained a temporary injunction against payment\nof the amount of those bank guarantees. On the\ndismissal of the SLP filed by the petitioner the ad\ninterim injunction order granted in favor of the\nrespondent No. 2 in the earlier suit was not\ndisturbed, therefore, the law division at the head office\nof the respondent No. 1 had advised that even on the\nfresh invocation of the bank guarantee on 15.11.2000,\npayment could not be made.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">8. The respondent No. 2 has not filed any reply. But\nafter the case was reserved for orders written\nsubmissions on behalf of the respondent No. 2 were made.\nThe written submissions filed behind the back of the\nother two parties should not be taken into consideration\nbut the submission made therein is basically legal and\nidentical to the pleadings of respondent No. 1,\ntherefore, even if it is mentioned here it will not\ncause any prejudice to any of the parties. It was\nstated that the dispute has already been referred for\narbitration which included the question of invocation of\nbank guarantees and the award has not been made and\npublished as yet. Ad interim injunction was granted in\na civil suit filed by the respondent No. 2 on 31.3.1997\nrestraining the petitioner from encashing the bank\nguarantees furnished by the respondent No. 1 in favor of\nthe petitioner and the respondent No. 2 was directed to\nkeep the bank guarantees alive till the award was made\nthe rule of the court. The invocation of the bank\nguarantees by the petitioner by fresh invocation letter\nis an abuse of the process of law since it was\nrestrained from invoking the bank guarantees till the\naward was made the rule of the court. Lastly it was\nstated that <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India was\nnot available for enforcing contractual obligations\nbetween the parties.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">9. Resistance of the respondent No. 1 to the\ninvocation of the bank guarantees by a fresh letter\ndated 15.11.2000 is not on the ground that the\ninvocation is not in terms of the bank guarantees but on\nthe ground that in the earlier civil suit filed by the\nrespondent No. 2, the petitioner was restrained from\ninvoking the bank guarantees on the basis of the\ninvocation letter dated 15.3.1995 since it was not in\naccordance with the terms of the bank guarantees.\nHowever, no such infirmity has been pointed out in the\nfresh invocation letter dated 15.11.2000. There is no\nplea of any of the respondents that it is not in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of the bank\nguarantees.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">10. The respondent No. 1 has refused to pay the amount\nof the bank guarantees pursuant to the fresh invocation\nletter dated 15.11.2000 on the ground that it has been\nrestrained by an interlocutory injunction order passed\nin a civil suit from making the payment and that it has\nbeen directed to keep the bank guarantees alive during\nthe pendency of the arbitration proceedings till the\naward was not made the rule of the court. It was stated\nthat an appeal to the Division Bench and an SLP to the\nSupreme Court filed by the petitioner have failed and\nthe ad interim injunction order is still in operation.\nTherefore, the law department of the respondent No. 1 had\nadvised it against honouring the invocation letter dated\n15.11.2000.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">11. The preliminary objection raised on behalf of the\nrespondent goes to the very root of the power and\njurisdiction of this court and maintainability of the\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution,\ntherefore, it needed to be attended to first.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">12. The preliminary objection raised by the\nrespondent is that the dispute about invocation of the\nbank guarantees or the non payment of the money due\nunder it has arisen out of a private contract between\nthe petitioner and the respondent No. 1. Therefore, the\nappropriate remedy for raising the dispute the decision\nwould be in a civil suit filed before a civil court and\nnot by way of invocation of extraordinary discretionary\njurisdiction vested in this court by <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India. He argued that a writ of\nmandamus cannot be issued to enforce a private right.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1019781\" id=\"span_1\">13. The counsel for the petitioner has however urged\nthat since the respondent is an instrumentality of the\nstate its committing a breach of the agreement and\nrefusing to pay the amount under the bank guarantees\ncould be assailed in a civil writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 226.</a> He\nhas referred to the judgment of this court in <a href=\"/doc/1019781/\" id=\"a_9\">Access\nMaritime Corporation v. Syndicate Bank and Anr.</a>,\n.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1358508\" id=\"span_2\">Reference was also made to the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1358508/\" id=\"a_10\">J.S.

The State of Kerala and Anr.</a>\n.</span>\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">14. The dispute between the parties relate to and\narise out of a private contract between the parties.\nThe respondent No. 1 has refused to pay the amount of the\nbank guarantees on its invocation by the petitioner in\nterms of the bank guarantees. The question which arises\nfor consideration is whether such a dispute could be\nraised for decision in the extraordinary discretionary\njurisdiction of this court under Article 226 and a writ\nof mandamus can be issued for enforcing it.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">15. <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India gives\nextraordinary discretionary jurisdiction to this court\nto give relief to the person who is aggrieved from\ninfringement of any of his fundamental rights and on\naccount of omission and commission of the\ninstrumentality of the State. The writ jurisdiction of\nthe court being extraordinary remedies are intended to\nbe applicable to exceptional cases in which ordinary\nremedies are not adequate. The grievance under a\nprivate contract will not fall within the purview of\nthis article. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_14\">State of U.P and Ors. v. Bridge</a>\nand roof Company (India) Ltd.  a\npublic sector Corporation entered into a work contract\nwith the Government of U.P. for rehabilitation and\nimprovement of certain stretch of road in the State. A\ndispute arose between them about certain terms and\nconditions of the contract and also the State\nGovernment&#x27;s retaining the benefit of reduction in the\nrate of sales tax and not passing it on to the\nCorporation. The Supreme Court made the following\nobservations which are aptly applicable to the facts of\nthe present case also:-</span>\n</p>\n  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;In our opinion, the very remedy adopted by\nthe respondent is misconceived. It is not\nentitled to any relief in these\nproceedings, i.e. in the writ petition\nfiled by it. The High Court appears to be\nright in nor pronouncing upon any of the\nseveral contentions raised in the writ\npetition by both the parties and in merely\nreiterating the effect of the other of the\nDeputy Commissioner made under the proviso\nto Section 8-D(1).\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Firstly, the contract between the parties\nis a contract in the realm of private law.\nIt is not a statutory contract. It is\ngoverned by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_15\">Contract\nAct</a> or, maybe, also by certain provisions\nof the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_16\">Sale of Goods Act</a>. Any dispute\nrelating to interpretation of the terms and\nconditions of such a contract cannot be\nagitated, and could not have been agitated\nin a writ petition. That is a matter\neither for arbitration as provided by the\ncontract or for the civil court, as the\ncase may be. Whether any amount is due to\nthe respondent from the appellant-Government under the contract\nand, if so, how much and the further\nquestion whether retention or refusal to\npay any amount by the Government is\njustified, or not, are all matters which\ncannot be agitated in or adjudicated upon\nin a writ petition. The prayer in the writ\npetition, viz., to restrain the Government\nfrom deducting a particular amount from the\nwrit petitioner&#x27;s bill(s) was not a prayer\nwhich could be granted by the High Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226.</a> Indeed, the High Court\nhas not granted the said prayer.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Secondly, whether there has been a\nreduction in the statutory liability on\naccount of a change in law within the\nmeaning of Sub-clause (4) of Clause 70 of\nthe contract is again not a matter to be\nagitated in the writ petition. That is\nagain a matter relating to interpretation\nof a term of the contract and should be\nagitated before the arbitrator or the civil\ncourt, as the case may be. If any amount\nis wrongly withheld by the Government, the\nremedy of the respondent is to raise a\ndispute as provided by the contract or to\napproach the civil court, as the case may\nbe, according to law. Similarly if the\nGovernment says that any overpayment has\nbeen made to the respondent, its remedy\nalso is the same.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">Accordingly, it must be held that the writ\npetition filed by the respondent for the\nissuance of a writ of mandamus restraining\nthe Government from deducting or\nwithholding a particular sum, which\naccording to the respondent is payable to\nit under the contract, was wholly\nmisconceived and was not maintainable in\nlaw. The writ petition ought to have been\ndismissed on this ground alone&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">16. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"318728\" id=\"span_6\">In the case of the <a href=\"/doc/318728/\" id=\"a_18\">Kerala State Electricity Board\nv. Kurien E. Kalathil and Ors.</a>, \nthere was an agreement between the parties for\nconstruction of a dam. The Government enhanced the\nminimum wages payable to the employees employed in the\nwork but later on clarified that it will not be\napplicable to the labourers employed for construction of\nthe dam. In the meantime, labour escalation charges for\na certain period were paid by the Kerala State\nElectricity Board which on receipt of subsequent\nnotification were discontinued. The dispute arose\nbetween the parties relating to the interpretation of a\nclause in the contract and implementation of such\nclause. It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that\nsuch dispute was not a subject matter of writ petition\nand the remedy of the aggrieved person lies in\napproaching the civil court or some other appropriate\nforum. The Supreme Court held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> &quot;We find that there is a merit in the\nfirst contention of Mr. Raval. Learned\ncounsel has rightly questioned the\nmaintainability of the writ petition.\nThe interpretation and implementation of\na clause in a contract cannot be the\nsubject-matter of a writ petition.\nWhether the contract envisages actual\npayment or not is a question of\nconstruction of contract. If a term of a\ncontract is violated, ordinarily the\nremedy is not the writ petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226&quot;.</a>\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">17. The law enunciated in the above two judgments is\nfully applicable on the facts of the present case also.\nThe bank guarantee furnished by the respondent No. 1 in\nfavor of the petitioner at the instance of the\nrespondent No. 2 is a private contract and not a\nstatutory contract. It is governed by the provision of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_20\">Contract Act</a>. The dispute relating to the\ninterpretation of the terms and conditions of such\ncontract and the validity of the invocation of the bank\nguarantee and whether the amount was payable by the\nrespondent No. 1 on such invocation of the bank guarantee\nare the questions which were agitated in a writ\npetition. It is a matter either of arbitration as\nprovided by the contract or for the civil court or any\nother appropriate forum to decide these questions.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8128\" id=\"span_7\">18. It cannot be denied that the normal remedy for\nenforcing a right for payment under the private contract\nlike the bank guarantees in question from the State or\nfrom the instrumentality of the State was by filing a\ncivil suit in the civil court. The full Bench of the\nKerala High Court in <a href=\"/doc/8128/\" id=\"a_21\">Geetha Timbers v. State of Kerala</a>\n1990(1) KLT 402 made the following observation:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> &quot;This Court has held time and again that\nin contractual matters writ petition will\nnot normally be entertained. For\nenforcement of contractual rights parties\nshould avail remedies by way of civil\nsuit and should not invoke the\nextraordinary jurisdiction available\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1019781\" id=\"span_8\">19. The counsel for the petitioner has argued that\nwhere the instrumentality of the State has refused to\nact in accordance with the contract the court has ample\npower to exercise its discretion vested by <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 226</a>,\nand issue mandamus. He relied upon the judgment of this\ncourt in <a href=\"/doc/1019781/\" id=\"a_24\">Access Maritime Corporation</a> (Supra) in which a\ndispute relating to the invocation of the bank guarantee\nwas raised in a civil writ and the court had allowed the\nwrit petition and directed the bank to encash the bank\nguarantee. It was observed as under:-</span>\n</p>\n  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;Respondent No. 1 Bank accepted the\ninvocation of Bank guarantee and\nresponded to the communication of the\npetitioner by stating in letter dated 8th\nOctober, 1997 that the claim was under\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">process. Thereafter on 10 October, 1997\nthe Bank was willing to remit the amount\nof US $ 15,700/- but completely changed\nits stand and outright rejected the claim\nof the petitioner by communication dated\n18th November, 1997. This is clearly a\nmalafide approach as the respondent bank\nobviously acted on the initiative of\nrespondent No. 2 by declining to honour\nthe bank guarantee which it had no\njurisdiction in law to do. The\nrespondents were also aware of the\njudgment of this Court in IA No. 10449/97\nin Suit No. 2262/97 dated 4th November,\n1997 wherein the conduct of the\nrespondent bank was criticised. The\nrespondent could not in law refuse to\nhonour the statutory obligations and\ndeprive the petitioner of its right to\ninvoke the bank guarantee on the basis of\nthe settled law by the Supreme Court\nwhich has already been referred to. The\nplea that the order passed by this Court\non the original side was not reacquired to\nbe implemented and the petitioner was at\nliberty to take recourse to any other\nproceedings such as a suit to recover the\namount is clearly misconceived and an\nabuse of the process of Court. The\nrespondents having voluntarily invited a\ndecision from this Court could not\nsubsequently resile from the same and\nargue that the present petition is not\nmaintainable.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">Respondent No. 1 is a Nationalised Bank\nand is an instrumentality of State and,\ntherefore, amenable to writ jurisdiction.\nThe conduct and functioning of the Bank\nwhich is a nationalised Institution must\nbe above board and in public interest.\nThe facts of the case will establish that\nthe respondent bank refused to accept the\njudgment of this Court and acted in\ncollusion with respondent No. 2. The\nconduct is reprehensible and cannot be\nappreciated.\n</blockquote>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">20. The observations as reproduced above clearly show\nthat the court had exercised extraordinary jurisdiction\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226</a> in the cited case in the peculiar\nfacts and circumstances of the case. It found that the\nrespondent had refused to honour the statutory\nobligations and wanted to derive the petitioner to file a\ncivil suit refusing to implement an order passed by the\ncourt in the civil suit which the court considered to be\na clear malafide action on the part of the bank. The\ncourt also found that the bank, which was an\ninstrumentality of the State, had refused to accept the\njudgment of the High Court and had acted in collusion\nwith the respondent at whose instance the bank\nguarantees were given and the conduct of the bank was\nreprehensible and not appreciable. Thus the court found\nit to be fit and proper to invoke this power under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 226</a> and grant appropriate writ for payment of\nthe bank guarantees. The facts of the case in hand\nturns on their distinguished facts. Here the earlier\ninvocation of the bank guarantees by letter dated\n15.3.1995 was held to be not in terms of the bank\nguarantee. So an interlocutory injunction was granted\nrestraining the respondent No. 1 bank from making the\npayment due under the bank guarantee to the petitioner.\nThis order was upheld in the appeal and was not even\ndisturbed in the SLP. The additional ground on which\nthe SLP was dismissed was that in the meantime the\npetitioner had served another letter dated 15.11.2000\ninvoking the bank guarantees and demanding the money due\nunder them from the respondent No. 1. Therefore, the\nproper remedy for the petitioner to claim money under\nthe bank guarantee from the respondent and the latter&#x27;s\nrefusing to honour the letter of invocation was by way\nof a civil suit or any other proceeding before a civil\ncourt or any other appropriate forum. It could not have\ncome to the court against the decision of the respondent\nNo. 1 refusing to pay in a civil writ. The view taken by\nthis court is fortified by the law enunciated by the\nSupreme Court in the above cited judgments.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1358508\" id=\"span_9\">21. The petitioner&#x27;s reliance on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1358508/\" id=\"a_27\">J.S. Parihar v. Ganpat Duggar and\nOrs.</a>  is misplaced. The Supreme Court\nwas dealing with a contempt petition. The Government\nhad prepared the seniority list of the engineers in\nRajasthan Civil Engineering Services (Public Health\nBranch). A Division Bench of the High Court declared\nthe said seniority list prepared with retrospective\neffect in terms of the amended Rules as unconstitutional\nand accordingly it quashed the list and directed\npreparation of the seniority list afresh to determine\nthe inter se seniority on that basis and to grant\npromotion to the appellants within a specified time.\nThe seniority list was prepared. Thereafter contempt\nproceedings were initiated. The learned Single Judge\nheld that the respondents had not willfully disobeyed the\norder of the court and gave certain directions. On\nthese facts the Supreme Court observed that once there\nwas an order passed on the basis of the directions\nissued by the court, there arises a fresh cause of\naction to seek redressal in an appropriate forum. It\nwas further observed that the preparation of the\nseniority list may be wrong or may be right or may or\nmay not be in conformity with the directions but what\nwould be a fresh cause of action for the aggrieved party\nto avail of the opportunity of judicial review and that\nwould not be a willful violation of the order of the\ncourt. The facts of the case in hand are dis-similar.\nThe question here is whether the petitioner could seek\nwrit of mandamus from this court directing respondent\nNo. 1 to pay the money due under the bank guarantees.\nThe judgment, therefore, does not advance the argument\nof the counsel for petitioner that such a writ would be\nmaintainable before the court even if his contention\nthat the fresh invocation letter dated 15.11.2000 has\ngiven rise to a new cause of action to the petition is\nupheld.</span>\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"8128\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"359221\" id=\"span_11\">22. The counsel for respondent No. 1 also referred to\n<a href=\"/doc/359221/\" id=\"a_28\">Mrs. Sheela Thomas and Ors.</a> (supra) where a Division\nBench of the Kerala High Court relied upon the judgment\nof the full Bench of the same court in <a href=\"/doc/8128/\" id=\"a_29\">Geetha Timbers</a>\n(supra) and held that the normal remedy for obtaining\nrefund of excess or unauthorised collection of amounts\nfrom a person by the State or by the instrumentality of\nthe State, was by filing a suit in the civil court and\nthe appellant should, if at all, pursue the normal\nremedy open to them in a civil court. This judgment do\nsupport the case of the respondent that the civil writ\nis not the proper remedy for challenging the order of\nrespondent No. 1 impugned in this petition.</span></span>\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">23. The court, as such, could not exercise this\nextraordinary discretionary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_30\">Article\n226</a> of the Constitution of India if an alternative\nefficacious remedy is available for redressing the\ngrievance before a Civil Court or arbitral Tribunal or\nany other forum.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">24. Moreover, in the instant case a Civil Court by\nway of interlocutory injunction order passed in a civil\nsuit litigated between the parties restrained respondent\nNo. 1 bank encashing the bank guarantees in question\nand remitting the money under it to the petitioner but\nhas directed respondent No. 1 to keep the bank guarantees\nalive during the pendency of the arbitral proceeding.\nThe Supreme Court had dismissed the SLP on merit. It\nmeans that the interim injunction order granted by this\ncourt in the civil proceeding is still in operation.\nThe Supreme Court did give additional reason for\ndismissing the SLP against the order of the Division\nBench of this court that a fresh invocation letter has\nbeen issued by the petitioner demanding money under the\nbank guarantees. But the fact remains that respondent\nNo. 1 is still bound to obey the order passed by this\ncourt in exercise of its ordinary civil jurisdiction\nuntil it is recalled or modified. Any order, direction\nor writ issued in this petition to respondent No. 1\ncommanding it to pay money under the bank guarantees\nwould be in direct conflict with that order. This court\nshould not exercise its discretionary jurisdiction to\nenable a party to dis-obey the order of a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction. It was open to the petitioner\nor respondent No. 1 to have approached the concerned\nCivil Court for appropriate direction in the light of\nthe issue of fresh invocation letter and the order of\nthe Supreme Court in the SLP. It has not been done.\nFor this reason also it will not be appropriate for this\ncourt under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to\nintervene and issue a writ of mandamus in the peculiar\nfacts and circumstances of this case.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">25. For the reasons stated above there is no escape\nfrom holding that the extraordinary discretionary\njurisdiction cannot be exercised by this court in\ngranting any relief to the petitioner in this case.\n</p>\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">The result of the above discussion is that the\npetition has no merit. It is dismissed. In the facts\nand circumstances of the case the parties are left to\nbear their own cost.\n</p>\n \n\n","numcites":12,"numcitedby":2,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":1816282,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"no interim injunction","formInput":"no%20interim%20injunction"},{"value":"seniority","formInput":"seniority"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"ad interim injunction","formInput":"ad%20interim%20injunction"},{"value":"ad-interim injunction","formInput":"ad-interim%20injunction"},{"value":"ircon","formInput":"ircon"},{"value":"bank guarantee ","formInput":"bank%20guarantee%20"},{"value":"encashing of bank guarantees","formInput":"encashing%20of%20bank%20guarantees"},{"value":"mandamus","formInput":"mandamus"},{"value":"\"seniority list\"","formInput":"%22seniority%20list%22"},{"value":"slp","formInput":"slp"},{"value":"Instrumentality of state","formInput":"Instrumentality%20of%20state"},{"value":"injunction order","formInput":"injunction%20order"},{"value":"punjab  national bank","formInput":"punjab%20%20national%20bank"},{"value":"seniority list","formInput":"seniority%20list"},{"value":"interlocutory injunction","formInput":"interlocutory%20injunction"},{"value":"private contracts","formInput":"private%20contracts"},{"value":"bank guarantees","formInput":"bank%20guarantees"},{"value":"preliminary objection","formInput":"preliminary%20objection"},{"value":"guarantee","formInput":"guarantee"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"contract","formInput":"tag:contract"}],"courtcopy":false,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
