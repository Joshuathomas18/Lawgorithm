Suffice to state the appellant filed writ petition in\n\nW.P.No.31261/2016,        calling   in    question     the    order   dated\n\n18.02.2016,     passed   by   Principal   Labour     Court,   Bengaluru    in\n\nReference No.14/2012, whereby the Labour Court allowed the\n\nreference directing the appellant-management to reinstate all the\n\nfirst party - workmen / respondents herein, to their original post\n\nand the said exercise shall be done within one month from the date\n\nof publication of the award. However, the claim for backwages by\n\nthe first party - workmen was declined. The respondents-workmen\n\nalso filed Writ Petition No.57652/2017, seeking to quash / modify\n\nthe order of the Labour Court, so far as declining the backwages\n\nand sought for grant of full backwages through a writ of mandamus.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     3.      Shorn of succinctly stated facts of the case are as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     The appellant is a partnership firm established in 1974, which\n\nis   a     small-scale   industry   manufacturing        moulded      plastic\n\ncomponents. There are about 40 permanent workers employed on\n\nthe rolls of the appellant. Workers of several firms including the\n\nappellant are members of a Union called Hind Mazdoor Sabha,\n\nrecognized by the appellant management since 03.02.1988 entered\n\nseveral settlement with the said Union and the latest settlement was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      5</span>\n\n\n\ndated 17.04.2019 and was signed by the appellant firm with the\n\nsaid sole recognized Union by the appellant partnership firm.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">        4.   As there was a shortfall of few unskilled workers, the\n\nappellant    engaged    the    service    of   M/s.Madhu   Enterprises,    a\n\ncontractor who deployed around 16 workers to carry out the work,\n\nwhich were basically unskilled in nature. Accordingly, an agreement\n\nwas entered with the appellant and M/s.Madhu Enterprises as per\n\nExhibits-M7 and M8.           As there was a demand by M/s.Madhu\n\nEnterprises for enhancement of wages to the labourers supplied by\n\nit through a letter dated 14.02.2011 to the appellant, the same was\n\nfound excessive by the appellant-management, in view of the same,\n\nthe contract between the M/s.Madhu Enterprises and appellant\n\ncame to be terminated by a letter dated 18.04.2018.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">        5.   The appellant - management, received a notice from the\n\nConciliator under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_1\">Section-10</a> of Industrial Dispute Act, 1947, on the\n\ndispute raised by the respondent - first party - workmen. The\n\nappellant-management appeared before the Conciliation Officer and\n\nfiled   documents,     denying    that,   first   party-workmen   are     its\n\nemployees; that they were engaged through contractor and there is\n\nno relationship of employer-employee as such the dispute raised is\n\nnot sustainable in law. The specific case before the Conciliation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      6</span>\n\n\n\nOfficer was that first party-workmen are workers of M/s.Madhu\n\nEnterprises and if there is any dispute it should be between the\n\nM/s.Madhu Enterprises on the one hand, and the first party -\n\nworkmen on the other hand. On the failure of conciliation, a\n\nreference was made by the Government to the Labour Court under\n\nReference No.14/2012 raising the following three points for dispute:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     1. &quot;Whether the Management of M/s Leotech, No. 70, 2nd\n          Main Road, Industrial Town, Rajajinagar, Bengaluru\n          prove that the Applicants viz. Sri. Vijaykumar and four\n          others C/o Karnataka Workers Union [R], V.G. Gopal\n          Building, No. 20/1, Lalbagh Fort Road, Bengaluru 560\n          004 are the workmen of M/s Madhu Enterprises, No.\n          199, West Park Road, between 15th and 16th cross,\n          Malleshwaram West, Bengaluru 560 055?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     2. If not, whether the management of M/s Leotech, No. 70,\n          2nd Main Road, Industrial Town, Rajajinagar, Bengaluru\n          is justified in refusing work to Sri. Vijayakumar and four\n          others?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     3. If not to what relief the applicant and other four others are\n          eligible?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">     6.      Pursuant to the notice issued by the Labour Court, the\n\nfirst party - workmen filed a claim petition contending that they are\n\nthe direct employees under the appellant, they have been abruptly\n\nand arbitrarily terminated from their service w.e.f. 19.04.2011,\n\nwithout their being any misconduct on their part, which tantamount\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                   7</span>\n\n\n\nto retrenchment under <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_2\">Section-2(oo)(bb)</a> of the ID Act 1947; the\n\nmanagement has not complied with the mandatory requirements\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_3\">Section-25-F</a> of ID Act&#x27; 1947, which are conditions\n\nprescribed and as such, the termination is illegal and not sustainable\n\nunder law and accordingly they sought reinstatement of the their\n\nservices with full backwages. It is the specific contention of the\n\nworkmen that they are not workers of M/s.Madhu Enterprises and\n\nthey are directly employed by the appellant-management. It is\n\ngermane to state that, it was not at all the case of the respondents\n\nbefore Labour Court that though they have been employed through\n\na contractor under M/s.Madhu Enterprises, it is camouflage only to\n\ndecline the statutory benefits, under the beneficial provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_4\">ID Act</a>, which are enacted for the benefit of the labourers.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">     7.    The   appellant-management      appeared   and     filed   its\n\ncounter statement denying the entire case put forth by the first\n\nparty workmen / respondents. The appellant has taken a specific\n\ncontention that they are unskilled labourers engaged through the\n\nlabour contractor M/s.Madhu Enterprises as such, there is no jural\n\nrelationship of employer and employee, the reference is not\n\nmaintainable and liable to be dismissed. The labour court after\n\ncompletion of the pleadings, framed two more additional ancillary\n\nissues, which reads as under:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;ADDL. ISSUES:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      1.   Whether   the   first   party   proves   the   existence   of\n\n      employer and employee relationship between themselves?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      2.   Whether the second party justified the alleged action of\n\n      refusing work to the said first party 5 workmen?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">     8.    The appellant-management examined one of the partner\n\nof M/s.Madhu Enterprises as MW-1 and one of the partner of the\n\nappellant-management as MW-2 and produced totally 72 documents\n\nin their support and marked the same as Exhibit-M1 to Exhibit-M72\n\nand closed its side. On behalf of the workmen all the five workmen,\n\nwere examined WW-1 to WW-5, however, they have not produced\n\nany document.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">     9.    The Labour Court after hearing the parties before it,\n\nallowed the reference directing the management to reinstate the\n\nfirst party-workmen to their original position within a period of 30\n\ndays from the date of publication of the Award. However, the full\n\nbackwages claimed by the respondents-workmen was declined. The\n\nreasons in the judgment passed by the Labour Court are contained\n\nat paragraph Nos.16 to 24, which reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     &quot;16. The learned counsel for the first party rightly brought\n     to the notice of the Court with regard to the preamble\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                       9</span>\n\n\nincorporated at the time of issuance of license to Madhu\nEnterprises found place at Ex.M7 and M8. The very\npreamble       goes   to    show      that      M/s    Leo      Tech   is   a\nmanufacturing unit wherein they manufacture moulds, jigs\nand fixtures and whereas they were interested in engaging\ncontract      employees     to   do       filling,   loading,    unloading,\ncleaning etc., and Madhu Enterprises was interested in the\nsame as they had unskilled man power to carryout this kind\nof    work.    Therefore,    both         the    parties     entered    into\nagreement giving effect from 1.4.2006 on the following\nterms and conditions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">1. The first party will give to the second party schedule of\n     work in such conditions and specification from time to\n     time personally and the second party shall carry out\n     such assignments diligently and as per schedule.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">2. The party of the second part shall be solely responsible\n     for the payment of wages and benefits accruing to the\n     workmen engaged by him and he shall also ensure the\n     adherence to all statutory requirements like Contract\n     Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, Employees State\n     Insurance Act, Employees Provident Funds Act, Payment\n     of Bonus Act, and if liable, he will accordingly take\n     license under the said Acts and Rules.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">3. The party of the first part shall have no liability on the\n     workmen engaged by the party of the second part and\n     the workmen so engaged by the party of the second\n     part have no right to claim permanency of employment\n     with the party of the first part.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                             10</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">4. The party of the second part shall ensure good\n  behavior, conduct and application and discipline of\n  workmen engaged by him. He shall ensure adherence to\n  all rules and regulations under any statutory liabilities\n  covering the workmen.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">5. The party of the second part agrees to employ persons\n  only to the required number from time to time, fix those\n  wages and be responsible to pay minimum wages,\n  bonus, ESI &amp; EPF., contributions if any when statutorily\n  required, leave, if any, and other legal claim to his\n  labour and staff employed by him.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">6. The party of the second part shall instruct their\n  employees to be responsible for the prompt and due\n  execution, in good condition of the jobs given to him by\n  the party of the first part. The party of the second part\n  wholly be responsible for the manner the work should\n  be performed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">7. The party of the second part will be solely responsible\n  for the materials turned over to him by the first party\n  till such time the materials are returned to the first\n  party.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">8. The party of the second part hereby agrees that eh shall\n  submit his register under the C.L.Act as and when called\n  for also agrees that he will not use any other premises\n  of the first party except agreed hereunto and will not\n  interfere with any other work or working process of the\n  first party.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                11</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\"> 9. It is agreed that the employees of the second part will\n    maintain absolute secrecy about assignment given by\n    the first part and shall not the reveal to third party any\n    information     that   they     come     across     during\n    employment/deputation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">10. It is agreed by the second party that he will submit bills\n    to the first party on the 30th of every month as per the\n    agreed terms and conditions and the first party hereby\n    agreed to pay the same on or before the next working\n    day of the month, subject to scrutiny.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">11. It is agreed by the first party that he shall be paying all\n    the statutory dues and also the services charges for the\n    second party.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">12. It shall be open to either party to terminate this\n    agreement by giving one months notice in advance to\n    the party and make alternate arrangement in the event\n    of failure to comply with all conditions laid out in this\n    agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">13. Matters not specified traversed in this agreement shall\n    be dealt by mutual discussion and decided and any\n    dispute arising between the parties above named either,\n    in matters relating to this contract work shall be dealt\n    with by Indian Arbitration Act. All disputes shall be\n    decided at Bangalore Jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">14. It is further agreed by the rp that the wages specified\n    will be for 8 hours of work per day and over and above\n    8 hours and on the days of holidays if the workers are\n    required to work, the first party would pay the second\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                12</span>\n\n\n   party an extra amount of overtime wages in accordance\n   with the <a href=\"/doc/1955064/\" id=\"a_5\">Factories Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">    17. So also the agreement entered into between M/s\nLeo Tech Unit and M/s Madhu Enterprises as per Ex.M8 is\nto the effect that M/s Leo Tech Unit II is a manufacturing\nunit wherein they manufacture Moulds, Jigs and Fixtures.\nWhereas   they   were    interested    in   engaging    contract\nemployees to do filling, loading, unloading, cleaning etc.,\nand the second party was interested in the same as they\nhad un skilled man power to carry out these kind of work.\nThis preamble is contrary to the nature of work carried out\nby the first party workmen as rightly brought to the notice\nof the Court by the learned counsel for the first party\nworkmen with reference to the cross-examination of M.W.2\nat paragraph no.23 which reads thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">    &quot;It is true to suggest that the concerned workmen\n    worked in the production unit and the target was fixed\n    for their work. There was an agreement between\n    Mahadevegowda       with   II   party   for   supplying   the\n    contract labourers. I have produced the concerned\n    documents, which is at Ex.M7 and 8. I requested\n    Mahadevegowda to supply the labourers a for unskilled\n    work. I did not request in writing as to how many\n    contract labourers required to me. The previety of\n    contract between II party and Mahadevgowda was in\n    the year 2006. It is not true to suggest that the\n    concerned workmen were working under the II party\n    even prior to 2006. I do not know as to whether\n    workman name called Murali was worked under II\n    party from the year 2002 I do not know, as to whether\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                              13</span>\n\n\n    the workman name called Murali was worked under II\n    party from the year 2002. I do not know as to whether\n    the concerned workmen were worked in II party from\n    the year 2004.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">    18. So also in paragraph No.24 M.W.2 has deposed\nthat:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">        &quot;To file counter statement I appraised the facts to\n    my counsel. I did not challenge the order passed by\n    the Government for referring the matter to this Court.\n    It is not true to suggest the II party directly appointed\n    the concerned workmen: It is true to suggest II party\n    supervised the work of the concerned workmen, so\n    also by the contractors. From the contractor side\n    supervisor supervised the work of the concerned\n    workmen, but I do not know the name of the said\n    supervisor. It is not true to suggest none of the\n    supervisor from the contractor side supervised the\n    work of the concerned workmen. It is not true to\n    suggest II party paid the wages of the concerned\n    workmen. Some of the workmen are permanently\n    working with the II party, who are other then the I\n    party workmen.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">    19. The learned counsel for the first party also drawn\nmy attention to paragraph No.27 and 28 i.е., cross-\nexamination of M.W.2 which reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">        &quot;27. In the month of April 2011 we were given\n    work to the Madhu Enterprises with regard to loading\n    and unloading and also the helper job to its workmen.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               14</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">    The said work still in the II party as it is an industry\n    Now the said work is attending by our workmen.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">         28. It is not true to suggest I am deposing falsely\n    stating that II party terminate the work of the\n    workmen in the Madhu Enterprises. The contract\n    labourers demanded the higher wages for which we\n    denied. Hence, we terminate them. It is not true to\n    suggest there was no any privity of contract between\n    the Madhu Enterprises with the II party. It is not true\n    to suggest the concerned workmen demanded the\n    higher wages for which we denied.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">    20. Referring to the above paragraphs he submits that\nall the first party workmen were working under the second\nparty production unit, supervised by the second party.\nFurther the agreement was with regard to the loading,\nunloading filling, cleaning etc, and also helper job to its\nregular workmen was entered into between the second\nparty with Madhu Enterprises. Under such circumstances\nthe decisions cited by the learned counsel for the second\nparty to test the employee and employer relationship as\nper the decision reported in 2004(3) SCC 514 will not come\nto their aid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">    21. The first party workmen proved the workman ship\nwith reference to the decision cited supra particularly the\ndecision reported in AIR 1978 SC 1410, LLR 2011 SC 1079,\nLLR 1999 SC 433, 1994 LLR 634 SC, AIR 1970 SC 823\nwhich definitely come to the aid of the first party. Hence, in\nthe light of decision cited supra by the learned counsel for\nthe first party and also on scrutinizing the evidence on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                               15</span>\n\n\nrecord, I come to the conclusion that the first party\nworkmen have proved that they are the workmen working\nunder the second party le., Leotech and the first party also\nproved that there exists the relationship of master and\nservant between them with the second party. Hence, I\nanswer this reference issue No.1 in the negative and Addl.\nIssue No.1 in the affirmative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">    22. REFERRED ISSUE NO.2 AND ADDL.ISSUE\nNO.2: Since these two issues are interconnected with\nregard to the workmanship. Hence, they are taken together\nfor discussion just to avoid repetition of facts. Referred\nIssue No.2 is with regard to the refusal of employment and\nAddl. Issue No.2 is with regard to whether the second party\njustified the alleged acts of refusal of employment to all the\nfirst party workmen While recording my findings on Issue\nNo.1 and Addl. issue No. 1, I have categorically discussed\nwith regard to the relationship between the first party\nworkmen with the second party management as employee\nand employer. Now this Court will have to find out as to\nwhether the second party management rightly refused\nemployment to all the first party workmen. What are the\nreasons for refusal of employment is culled out from the\nmouth of one of the management witnesses examined as\nM.W.2 viz., K.Divakarn who in his cross-examination at\nparagraph No.28 has deposed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">    &quot;...................The contract labourers demanded the\nhigher wages for which we denied. Hence, we\nterminate them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">                                   (Emphasis supplied.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                       16</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">    23. So, this is the main reason for termination of the\nservices   of    all   the    first    party   workmen      from    the\nemployment of the second party management. Further as\nto know whether all the first party workmen being the\npermanent workers of the second party is concerned, the\nlearned counsel for the first party drawn my attention to\nthe cross-examination of M.W.2 which is in paragraph\nNo.29 who in his cross-examination deposed as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">    &quot;I came to know that the I party workmen raised the\ndispute before the Labour Department&quot; Further admission\nof M.W.2 with regard to the service of all the first party\nworkmen with the second party management from the date\nof engaging Madhu Enterprises is taken into consideration,\ntheir service was more than 240 days. So, the evidence of\nM.W.2 rebound to the contentions taken by the second\nparty management to the effect that agreement entered\ninto between the second part management with the Madhu\nEnterprises was with regard to loading, unloading and\nhelper to the permanent workers of the second party\nmanagement. When the very agreement entered into\nbetween the second party and Madhu Enterprises goes to\nshow that the          workmen were taken to do loading,\nunloading and also to work as helpers to the permanent\nemployees of the second party management. But the work\nassigned to all the first party workmen is as that of the\npermanent       workers      working       under   the   second    party\nmanagement. The only intention in terminating the services\nof the first party was with regard to demanding higher\nwages.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    17</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">      24. An attempt has been made by the second party\n     placing reliance on the attendance register and also wage\n     register. As already stated above, the work done by all the\n     first party workmen under the second party management is\n     permanent in nature and the very document maintained by\n     the Madhu Enterprises are nothing but to benefit the\n     second party management by adopting unfair labour\n     practice. It is very interesting to note down that the second\n     party management examined one Mahadevegowda as\n     M.W.1 who is the partner of M/s Madhu Enterprises and\n     and he gave evidence in favour of the second party. This\n     goes to show that he is interested in helping the second\n     party management for the reason best known to him.\n     Hence, I come to the conclusion that the first party\n     workmen      satisfactorily proved   that    the   second     party\n     management refused employment to them and the second\n     party management did not justify in dismissing all the first\n     party workmen from its employment. Accordingly said\n     issues are answered.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">     10.

The learned Single Judge by his order dated 10.04.2023\n\ndismissed both the petitions and confirmed the order passed by the\n\nLabour Court. The learned Single Judge framed four points for\n\nconsideration, and answered the same in paragraph nos.11 to 15.2,\n\nwhich reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">     &quot;11.

Whether the labour Court would be justified to examine\n     whether a labour contract is a sham or camouflage in all\n     cases where a reference is made as regards termination of\n     services of contract labour, or would the labour Court be\n     restricted by the terms of reference and be ineligible to\n     examine the genuineness or the validity of a labour contract?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">     2.    In the event of the labour contract being held to be a\n     sham and camouflage, would the workmen, as a matter of\n     right be entitled to reinstatement, continuity of service, and\n     consequent benefits, including full back wages?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     3.    Whether the award passed by the labour Court suffers\n     from any legal infirmity requiring interference at the hands of\n     this Court?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">     4.    What Order?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">     12. I answer the above points as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">     13. ANSWER TO POINT NO.1: Whether the labour Court\n     would be justified to examine whether a labour contract is a\n     sham or camouflage in all cases where a reference is made\n     as regards termination of services of contract labour, or\n     would the labour Court be restricted by the terms of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                  19</span>\n\n\nreference and be ineligible to examine the genuineness or the\nvalidity of a labour contract?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n13.1. The contention of Sri.K.R.Anand, learned counsel for the\nemployer is that the Labour Court has travelled beyond the\nreference. Unless there being any reference made as regards\nwhether the agreement entered into between the employer\nand the contractor being a sham transaction, the Labour\nCourt could not have ventured into this aspect and pronounce\non the same, which could not have been done and therefore,\nis contrary to the Judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the\ncases    of   Oshiar      Prasad,     Sindhu     Resettlement\nCorporation Limited, Jaipur Udyog Ltd and Delhi Cloth\nand General Mills co. Ltd.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">13.2. In the present matter, the employer claims that the\nworkers were engaged by and were employees of the\ncontractor, whereas the workers claim that though they were\nemployees of the contractor, they were under the day-to-day\nsupervision and instructions of the employer and as such, the\ncontractor was not their employer. The employer had made\nuse of the methodology of appointing a contractor to reduce\nits financial burden inasmuch as the employer is paying\nRs.76/- per day to the workmen on its rolls, whereas Rs.56/-\nis paid insofar as the contract employees were concerned.\nThis amount of Rs.56/- per day is inclusive of the amounts\npayable to the contractor, it is in that background that upon\nthe termination of the contract of the contractor resulted in\nthe denial of employment to the workers engaged through the\ncontractor that a dispute was raised which went through\nconciliation and failed and thereafter referred to the industrial\ntribunal by the appropriate government.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                20</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n13.3. It is that background that it is required to be considered\nby this Court while answering the above question. The\nreference being made as regards a few of the workmen, the\nappropriate government referred the matter on the points of\nreference viz., whether the refusal of employment to the\nworkmen was proper or not? What is the compensation to be\npaid to such workmen? The main question which had been\nreferred to was whether the workmen were to establish that\nthey were employed by the employer?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">13.4. What is not in dispute is that the workmen were\nengaged by the contractor, in furtherance of which the\nworkmen were discharging their duties at the factory of the\nemployer. The only question is whether the workmen were\ndirectly working with the employer or for the contractor?\n\n13.5. The evidence on record which has been dealt with by\nthe labour Court categorically indicates that the instructions\nwere being issued by the employer, the targets were set by\nthe employer and it is only the supply of labour which was\nmade by the contractor to the employer. The aspect of\ndetermining whether the workmen were employees of the\nemployer or that of the contractor would therefore require\nexamination of the contract between the employer and the\ncontractor in order to come to a decision on the above point.\nThus, unless the contract is one which cannot be said to be\nsham or camouflage, the workmen would continue to be\nthose engaged by the contractor and not by the employer.\nHowever, if the contract is said to be sham and camouflage a\nconclusion could be arrived at that the workmen were\nemployees of the employer. Thus this aspect of whether the\ncontract was sham and camouflage is in my considered\nopinion an integral part of the question to determine whether\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                 21</span>\n\n\nthe aggrieved workmen were the direct employees of the\nemployer or the contractor. Thus, the decision relied upon by\nSri.K.R.Anand in Sindhu Resettlement Corpn. Ltd&#x27;s case\n(supra6) that unless the issue was specifically raised before\nthe government and the government referred the same to the\nIndustrial Tribunal, the Tribunal cannot advert to the same\nwould not be applicable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">13.6. Similarly, the decisions in Jaipur Udyog Ltd. (supra7),\nDelhi Cloth &amp; General Mills Co. Ltd. (supra8), which have\nbeen pressed into service to contend that the present workers\nbeing the workmen employed by contractor, those workmen\ncould not raise the dispute against the present employer are\nnot applicable since the contract is a sham and camouflage.\nThe decision in Oshiar Prasad&#x27;s case (supra¹) relied upon\nby   Sri.K.R.Anand   that   a   labour   contract   having   been\nterminated, the workmen could not seek for regularization\nwould also not be applicable since the very termination of the\ncontract appears to be for the purpose of getting rid of the\ncontract labour who have been working in perennial jobs for a\nlong time with the employer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">13.7. The decision in Mahendra Prasad Jakhmola&#x27;s case\n(supra2) relied upon by the learned counsel to contend that\nmere supervision would not make a contract worker, a worker\nof the employer is not applicable for the reason that in the\npresent case, it is not just supervision, but also allotment of\nwork fixing of targets for each of the contract workmen was\nmade by the employer. Whether the salary is paid directly by\nthe principal employer to the workmen or through contractor,\nin my considered opinion, would not make much of a\ndifference if the engagement of the workmen is made through\na contractor as a camouflage. It is only when a contractor has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 22</span>\n\n\nbeen hired who in turn deputes workmen for a specific period\nof time to conduct non-perennial work, that the decision in\nBharatlals&#x27; case (supra4) relied upon by Sri.K.R.Anand\nwould be applicable and not in a situation where a workmen\nhaving been engaged for a long period of time though a\ncontractor to provide services for the employer.\n\n13.8. The last contention of Sri.K.R.Anand in this regard is\nthat so long as the contract labour is permitted and there is\nno embargo under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA, any employer can\nmake use of contract labour and that labour cannot seek for\nregularization   is   also   in my   considered opinion   not   a\nproposition to be applied to the present case.\n\n13.9. The engagement of contract labour being permitted\nmerely on account of no prohibition under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 10</a> of CLRA\nbeing made would not entitle an employer to use the said\nprocess for its own benefit in reducing its burden and or\ndepriving the workmen of their just wages. In the event of a\nnotification under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 10</a> being issued, it is very clear that\nno contract labour could be used. If any workmen are\nengaged through a contractor then they would get the\npreference for being considered for appointment as and when\nthere is a vacancy which arises. Even otherwise, though no\nnotification under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 10</a> is issued if the employer were to\nterminate a contract with a contractor and the employer were\nto engage new labour, it would be the duty of the employer to\nprovide employment to those workmen as and when vacancy\narises, as also for the employer not to engage any other\nworkmen other than the contract workers for the said post\nwithout offering the same to the contract workers. Thus,\nwhether a notification is issued under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 10</a> of CLRA or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                23</span>\n\n\nnot, the right of the workmen to raise industrial dispute of\nthey being denied work would still continue.\n\n13.10. The Judgments relied upon by Sri.A.J.Srinivasan in the\ncase of National Union Waterfront Workers (supra10) and\nVinod   Kumar        Sharma   (supra¹¹)   would   be   applicable\ninasmuch as if the contract is found to be not genuine but a\nmere camouflage, the so-called contract labour will have to\nbe treated as employees of the principal employer and this\ndetermination would be a preliminary determination for the\npurpose of adjudicating the dispute between the principal\nemployer and the workmen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">13.11. Considering the above, I answer point No.1 by holding\nthat the labour Court would be justified to examine whether\nthe labour contract is a sham and camouflage in all cases\nwhere references are made as regards termination of service\nof contract labour since this would be a preliminary question\nto be answered before examining whether the termination is\nproper or not, whether the denial of work is proper or not and\nthereafter to examine whether the workmen have to be\nreinstated or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">14. ANSWER TO POINT NO.2: In the event of the labour\ncontract being held to be a sham and camouflage,\nwould the workmen, as a matter of right be entitled to\nreinstatement, continuity of service, and consequent\nbenefits, including full back wages?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">14.1. Whenever a labour contract is held to be sham and\ncamouflage, the workman who is denied work by either\ntermination of the contract with the contractor or by\ntermination of services of the workman himself, on a dispute\nbeing raised, the labour Court would have to consider\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                   24</span>\n\n\nwhether such workman would be entitled for reinstatement,\ncontinuity of service, consequential benefits including full\nbackwages or not. There is no strict rule applicable to this nor\nis a straight jacket formula applicable. These aspects would\nhave to be considered by the labour Court on merits of\nindividual cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">14.2. In the event of a labour contract being held to be sham\nand camouflage, there would be a right vested with the\nworkmen to be offered employment. In the event of the\nemployer seeking to engage any other person for the very\nsame job or engaging another contractor to deliver the same\nservices by engaging contract labour, until and unless such\naction is sought to be taken by the employer, there is no\nvested right in the workmen to be reinstated automatically.\nBut the aspect of whether the workmen would be entitled for\nreinstatement,      continuity   of    service   and   consequential\nbenefits, being dependent on the above the factual matrix\nwould have to be determined by the labour court before\nordering any of the above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">15. ANSWER TO POINT NO.3: Whether the award\npassed by the labour Court suffers from any legal\ninfirmity requiring interference at the hands of this\nCourt?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">15.1. As regards awardal of back wages, the labour Court has\nawarded 50% of the back wages and denied full back wages\nto the workmen, I am of the considered opinion that the said\norder meets ends of justice. Though the workmen were\nprevented from discharging their work on account of the\nstand taken by the employer, the fact remains that the\nworkmen have not carried out any work for the employer and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   25</span>\n\n\n     the employer has not derived any benefits from the said\n     workers. Thus, awardal of 50% back wages, in my considered\n     opinion, would in the present case serve the interest of\n     justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">     15.2. In view of my answer to Points NO.1 and 2, the labour\n     Court having rightly come to a conclusion that the labour\n     contract entered into to reduce the burden of the employer,\n     the workmen being supervised by the employer, the targets\n     being set by the employer, the workmen reporting to the\n     employer rather than the contractor having been taken into\n     consideration by the labour Court in a proper perspective, I\n     am of the considered opinion that the said order does not\n     suffer from any legal infirmity requiring interference at the\n     hands of this Court.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">     12.

Perused the records and orders impugned in this appeal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">     14.   The main limb of argument of Sri.K.Kasturi, learned\n\nSenior Counsel is that, there is no jural relationship of employer and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                       26</span>\n\n\n\nemployee between the appellant and the respondents - workmen.\n\nThe workmen were engaged through a labour contractor by name\n\nM/s.Madhu Enterprises and the work is not perennial in nature. Out\n\nof 16 workers engaged through contract labour, 11 of them settled\n\ntheir    claims   with   the    M/s.Madhu         Enterprises.    Subsequent   to\n\ntermination of the labour agreement with the M/s.Madhu Enterprises\n\nonly 5 i.e., the respondents-workmen herein raised dispute which\n\nresulted in reference. Out of five workers, one worker by name\n\nSri.Vijayakumar      herein     settled     his     dispute      with   M/s.Madhu\n\nEnterprises on 23.07.2018 on receiving of Rs.36,000/- from his\n\nemployer.      The   said      settlement     dated      23.07.2018       between\n\nrespondent No.1 and M/s.Madhu Enterprises was also produced as\n\nAnnexure-R1 to the statement of objections filed to the writ petition\n\nfiled by the respondent-workmen challenging the part of the award\n\npassed by the labour court. This fact also throws light on the specific\n\ndefense of the appellant-management that the respondent-workmen\n\nare not employees of the appellant and there is no relationship of\n\nemployer-employees between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">        15.   The learned Senior Counsel further argues that both the\n\nlabour court and the learned Single Judge have erred in concluding\n\nthat, in the absence of pleading and proof by the respondents\n\nagainst the contract labour, which is a bedrock to hold that though\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                     27</span>\n\n\n\nthe employees were employed through contract, it is sham and\n\ncamouflaged one with the sole object to deprive the workmen the\n\nlegal rights granted under the Beneficial Acts such as ID Act, ESI\n\nAct, etc., and amounts to unfair trade practice. This according to\n\nMr.Kasturi, learned Senior Counsel, is not the requirement of\n\npleadings and law. The workmen were required to plead and prove\n\nthat the contract was actually sham and camouflaged. He stated in\n\nthe absence of pleadings, the sham and camouflage could not have\n\nbeen gone into, the labour has erred in coming to such a conclusion.\n\nTo base his argument learned Senior Counsel has taken us through\n\nthe claim petition filed by the workmen, wherein they have except\n\nstating they are employees directly employed by the appellant and\n\nthere is no relationship between them and labour contractor i.e.,\n\nM/s.Madhu Enterprises have not pleaded contract as sham and\n\ncamouflaged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">     16.

Refuting the submission of learned Senior Counsel,\n\nSri.A.J.Srinivasan learned counsel appearing for the respondents -\n\nworkmen vehemently submitted, by taking us through various\n\ndocuments to show and contend that the work for which the\n\nrespondents - workmen were engaged was in production line and\n\ntargets were fixed by the appellant, as such they are perennial in\n\nnature; that apart they are under the direct supervision of the\n\nappellant-management. The agreements at Exhibits-M7 and M8\n\nstates about the employment of unskilled workers for filling, loading\n\nand unloading, which are perennial nature of work. They were\n\nworking even prior to the contract i.e., form the year 2004 till the\n\nillegal termination. He relied on the cross-examination of MW-1 as\n\nwell as MW-2. His specific contention is MW-2 at para No.23 of his\n\nevidence has clearly admitted that the workmen worked in the\n\nProduction Unit, target was fixed for their work and the agreement\n\nentered into between the appellant and the labour contract was for\n\nsupply of unskilled labourers for filling, loading and unloading,\n\nwhereas the work assigned to them are at Production Line which\n\nwork is perennial in nature.

Having heard the learned counsel for the parties the\n\nshort issue, which arises for our consideration in this appeal is:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">       &quot;Whether the award passed by the Labour Court, as well\n\n       as the order passed by the learned Single Judge\n\n       confirming the same, by dismissing the writ petition in\n\n       the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, suffers\n\n       from errors and perversity and requires interference at\n\n       the hands of this Court?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">       20.    At the outset, it is to be noted that, all along, it is the\n\nspecific and definite contention of the respondents-workmen that\n\nthey    are    employees     directly        employed   by   the   appellant-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">management and they were never under the employment of\n\nM/s.Madhu Enterprises. Even in the claim petition filed by the\n\nworkmen, they restricted the plea. They have never stated that they\n\nwere engaged through contractor. It was their case that they were\n\nworking in Production Line and their work is perennial in nature;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">that they worked for more than 240 days and they are workers of\n\nthe appellant-management.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                    34</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">     21.    The averments by the respondents-workmen in the claim\n\npetition are very much important to throw light to hold that contract\n\nis a sham and camouflaged as observed by the learned Single Judge\n\nwhile answering point No.1. For easy reference the contents of the\n\nclaim petition from paragraph Nos.3 to 13 are extracted, to show it\n\nwas not the case of the workmen that the contract is sham and\n\ncamouflaged.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">     &quot;3.    It is submitted that the 2nd party management is\n     engaged in the manufacture of plastic hardened components\n     since many years and it making huge profits during each year\n     on account of the hard work of the workmen. It has employed\n     about 60 workmen in different capacities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">     4.    It is submitted that the 1st party concerned workmen\n     along with other workmen of the 2nd party management\n     formed a branch of Karnataka Workers Union, much against\n     to the wishes of the 2nd party management. In fact, the 2nd\n     party management and the earlier HMS leaders hand-in-glove\n     with each other was not doing any acts which are benefitted\n     to the workmen in general. It was a stood union in the hands\n     of the 2nd party management. Under such circumstances, the\n     Karnataka Workers Union was formed much against to the\n     wishes of the 2nd party management with a view to fight for\n     better benefits and to contest the unfair acts of the 2nd party\n     management. Since the 1st party concerned workmen were\n     also active members of the union, the 2nd party management\n     had developed most adamant and hostile attitude towards\n     them. In fact, the 1st party concerned workmen were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                       35</span>\n\n\ncontinuously pressurizing and persuading the 2nd party\nmanagement for Better service condition, better wages and\nconfirmation of their services on par with their colleagues who\nwere doing similar nature of jobs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">5.

The 1st party concerned workmen are the members the\nKarnataka Workers Union since beginning and they were\ntaking active role in the legal and legitimate trade union\nactivities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">7. It is submitted that all the 1st party concerned workmen\nwere discharging, permanent and perennial nature of jobs\nsince beginning, which are directly connected to production\nprocess. However, the 2nd party management was not paying\nthe statutory minimum wages as per the provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_26\">Minimum Wages Act</a> Notification. Added to this, the 2nd party\nmanagement was not paying the wages to these workmen on\npar with other permanent workmen who were doing similar\nnature of jobs. Even the various benefits also were not\ngranted on par with the permanent workmen. These 1st party\nworkmen       were     repeatedly       persuading      the   2nd       party\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                       36</span>\n\n\nmanagement for better wages and service conditions as per\nthe <a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_27\">Minimum Wages Act</a> and also on par with the other\npermanent workmen. Hence, the 2ndparty management had\ndeveloped most adamant and hostile attitude towards the 1st\nparty concerned workmen and was trying to victimize them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">8. When the facts stoodthus, to the utter shock and surprise\nof the concerned 5 workmen, the 2nd party management\nillegally refused employment to all of them with effect from\n19/4/2011 without giving any valid and justified reasons.\nImmediately, all the concerned workmen have given a written\nrepresentation    dated      21/4/2011            to     the     2nd     party\nmanagement by registered post with acknowledgment due\nrequesting for immediate reinstatement. But, the 2ndparty\nmanagement       has   failed    to    act.   Hence,       the    1st    party\nconcerned    Workmen         submitted        a    conciliation        petition\ndt.19/5/2011     to    the      jurisdictional         conciliation     officer\nrequesting his intervention in the matter. Unfortunately the\n2nd party management has taken most untenable and\nunjustified contentions before the conciliation officer that the\nsaid concerned workmen are not their direct employees and\nthey were working with the contractor M/s.Madhu Enterprises\netc. This contention of the 2ndparty management is totally\nillegal, unjust, unfair and not sustainable in law. The 1st party\nconcerned workmen were never the employees of any\ncontractor, much less, M/s Madhu Enterprises as falsely\ncontended by the 2nd party management at any point of\ntime. They were all working directly with the 2nd party\nmanagement since beginning and the said contention of the\n2nd party management is nothing but a created and\nconcocted story with a pre-determined intention to justify\ntheir illegal action of refusal of employment. The same is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                  37</span>\n\n\ncontrary to law and not sustainable in law. The 1st party\nunion has given a reply to that effect vide rejoinder dated\n26/8/2011. In fact, all the other workmen who were working\nalong with the 1st party concerned workmen are still working\nin the 2nd party management directly. All the concerned 5\nworkmen have been working directly under the 2nd party\nmanagement from the date of their employment itself and\nthey have all working continuously doing permanent nature of\njobs. Hence, it is not fair and proper on the party of the 2nd\nparty management to term them as contract workmen or\nworkmen working under contractor etc. The said conclusion of\nthe 2nd party management has no legs to stand. The 1st\nparty concerned workmen are not concerned to any such\ncontractor at any time as contended.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">9. It is submitted that the efforts of the conciliation officer did\nnot yield any results solely due to the adamant, hostile and\nnon co-operative attitude of the 2nd party management.\nHence, conciliation ended in failure.

Whereas all the\n\ndocuments produced stand against them, to show that they are on\n\nthe Muster Roll of M/s.Madhu Enterprises i.e., the contractor. Even\n\ntheir ESI and PF were paid by M/s.Madhu Enterprises, to the\n\nconcerned department under the specific individual identity number\n\nprovided by the department.

As could be seen from the records the claim of workmen\n\nframed or set up was that they were permanent employees\n\nemployed directly by the appellant.         The respondents - workmen\n\nhave not placed even a single document to show that they were\n\nworking since 2004, under the appellant-management. In their\n\nclaim petition itself especially, at paragraph No.7 they have taken\n\nseveral contentions such as the second party management was not\n\npaying the statutory minimum wages as per the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/142278/\" id=\"a_38\">Minimum Wages Act</a>, Added to this, the second party - management\n\nwas not paying wages to these workmen on par with other workmen\n\nwho were doing similar type of job. Even the benefits are not given\n\nat par with other workmen. Till 2011 they had not raised any\n\ngrievance against such discrimination before authorities. They have\n\nnot made any representation to the appellant - management. Had\n\nthere been such a situation encountered by them they would have\n\ndefinitely   made    some     representation    and   complained      to   the\n\nconcerned authority. However, nothing is forthcoming from the\n\nrecords. In these circumstances, the case put forth by the\n\nrespondents is highly unbelievable.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                            44</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">        30.    Another limb of argument put forth by the respondents -\n\nworkmen is that they are working under the supervision of the\n\nappellant. A Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in the case of The\n\nManagement of M/s Stumpp, Schule &amp; Somappa Springs Pvt.\n\nLtd.,    vs.    Mr.U.Mallikarjuna,           in   Writ    Appeal      No.1685/2018,\n\ndecided on 21.10.2024, referring to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court in paragraph No.21 has held that, even if the workmen\n\nwere working under the supervision of the appellant they shall not\n\nbecome employees of the Principal employer i.e., appellant, the\n\nsame reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">               &quot;21. It follows, the contractors were the employers of the\n        respondent. The ESI and PF contribution made by the appellant would\n        not be relevant / conclusive to hold the appellant was employer. This\n        is for the reason under the provisions of the Act of 1970, the principal\n        employer is under an obligation to ensure that ESI and PF\n        Contributions are made by the contractor; failure on the part of his\n        employer (contractor), the liability shall shift on the Principal\n        employer i.e., the appellant herein. In that regard, the finding of the\n        learned Single Judge in paragraph No.18 is contradictory and is not\n        sustainable in law. Further, the Supreme Court in the same Judgment\n        has also in paragraph No.28.3, on the working of the contract labour\n        under the supervision of the Principal employer, has stated as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">                  &quot;28.3. The next ground referred is that the contract labour\n               were working under the direct supervision and control of\n               officers of IAAI. This is not in fact disputed. The contract\n               labour were engaged in handling cargo, that is loading,\n               unloading and movement of cargo in the Cargo Complex of\n               IAAI. Naturally, the work     had to be done under the\n               supervision of the officers of IAAI. Merely because the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                               45</span>\n\n\n               contract labour work is under the supervision of the officers of\n               the principal employer, it cannot be taken as evidence of\n               direct employment under the principal employer. Clause 17 of\n               the Contract Agreement required a supervisor to be employed\n               by the society also. Exercise of some control over the\n               activities of contract labour while they discharge their duties\n               as labourers, is inevitable and such exercise is not sufficient\n               to hold that the contract labour will become the direct\n               employees of the principle employer&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">               So, it is clear that, even if the respondent was working under\n        the supervision of the appellant, he shall not become the employee of\n        the Principal employer i.e., the appellant.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144538253\" id=\"span_64\">31.     Additionally,      as    per    the     admissions      in   the   cross-\n\nexamination given by the respondents - workmen, the salary was\n\nbeing paid to them by the contractor. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the\n\ncase      of   <a href=\"/doc/144538253/\" id=\"a_39\">International           Airport       Authority        of    India   vs.\n\nInternational Air Cargo Workers Union4</a> clearly held that one of\n\nthe test to determine who is employer is as to who is paying the\n\nsalary to the workmen / claimant. At paragraph No.38, wherein the\n\nfollowing has been stated:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">        &quot;38. The tests that are applied to find out whether a person is an\n       employee or an independent contractor may not automatically apply\n       in finding out whether the contract labour agreement is a sham,\n       nominal and is a mere camouflage. For example, if the contract is\n       for supply of labour, necessarily, the labour supplied by the\n       contractor will work under the directions, supervision and control of\n       the principal employer but that would not make the workers a direct\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">4</span>\n    (2009) 13 SCC 374\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                         46</span>\n\n\n      employee of the principal employer, if the salary is paid by a\n      contractor, if the right to regulate the employment is with the\n      contractor, and the ultimate supervision and control lies with the\n      contractor.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">      32.    The judgments referred by the respondents - workmen\n\nare distinguishable on the facts of the case, as in almost all there\n\nwas a contention that, the contract between the management and\n\nthe contractor is sham and camouflage and the same has been\n\nproved. However, in the peculiar facts of this case neither there is\n\nany pleading nor any proof by placing any document to show that\n\nthe    contract      was   sham   and    camouflaged,    designed     by   the\n\nmanagement to avoid its liability towards workmen under various\n\nstatues. It is trite law that court shall not subscribe its view which is\n\nalien to the facts pleaded and proof submitted by the parties -\n\nlitigants. In the absence of any proof regarding the employment and\n\nthe    pleadings      regarding   the   contract   labour    as   sham     and\n\ncamouflaged, it becomes very hard for this Court to accept the\n\nreasons rendered by the labour court and confirmed by the learned\n\nsingle judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">      33.
