In and around 2007, the plaintiff set up a steel plant\n\n                      popularly known as “Suryadev&#x27;s Steel Plant” under Technical\n\n                      Collaboration      with   Hennigsdorfer    Stahl   Engineering        GmbH\n\n                      Germany.

Accordingly, the\n\n                      plaintiff Company submitted a detailed application for term loan\n\n                      and working capital facilities besides other non-fund based\n\n                      facilities, to the defendant as a leader of the consortium and other\n\n                      member banks of the consortium.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                               2.4. After such agreement with EEMF, in October and\n\n                      November, 2012, the plaintiff entered into several forward foreign\n\n                      exchange contracts with the defendant in order to hedge the\n\n                      potential equity investment against possible currency fluctuations.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">                      Under these forward contracts, the plaintiff was expected to deliver\n\n                      realized foreign exchange between May, 2013 and November,\n\n                      2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">                               2.5. The plaintiff was negotiating with consortium of\n\n                      banks for debt funding for the project (which was a condition\n\n                      precedent for investment by the investor). However, as debt\n\n                      funding was not tied-up, investor did not invest. Consequently, the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                      5/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                     C.S.(Comm.Div.)

Upon cancellation, the plaintiff incurred loss of INR\n\n                      24.69 Crores, which was duly paid to the defendant. The plaintiff\n\n                      continued its negotiation with consortium of banks. Since there was\n\n                      high volatility in exchange rates, it expected to tie-up debt funding\n\n                      in about one year. Hence, during August, 2013 and September,\n\n                      2013, the plaintiff re-booked the forward contracts with a delivery\n\n                      period of one year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">                               2.6. The plaintiff was given to understand that some of the\n\n                      banks of the consortium, particularly, Punjab National Bank, State\n\n                      Bank of India and State Bank of Patiala did not sanction the\n\n                      proposed term loan, since they did not have any headroom in their\n\n                      exposure norms ceiling for financial year 2013-2014 for the steel\n\n                      industry. Consequently, the plaintiff was again forced to cancel the\n\n                      forward contracts.     Pursuant to the said cancellation of the\n\n                      contracts, the plaintiff earned a surplus of INR 19.50 Crores during\n\n                      the financial year 2014-2015, which was paid to the plaintiff by the\n\n                      defendant.   However, due to undue delay on the part of the\n\n                      defendant and on the part of the other consortium banks in\n\n                      processing and communicating the decision of the consortium, the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                      6/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                       C.S.(Comm.Div.)

Due to the\n\n                      uncertainties in the exact timing of inflow of funds, the plaintiff was\n\n                      constrained to enter into forward exchange contract.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">                               2.7.

The plaintiff had to abort the project after investing\n\n                      about Rs.386,47,10,785/-, which is lying as a dead investment\n\n                      shown as capital work in progress and other non-current assets.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">                               2.8.

This has caused an over all\n\n                      working capital crunch in the company.

As such, the said\n\n                      transactions are subject matter of scrutiny by the Reserve Bank of\n\n                      India.

It is the contention of the learned Senior Counsel\n\n                      appearing for the plaintiff that in October and November, 2012, the\n\n                      plaintiff has entered into several forward foreign exchange\n\n                      contracts with the defendant in order to hedge the potential equity\n\n                      investment against possible currency fluctuations. The defendant\n\n                      has not disputed the contract. The only contention of the\n\n                      defendant, at present, is that the underlying transactions are not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                      16/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                                                        C.S.(Comm.Div.) No.1 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                      genuine and, therefore, they are not bound to pay the gain accrued\n\n                      to the plaintiff. It is the further contention that on earlier occasions,\n\n                      when    the   plaintiff   has   cancelled   forward   foreign    exchange\n\n                      contracts, the plaintiff has incurred a loss of INR 24.69 Crores,\n\n                      which was duly paid to the defendant. In fact, the said amount has\n\n                      been debited from the plaintiff&#x27;s account. In the year 2014-2015\n\n                      and 2015-2016, when the forward exchange contracts dated\n\n                      25.02.2014, 10.09.2013, 06.09.2013, 20.03.2014, 12.05.2014 and\n\n                      09.06.2014 were cancelled, the above cancellations resulted in\n\n                      surplus of Rs.28,23,76,500/-. However, the defendant has not made\n\n                      the payments and written a communication to the Reserve Bank of\n\n                      India. Even, during the clarification is pending with the Reserve\n\n                      Bank of India, they debited other amount from the plaintiff, when\n\n                      the plaintiff has incurred loss in such cancellation. Hence, it is the\n\n                      contention that the conduct of the defendant clearly indicates that\n\n                      only to avoid the amount legally payable to the plaintiff, a defence\n\n                      has been set up as if the underlying transactions are not genuine.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">                               13. The learned Senior Counsel has placed much reliance\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                      17/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                                                     C.S.(Comm.Div.) No.1 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                      on the referred various exhibits to show that the entire transactions\n\n                      are genuine and not a speculative one and the defendant\n\n                      themselves admitted that the transactions are genuine one. Such\n\n                      being a position, the defence set up by the defendant that the\n\n                      underlying transaction is not a genuine transaction and void ab\n\n                      initio cannot be countenanced.     Even, in the reply sent to the\n\n                      Reserve Bank of India by the defendant under Ex.D.7, the\n\n                      defendant has admitted that the underlying transaction, based on\n\n                      which the forward contracts are booked, is genuine and D.W.1, in\n\n                      his evidence, also admitted the same. Even, in the forward\n\n                      contracts, the forward contract itself, the purpose for which the\n\n                      contract was entered, is only for the purpose of equity investment.\n\n                      D.W.1,   in his evidence, has also admitted that the underlying\n\n                      transaction is only for equity investment. It is the further\n\n                      contention that Ex.D.32 - order passed by the Reserve Bank of\n\n                      India does not indicate that the entire transactions are void. The\n\n                      above document only indicates the bank&#x27;s failure to follow the strict\n\n                      procedures. Therefore, it cannot be said that the entire underlying\n\n                      transaction is void, whereas, all the transactions between the\n\n                      plaintiff and the defendant were clearly admitted in the written\n\n                      statement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                      18/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                                                      C.S.(Comm.Div.)

It is his further contention that this nature of\n\n                      transaction, at any stretch of imagination, could be classified as a\n\n                      speculative contract. <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961\n\n                      deals with &quot;speculative transaction&quot;. The proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n                      43(5)</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961, states that a contract in respect\n\n                      of stocks and shares entered into by a dealer or investor therein to\n\n                      guard against loss in his holdings of stocks and shares through\n\n                      price fluctuations shall not be deemed to be a speculative\n\n                      transaction. Hence, it is the contention that there is no violation\n\n                      either under <a href=\"/doc/600757/\" id=\"a_6\">Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</a>, or RBI\n\n                      Circulars. Only the bank has not followed the circular strictly,\n\n                      which was found out by the letter of RBI. Merely such order has\n\n                      been passed, much after the transactions, now, the bank cannot\n\n                      take advantage of the same to contend that the entire transaction is\n\n                      a speculative nature and void ab initio.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">                               15. It is the further contention that in the first tranche of\n\n                      cancellation of forward contracts, the plaintiff has incurred a loss\n\n                      of Rs.24.69 Crores. The same was immediately debited by the\n\n                      defendant in C.C.No.2354. Similarly, during the second tranche of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                      19/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                                                       C.S.(Comm.Div.) No.1 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                      cancellation of forward contracts, the plaintiff has gained a profit of\n\n                      Rs.19.50 Crores, which was duly paid by the defendant. However,\n\n                      in the third tranche of cancellation of forward contracts, a profit of\n\n                      Rs.28.23 Crores was gained by the plaintiff. The above amount has\n\n                      not been paid to the plaintiff, which is the subject matter of the\n\n                      present Suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">                               16. It is the further contention that even after the\n\n                      communication sent to the RBI by the defendant for alleged\n\n                      procedural lapses and violations of guidelines, the defendant has\n\n                      recovered a sum of Rs.27.99 Lakhs for the alleged loss sustained\n\n                      during cancellation of the forward contracts, subsequent to the\n\n                      investigation report. The above facts clearly proved the factum of\n\n                      transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant. Therefore, it is\n\n                      contended that the plaintiff is certainly entitled to decree and\n\n                      judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">                               17. It is also the submission of the learned Senior Counsel\n\n                      that the suit is not barred under Sections 17 and 18 of the\n\n                      Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 and it is not a suit for\n\n                      recovery from the bank to oust the jurisdiction of the Civil Court\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                      20/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                                                           C.S.(Comm.Div.)

Therefore, the Civil Court alone has got jurisdiction to\n\n                      decide the issue. Similarly, the suit claim is only in respect of\n\n                      forward contracts entered with the defendant. No such contracts\n\n                      entered into with any other members of the consortium. Therefore,\n\n                      the contention of the defendant is that the suit is bad for non-\n\n                      joinder of parties also cannot be countenanced.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">                                18.

Per contra, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\n                      the defendant has mainly submitted that the suit is barred by law\n\n                      as per Sections 17 and 18 of the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy\n\n                      Act, 1993 and the suit is also bad for non-joinder of necessary\n\n                      parties and the claim is also barred by limitation and particularly,\n\n                      transaction is not genuine and it is a speculative. The suit is only\n\n                      preemptive action. It is the contention that the hedging contracts\n\n                      were booked with the defendant and with no other consortium\n\n                      bankers. However, the legality of booking the hedging contracts\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                      22/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                                                       C.S.(Comm.Div.) No.1 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                      was held as void ab initio by the RBI and particularly, the plaintiff\n\n                      also addressed a letter to RBI vide Ex.P.43 substantiating their\n\n                      right for payment of the surplus on account of the cancellation of\n\n                      forward contracts made with the defendant as bona fide hedge\n\n                      transactions of tangible contract exposures in the nature of equity\n\n                      participation expected out of an underlying contract             for such\n\n                      transaction and as such, RBI is a proper and necessary party to the\n\n                      suit. It is also contended that the other consortium bankers are also\n\n                      not made as parties. It is the further contention that the delivery\n\n                      period of last contract is shown as 01.06.2015 to 09.06.2015,\n\n                      however, the suit is filed on 12.11.2018, which is beyond the period\n\n                      of three years. Thus, the suit is not maintainable.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">                               21. It is further submitted that the forward exchange\n\n                      contracts were booked during October and November, 2012 for\n\n                      hedging the anticipated equity inflows from the overseas equity\n\n                      investor i.e. EEMF based on the documents in the form of letter of\n\n                      intent dated 18.10.2012 and the agreement for investment dated\n\n                      31.10.2012. Whereas, the said agreement refers only to entering\n\n                      into share purchase agreement which would be the basis for the\n\n                      equity participation by way of foreign investment. Hence, his\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                      23/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                                                          C.S.(Comm.Div.) No.1 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                      contention is that such contract is void under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 23</a> of the\n\n                      Indian Contract Act, 1872, since it is forbidden by law.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">                                 22. The learned Senior Counsel would also contend that\n\n                      Ex.D.3 indicates that there is no valid underlying document, which\n\n                      entitles   to   book   forward   sale   contracts    and     the    frequent\n\n                      cancellations are only for speculative purpose which are serious\n\n                      violations of FEMA and FEDAI Guidelines. It is also stated that\n\n                      Ex.D.1 indicates that the contracts were cancelled on due dates due\n\n                      to non-receipt of anticipated investments. Therefore, the entire\n\n                      transactions between the plaintiff and the defendant are observed\n\n                      as void ab initio by the Reserve Bank of India. Hence, it is the\n\n                      contention that the defendant entered into such contracts on bona\n\n                      fide presumption that the underlying transactions are genuine and\n\n                      in compliance of various statutory regulations and directives of the\n\n                      RBI.    Since the Reserve Bank of India raised this issue and held\n\n                      that there is no underlying contract, the plaintiff cannot seek for\n\n                      recovery of money said to be profit in the hedging transactions.\n\n                      Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">                                 23.

This agreement\n\n                      is in continuation to the letter of intent issued by EEMF vide letter\n\n                      dated 18.10.2012 [Ex.P.1], wherein EEMF agreed to invest upto\n\n                      USD 80 Million Dollars into Suryadev Alloys and Power Private\n\n                      Limited [in short &#x27;SAPPL&#x27;].

From the above documents, there is no doubt in the\n\n                      mind of the Court about the admitted transaction entered between\n\n                      the defendant and the plaintiff. In fact, the defendant with the\n\n                      approval of the Regional Office has entered into a contract. Now,\n\n                      the question arises whether such contracts are speculative nature\n\n                      or not genuine?, as contended by the defendant, which has to be\n\n                      seen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">                               28. The main contention of the defendant is that the\n\n                      contracts were entered and cancelled or re-booked for the same\n\n                      reason. Therefore, it is not genuine. Further, RBI has also raised\n\n                      certain questions. It is to be noted that the admitted facts are, in\n\n                      the first tranche of cancellation of forward contracts, the plaintiff\n\n                      has incurred a loss of Rs.24.69 Crores. The same was recovered\n\n                      from the plaintiff by debiting his account CC.2354. Similarly, it is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                      33/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                                                      C.S.(Comm.Div.) No.1 of 2019</span>\n\n\n                      also admitted that the second tranche of cancellation of forward\n\n                      contracts, profit of Rs.19.50 Crores was gained by the plaintiff. The\n\n                      same was credited to them by the defendant and in the third\n\n                      tranche of transaction, the plaintiff has gained a sum of Rs.28.23\n\n                      Crores.

This\n\n                      communication is sent much after performance of the contract by\n\n                      both sides. Only after the demand, this letter has been sent to the\n\n                      RBI. Be that as it may, in Ex.D.7-the reply sent by the defendant to\n\n                      the show cause notice issued by the RBI, it is clearly stated by the\n\n                      defendant that after satisfying about the genuineness of the\n\n                      underlying exposure, they have entered such contracts which were\n\n                      genuine. Even to the query with regard to the large scale\n\n                      cancellations and the resultant gains, the bank has replied to the\n\n                      effect that equity infusion of USD 40.95 million from Coral Power\n\n                      Development PTE Limited, Singapore into SAPPL has taken place\n\n                      since August, 2015 post-establishment of financial tie-ups in June,\n\n                      2015. It is evident from the flows that the underlying transaction is\n\n                      genuine, but, got delayed due to constraints faced by the company\n\n                      in getting the financial tie-ups in place. The above reply by the\n\n                      bank clearly indicates that a sum of USD 40.95 million has come as\n\n                      equity and the bank has, in fact, certified that the underlying\n\n                      transaction is genuine and the delay was only due to the\n\n                      constraints faced by the company in getting the financial tie-ups in\n\n                      place.

Besides, as already discussed, in the first tranche\n\n                      of cancellation, amount has been debited from the plaintiff and in\n\n                      the second tranche of cancellation, amount was paid to the plaintiff\n\n                      and subsequent to the communication dated 27.06.2015, a sum of\n\n                      Rs.27.99 Lakhs is also debited from the plaintiff. Ex.D.7 clearly\n\n                      proves that only on the basis of the contract entered between the\n\n                      parties, the equity has come in to the bank. The bank is also aware\n\n                      of the fact that the cancellations were due to certain delays in\n\n                      getting financial tie-ups in place.

Ex.P.50 is filed\n\n                      in this regard. D.W.1 has also admitted that a sum of 41 million US\n\n                      Dollars was invested by foreign investors through the defendant\n\n                      bank. D.W.1 has also admitted that when the foreign equity came\n\n                      in US dollars, the bank never raised any objection. D.W.1, in his\n\n                      evidence,   has   clearly   admitted   that   on    the    basis     of   the\n\n                      representations and warranties mentioned in Ex.P.33, foreign\n\n                      investors agreed to bring in equity and brought the equity. D.W.1\n\n                      has also admitted in his evidence that in Exs.P.18, 24 and 25, it is\n\n                      mentioned &quot;only for the purpose of equity (namely foreign\n\n                      exchange contracts)&quot;. It is also admitted by D.W.1 that the bank\n\n                      was always aware that underlying transactions are investments in\n\n                      equity only. D.W.1 has also admitted that despite other consortium\n\n                      bankers had not agreed, the defendant bank has given their share\n\n                      and he has admitted that since there were lot of cancellations and\n\n                      re-booking for the same underlying transaction, their Treasury\n\n                      Department has initiated enquiry into the transactions and also\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                      37/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">\f                                                                          C.S.(Comm.Div.)

Much emphasis has been made on Ex.D.32 by the\n\n                      bank. The Reserve Bank of India, by its order dated 19 November,\n\n                      2019, has held that as per the Foreign Exchange Management\n\n                      (Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts) Regulations, 2000, the\n\n                      authorized dealer of the defendant bank is required to satisfy itself\n\n                      about   the   genuineness   of   the   underlying     exposure       through\n\n                      verification of documentary evidence. However, it was observed\n\n                      that verification of documentary evidence for establishing the\n\n                      genuineness of the underlying exposure was not carried out by IOB.\n\n                      Similarly, circular No.58, dated December 15, 2011 and Circular\n\n                      No.32, dated 28 December, 2010, have not been followed and held\n\n                      that although a legally binding agreement of investment was signed\n\n                      between SAPPL and EEMF on October, 31, 2012, the same was not\n\n                      definitive and was contingent upon financial tie-ups to be secured\n\n                      by SAPPL. Hence, it is the contention of the RBI that the forward\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                      38/51</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                                                     C.S.(Comm.Div.)

Further, in\n\n                      Paragraph No.4 of its order, it has been opined that cancellation\n\n                      and re-booking of the forward contract was a rollover of the\n\n                      contracts and held that there is no contravention. Similarly,\n\n                      Paragraph No.5 speaks about the recovery of Rs.24.69 Crores\n\n                      towards the loss suffered by the plaintiff and gain of Rs.19.50\n\n                      Crores was passed on to the plaintiff in the year 2014.               The\n\n                      Empowered Committee did not find it appropriate to consider IOB\n\n                      to be in contravention of the same matter again and finally, in\n\n                      Paragraph No.8, it is held that the bank has not followed various\n\n                      directions of the RBI as regards foreign exchange derivative\n\n                      contracts entered into by the defendant with the plaintiff.\n\n                      Accordingly, a penalty was imposed on the bank for a sum of\n\n                      Rs.3,30,000/- for violations specified under paragraph.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">                               31.

The main focus of the order\n\n                      indicates that there are some procedural lapses on the part of IOB\n\n                      while entering into such contracts. Therefore, merely because the\n\n                      RBI found fault with the bank in violating certain guidelines, it\n\n                      cannot be said that the entire contract is void ab initio or forbidden\n\n                      by law. In fact, various contracts entered between IOB are not in\n\n                      dispute. Ex.D.7 and the evidence of D.W.1 make it clear that IOB, in\n\n                      fact, verified the credentials and nature of the contract and share\n\n                      purchase agreement entered by the plaintiff and investment\n\n                      agreement with the investors has been thoroughly considered by\n\n                      the bank and they formed an opinion that underlying transactions\n\n                      are genuine. Therefore, merely because the bank was found with\n\n                      procedural lapses by the RBI, at a later point of time, it cannot be\n\n                      said that the entire contract is void ab initio and prohibited.

Such being a position, merely because profits\n\n                      or loss credited or debited to C.C.No.2354, it cannot be said that\n\n                      both are same transactions. In fact, C.C.No.2354 is a different\n\n                      transaction.

The cash credit\n\n                      facilities opened an independent contract. The parties are bound by\n\n                      that.
