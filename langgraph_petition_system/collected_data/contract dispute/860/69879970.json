The petitioner-Company supplied about 6\n\nlakhs        meters   to   the         respondent-BESCOM,                who\n\nundertook       the   work        of    replacing      of    old     electro\n\nmechanical power meters provided to the consumers\n\nearlier and also to provide such new electronic static\n\nmeters in the retail outlets to be opened by the\n\npetitioner-Company           in        various      sub-divisions           of\n\nrespondent-BESCOM at the said rate.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">        4.

Such complex business and\n\neconomic contracts have several factual and legal\n\naspects which require the relevant evidence to prove\n\nand determine the respective rights and obligations of\n\nthe parties to the contract.       The writ jurisdiction is\n\nabsolutely ill-suited for such matters and therefore, the\n\nparties to the contract should be normally relegated to\n\nthe remedy by way of civil suits. It is only rarely when\n\nthe action of the respondents who are State or State\n\ninstrumentalities and whose actions even in contractual\n\nmatters is ex-facie or per se illegal, unfair and arbitrary\n\nthat the Court may for the limited purposes invoke even\n\nthe writ jurisdiction in such cases.

Firstly, the contract between the parties is\n     a contract in the realm of private law. It is not a\n     statutory contract.    It is governed by the\n     provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_36\">Contract Act</a> or, maybe, also\n     by certain provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_37\">Sale of Goods Act</a>.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">     Any dispute relating to interpretation of the\n     terms and conditions of such a contract cannot\n     be agitated, and could not have been agitated,\n     in a writ petition. That is a matter either for\n     arbitration as provided by the contract or for\n     the civil court, as the case may be. Whether\n     any amount is due to the respondent from\n     the    appellant-Government             under        the\n     contract and, if so, how much and the\n     further question whether retention or refusal to\n     pay any amount by the Government is justified,\n     or not, are all matters which cannot be\n     agitated in or adjudicated upon in a writ\n     petition.

Section 43-A(1) provides that a\ngenerating company may enter into a\ncontract    for    the      sale     of    electricity\ngenerated by it with the Electricity\nBoard. As regards the determination of\ntariff for the sale of electricity by a\ngenerating             company            to        the\nBoard, <a href=\"/doc/434568/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 43(1)(2)</a> provides that the\ntariff shall be determined in accordance\nwith the norms regarding operation and\nplant-load factor as may be <a href=\"/doc/1941195/\" id=\"a_44\">laid down\nby</a> the authority and in accordance with\nthe rates of depreciation and reasonable\nreturn and such other factors as may be\ndetermined from time to time by the\nCentral Government by a notification in\nthe Official Gazette.

Merely because a contract\nis entered into in exercise of an enabling\npower conferred by a statute that by\nitself cannot render the contract a\nstatutory contract. If entering into a\ncontract containing the prescribed terms\nand conditions is a must under the\nstatute then that contract becomes a\nstatutory     contract.           If    a     contract\nincorporates         certain           terms       and\nconditions in it which are statutory then\nthe said contract to that extent is\nstatutory.

Apart from the above reasons\n     given by us to interfere with the judgment of\n     the Appellate Bench of the High Court, we\n     have one other good reason why we should\n     not drive the appellants to a suit. The claim\n     petition   appellants    was     rejected      by     the\n     respondent in the year 1994. The respondent\n     challenged the basis of rejection by way of a\n     writ petition in the year 1996. The objection\n     as to the maintainability of the petition was\n     rejected by the High Court by its judgment\n     dated 15-5-1997. We are now at the end of\n                                             Date of Judgment:18-09-2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                      W.P.No.8001/2015</span>\n                                      M/s.LANDIS+GYR LIMITED.Vs.\n                                The General Manager (M &amp; C) and others.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                            33/36</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      the year 2003. We at this distance of time\n      and stage of litigation, do not think it\n      proper to relegate the parties to a suit.\n      To direct the appellants to approach a civil\n      court at this stage would be doing injustice to\n      the appellants. In this view of ours, we are\n      supported by a number of decisions of this\n      Court like in Shambhu Prasad Agarwal Vs.\n      Bhola Ram Agarwal wherein this Court\n      though noticed the fact that the appellants\n      had an alternate remedy for issuance of a\n      letter of administration, it refused to dismiss\n      the appeal on the grounds: (SCC p 715, para\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      5)\n\n             Since    considerable        time       has\n       elapsed, the interest of justice demands\n       that the proceedings should come to an\n       end as early as possible and that the\n       appeal should not be dismissed merely\n       on highly technical ground.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">      The aforesaid fact of long lapse of time which\n\ndissuaded the Court not to relegate the parties to the\n\nCivil suit is not available in the facts of the present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                                             Date of Judgment:18-09-2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                      W.P.No.8001/2015</span>\n                                      M/s.LANDIS+GYR LIMITED.Vs.\n                                The General Manager (M &amp; C) and others.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                            34/36</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1635654\" id=\"span_84\">22.

Now if appellant entered into a\n     solemn contract in discharge and performance\n     of its statutory duty and the respondent acted\n     upon it, the statutory corporation cannot be\n     allowed to act arbitrarily so as to cause harm\n     and injury, flowing from its unreasonable\n     conduct,   to   the   respondent.       In    such      a\n     situation, the Court is not powerless from\n     holding the appellant to its promise and it can\n     be enforced by a writ of mandamus directing\n     it to perform its statutory duty. A petition\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution would\n     certainly lie to direct performance of statutory\n                                                Date of Judgment:18-09-2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                         W.P.No.8001/2015</span>\n                                         M/s.LANDIS+GYR LIMITED.Vs.\n                                   The General Manager (M &amp; C) and others.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                               35/36</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">      duty    by     &#x27;other   authority&#x27;    as     envisaged\n      by <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 12.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1153646\" id=\"span_87\">23.

Therefore, none of the judgments cited at the\n\nBar by the learned counsel for the petitioner are of any\n\nhelp to the petitioner and this Court is of the considered\n\nopinion that there is no justification to interfere in the\n\npresent case at the instance of the petitioner and the\n\npetitioner is not entitled to the relief as claimed or\n                                           Date of Judgment:18-09-2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                    W.P.No.8001/2015</span>\n                                    M/s.LANDIS+GYR LIMITED.Vs.\n                              The General Manager (M &amp; C) and others.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                          36/36</span>\n\notherwise.
