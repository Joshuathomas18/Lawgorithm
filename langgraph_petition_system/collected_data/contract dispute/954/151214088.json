It may not accept the offer even\n                                      though it happens to be the highest or the lowest.

Just as principles of natural justice ensure fair decision where\n                                      the function is quasi-judicial, the doctrine of fairness is evolved to\n                                      ensure fair action where the function is administrative. But it can\n                                      certainly not be invoked to amend, alter or vary the express terms of\n                                      the contract between the parties. This is so, even if the contract is\n                                      governed by statutory provisions, i.e., where it is a statutory contract\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">                                      -- or rather more so.
