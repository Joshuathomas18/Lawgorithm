Therefore, the delay\n\n             in his <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 161</a> CrPC statement impairs his assertion of being an\n\n             eyewitness, making it unworthy of acceptance;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">         (iv) Although Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahant Ashwani Das\n\n             (PW-25), and Rama Devi (PW-24) have testified to the presence of\n\n             Shashi Bhushan Singh (PW-42) as an eyewitness, this assertion\n\n             should not be accepted.

Such a presumption imposes a\n\n       rigid formula for determining who should be an informant, which the law\n\n       does not envision. It is an accepted and admitted position that the name\n\n       of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) has been mentioned in the fardbeyan\n\n       and in the FIR as one of the persons present at the hospital. Any person\n\n       can be an informant of a case, and the police may also register a case\n\n       on their own. The rationale of the High Court for dismissing the testimony\n\n       of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) is fundamentally flawed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">16.    Yet another reason for rejecting his testimony stems from contradictions\n\n       about the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9) as an assailant at the hospital.\n\n       In his police statement, Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1) identified Rajan\n\n       Tiwari (A-9) as being at the hospital, but in his court testimony, he stated\n\n       that Rajan Tiwari (A-9) was not present. In our considered view, this\n\n       contradiction does not weaken Paras Nath Chaudhury’s (PW-1) account\n\n       of witnessing Mantu Tiwari (A-4) and Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna\n\n       Shukla (A-8) commit the offence. Indian law does not recognise the\n\n       doctrine – falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"627745\" id=\"span_23\">In <a href=\"/doc/627745/\" id=\"a_19\">Deep Chand and Others\n\n       v.

Only reliable evidence\n\n       should be taken into consideration. The court is not denuded of its power\n\n       to make an appropriate assessment.

On 13.06.1998,\n\n       Rama Devi (PW-24) had taken food to the hospital at about 2:50 p.m.\n\n       and stayed there till about 7:00 p.m. From the hospital, she went to\n\n       Maurya Lok to purchase some items for her sons and remained there for\n\n       about one and a half hours. Whilst leaving Maurya Lok, she learnt about\n\n       the attack on her husband, Brij Bihari Prasad. She immediately reached\n\n       IGIMS hospital where she saw Brij Bihari Prasad and Lakshmeshwar\n\n       Sahu lying dead in a pool of blood. Several people had gathered there.\n\n       She established the presence of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1),\n\n       Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10)\n\n       at the hospital.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1438332\" id=\"span_35\">19 See <a href=\"/doc/1438332/\" id=\"a_22\">C.

Rama Devi (PW-24) was at\n\n       the hospital for a considerable time before and after the incident. Her\n\n       version is factually accurate and fosters confidence. Thus, the testimony\n\n       of Rama Devi (PW-24) can be used to partly corroborate and affirm the\n\n       testimonies of Paras Nath Chaudhury (PW-1), Mahanth Ashwani Das\n\n       (PW-25), and Amarendra Kumar Sinha (PW-10).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">25.

The occurrence having taken place at night on 13.06.1998, normally the\n\n       FIR should have been sent to the jurisdictional magistrate on\n\n       14.06.1998. However, 14.06.1998 being a Sunday was a holiday. The\n\n       FIR was forwarded to the jurisdictional magistrate on 15.06.1998. There\n\n       is, therefore, an explanation for the delay in forwarding a copy of the FIR\n\n       to the jurisdictional magistrate in terms of <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 157</a> of the CrPC. It is\n\n       trite law that a delay in forwarding the FIR to the jurisdictional magistrate\n\n       is not fatal to the prosecution case.

However, the witnesses to this meeting, Sone\n\n       Lal (PW-32) and Lal Babu Chaudhury (PW-39), turned hostile and did\n\n       not support the prosecution version.

The telephone\n\n       records indicate calls made from Mokama landline number 32772 to\n\n       Shashi Kumar Rai (A-7), Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased) and Munna\n\n       Shuka (A-8). The prosecution relied on the report dated 29.10.1999\n\n       (Exhibit-1) submitted by Shiya Sharan Ram (PW-2), Sub-Divisional\n\n       Engineer (Vigilance), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, which stated that\n\n       the landline number was subscribed in the name of one Shrawan Kumar\n\n       Agrawal but was operational in the house of Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1) at\n\n       Mokama. However, the said report of Shiya Sharan Ram (PW-2) is\n\n       based on the physical verification of S.M.M. Rahman, Sub-Divisional\n\n       Engineer, Barh and Jitan Mehta, Junior Telecom Officer, Hatida, both of\n\n       whom, have not been examined. Further, Shrawan Kumar Agrawal has\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Crl.A. Nos. 2623-2631 of 2014 &amp; Ors.

The prosecution version\n\n       establishing the landline number as belonging to Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1)\n\n       hinges on the testimony of M.L. Meena (PW-60), Assistant IO, CBI.\n\n       However, M.L. Meena (PW-60) accepts in his testimony that he did not\n\n       enter the house to verify the existence of a telephone set. Rather, his\n\n       entire version is based on his interaction with the step-mother of Suraj\n\n       Bhan Singh (A-1). The telephone records indicating the exchange of\n\n       calls between 11.05.1998 and 11.06.1998, as deposed by Rai Singh\n\n       Khatri (PW-62), do not substantively prove and establish the conspiracy\n\n       charge in the absence of revelatory and weighty incriminating material.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">39.    The CBI also relied upon the post-incident celebration held in village\n\n       Khanjah Ghat on 15.06.1998 at the behest of Vijay Kumar Shukla @\n\n       Munna Shukla (A-8).

The statement of Avadhesh Kumar Singh\n\n       (PW-36), who did not turn hostile, was recorded one year and two\n\n       months after the date of occurrence. The prosecution has not placed any\n\n       material on record to showcase how M.L. Meena, IO, CBI (PW-60) had\n\n       traced Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36), though Rai Singh Khatri, IO,\n\n       CBI (PW-62) had stated that M.L. Meena, IO, CBI (PW-60) had got in\n\n       touch with Avadhesh Kumar Singh (PW-36).

To fortify the charge of conspiracy, the prosecution has further relied on\n\n       the fax message (Exhibit-6) regarding the threat to the life of Brij Bihari\n\n       Prasad. This fax message would not help the prosecution implicate the\n\n       accused persons – Suraj Bhan Singh (A-1), Mukesh Singh (A-2), Lallan\n\n       Singh (A-3) and Captain Sunil Singh (A-5) (since deceased) – on the\n\n       charge of criminal conspiracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">\nDiscrepancy regarding the presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">41.

Even though Mahanth Ashwani Das (PW-25) had referred to the\n\n       presence of Rajan Tiwari (A-9), given the discrepancy in the statement\n\n       of the two eye-witnesses, we feel that the benefit of doubt must be given\n\n       to Rajan Tiwari (A-9).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_164\">\nConclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">42.
