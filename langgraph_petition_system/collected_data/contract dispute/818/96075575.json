Thus, it is clear that the deliberations of the Board of\n\n    Directors in its various meetings were only proposals which\n\n    definitely were required to be looked into and final decision\n\n    thereupon came to be taken only on 30.07.2015 when the minutes\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                           ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 21:02:03 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                        25</span>\n\n\n\n\n    of 205 th meeting stood superseded.

An acknowledgement of liability\n\n    has to be clear, unambiguous, unequivocal and unconditional\n\n    which is not the fact situation obtaining in the instant case.

The discussion so far clearly goes to indicate that the\n\n    entire case of the respondent only hinges around the so-called\n\n    admission/acknowledgment of the debt by the appellant.

This shift-in stand of the respondent is quite contrary\n\n    and antithetical to its earlier stand wherein it was categorically\n\n\n    claimed that the debt due had been admitted/acknowledged by the\n\n    appellant. Obviously, the respondent opted for latter stand\n\n\n\n\n    knowing fully well that there infact exists &#x27;dispute&#x27; within the\n\n\n\n\n\n    meaning of GCC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_132\">    57.         &#x27;Dispute&#x27; in normal parlance would mean &quot;difference\n\n\n\n\n\n    over an issue&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">                Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary defines &#x27;dispute&#x27; to mean &quot;a\n\n    conflict or controversy&quot;, esp. one that has given rise to a particular\n\n    lawsuit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">                &#x27;Arbitral dispute&#x27; has been defined to mean &quot;a dispute\n\n    that can properly be resolved by arbitration&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">    58.

There can be no gainsaying that &#x27;admission or\n\n    acknowledgement of debt&#x27; and &#x27;disputed debt&#x27; are irreconcible and\n\n\n    are pleas which are diametrically opposed to each other.

Thus, we have no hesitation to conclude that the so-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">    called debts were never infact acknowledged or admitted, but\n\n\n\n\n\n    were rather disputed by the appellant and that is why the\n\n    respondent itself chose to invoke the modified Clause 67 of the\n\n    GCC to have the matter referred to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">    62.         From the various factors, facets, contours and\n\n    chronicles emerging from the facts of the case, it is clearly evident\n\n    that the respondent could not have used the machinery of winding\n\n    up as a means of realizing the so-called debt due from the\n\n    appellant company as it is not a legitimate means of seeking\n\n    enforcement of payment of debt which has bonafidely been\n\n    disputed by the appellant.

As observed earlier, the defence raised by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    appellant company is a substantial and bonafide one and not mere\n\n\n\n\n                                     of\n    moonshine and has to be finally adjudicated upon merits before\n\n    the appropriate forum. Even the so-called &#x27;dues&#x27; have not been\n                   rt\n    admitted by the appellant. The appellant company is not only a\n\n    commercially solvent company, but is a government company as\n\n    defined under the Act. It is a &#x27;Mini Ratna&#x27; company of the\n\n\n    Government of India. The respondent cannot gain any advantage\n\n    on the basis of Board meeting No.205 dated 14.07.2011 which as\n\n\n\n\n    observed earlier was only a proposal and final decision thereupon\n\n\n\n\n\n    was taken by the appellant in its 240 th meeting held on 30.07.2015\n\n    wherein the minutes of 205 th meeting of the Board of Directors\n\n\n\n\n\n    came to be superseded.

It is beyond dispute that the machinery for winding up\n\n    will not be allowed to be utilized merely as a means to realizing its\n\n    debt due from a company. In case, there exists a bonafide dispute\n\n    and the dues are not admitted, the winding up petition is required\n\n    to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">    65.         This Court cannot remain oblivious to the fact that a\n\n    creditor&#x27;s winding up petition in certain situations would give rise\n\n    to speculation and may rather imply insolvency or bad financial\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 21:02:04 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                     34</span>\n\n\n\n\n    position of the company sought to be wound up and would\n\n    damage the creditworthiness or the financial standing of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                            .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">    company and may also lead to other economic and social\n\n    ramifications. In such situations, the competitors would rejoice and\n\n\n\n\n\n    the same in turn would adversely affect its reputations and shares\n\n\n\n\n                                     of\n    in the market and thereby push the company into a state of acute\n\n    insolvency. In such situations, the Company Courts are required\n                   rt\n    to be more vigilant and ensure that its process is not misused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">    66.        A    Company     Court    is   required         to     act     with\n\n    circumspection, care and caution and ensure that any attempt\n\n\n    made to pressurize the company to pay a debt which is seriously\n\n    and substantially disputed is refuted. The Company Court cannot\n\n\n\n\n    function as a debt collecting agency and has to guard itself against\n\n\n\n\n\n    vexatious abuse of its process and should, therefore, not permit a\n\n    party to unreasonably set the law into motion, especially, when the\n\n\n\n\n\n    defence raised by the company sought to be wound up is bonafide\n\n    and substantial one and in these circumstances the remedy of the\n\n    aggrieved party is elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">    67.        Considering the facts of the case, the law on the\n\n    subject including the statutory notice and also the other\n\n    correspondence between the parties, we are absolutely clear in\n\n    our mind that the debt is not admitted debt and the dispute raised\n\n    by the appellant is not only a substantial but a bonafide one and it\n\n    cannot be held that the appellant has neglected to pay. Therefore,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                         ::: Downloaded on - 15/04/2017 21:02:04 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                     35</span>\n\n\n\n\n    the case would not fall under <a href=\"/doc/1901728/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 433 (e)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1676812/\" id=\"a_28\">433 (1) (a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/265830/\" id=\"a_29\">439</a>\n\n    of the Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">    68.           Notably, it is not even represented by the respondent\n\n    that the company is not a going concern and, therefore, it cannot\n\n\n\n\n\n    be said that the appellant company has lost its financial\n\n\n\n\n                                     of\n    substratum. As already observed, the jurisdiction of this Court\n\n    under the aforesaid provisions of the Act cannot be permitted to be\n                     rt\n    used as a substitute for deciding the bonafide dispute which can\n\n    only be done by way of filing an appropriate civil suit before the\n\n    competent Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">    69.           For the foregoing reasons, we find merit in these\n\n    appeals and are of the firm view that no case for winding up of the\n\n\n\n\n    appellant company is made out. In the result, both the appeals\n\n\n\n\n\n    succeed and the Company Petition No.4 of 2015 filed before the\n\n    learned Company Judge fails and is accordingly dismissed,\n\n\n\n\n\n    leaving the respondent to resort to such remedies, as may be\n\n    available to it, under the law.
