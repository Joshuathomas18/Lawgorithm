Mr   Tulzapurkar   learned   senior   counsel   placed   reliance   on   the \n    judgment of Supreme Court in case of State of Goa Vs. Praveen Enterprises  \n                             \n    (2012)12 Supreme court Cases 581  in support of his submission that the \n    issue of limitation is not an issue that has to be decided in an application \n                            \n    under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a> of the Act.  Paragraphs 35 and 36 of the said judgment read \n    thus : \n                &quot; 35.   The difference between a dead/stale claim and a mere time barred claim  \n      \n\n\n                was explained by this Court in Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. SPS Engineering  \n                Ltd. MANU/SC/0122/2011 : 2011 (2) SCALE 291 thus:\n   \n\n\n\n                            &quot; 14. When it is said that the Chief Justice or his designate may choose  \n                      to decide whether the claim is a dead claim, it is implied that he will do so  \n                      only when the claim is evidently and patently a long time barred claim and  \n\n\n\n\n\n                      there   is   No.   need   for   any   detailed   consideration   of   evidence.   We   may  \n                      elucidate by an illustration: If the contractor makes a claim a decade or so  \n                      after completion of the work without referring to any acknowledgement of  \n                      a liability or other factors that kept the claim alive in law, and the claim is  \n                      patently long time barred, the Chief Justice or his designate will examine  \n                      whether the claim is a dead claim (that is, a long time barred claim). On  \n\n\n\n\n\n                      the other hand, if the contractor makes a claim for payment, beyond three  \n                      years of completing of the work but say within five years of completion of  \n                      work,  and alleges that the final bill was drawn up and  payments  were  \n                      made within three years before the claim, the court will not enter into a  \n                      disputed question whether the claim was barred by limitation or not. The  \n                      court will leave the matter to the decision of the Tribunal. If the distinction  \n                      between apparent and obvious dead claims, and claims involving disputed  \n                      issues of limitation is not kept in view, the Chief Justice or his designate  \n                      will end up deciding the question of limitation in all applications under  \n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                12/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                      .. 13 ..

The   issue   of   limitation   is   not   an   issue   that   has   to   be   decided   in   an  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n                  application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_18\">Section  11</a>  of the Act. SBP &amp; Co. and Boghara Polyfab held  \n                  that   the   Chief   Justice   or   his   designate   will   not   examine   issues   relating   to  \n                  limitation, but may consider in appropriate cases, whether the application was in  \n                  regard to a claim which on the face of it was so hopelessly barred by time, that it  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n                  is already a dead/stale claim which did not deserve to be resurrected and referred  \n                  to arbitration. The said decisions do not support the Respondent&#x27;s contention that  \n                  the details of all claims should be set out in the application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 11</a> of \n                  the Act and that details of all counter claims should be set out in the statement of  \n                  objections, and that a claim or a counter claim which is not referred to or set out  \n                  in   the   pleadings   in   the   proceedings   under   <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_20\">Section  11</a>  of   the   Act,   cannot   be  \n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n                  entertained or decided by the arbitral tribunal.&quot;\n\n\n\n    20.\n                                 \n                 Learned senior counsel submits that whether development on the \n                                \n    plots in question  commenced by the  respondents or not and consequently \n    whether clause 31 of the agreement would apply or not, this issue also can be \n    decided by the arbitral tribunal.  \n      \n\n     \n    21.          Learned senior counsel submits that the applicants have invoked \n   \n\n\n\n    clause 34 of the agreement in so far as arbitration application No.107 of 2012 \n    is concerned and clause 31 in so far as arbitration application (l) No.1180 of \n\n\n\n\n\n    2014 is concerned.   Both the clauses invoked by the applicants in both these \n    matters   are   part   of   the   same   agreement   i.e.   Partnership   Deed   dated \n    25/03/1997.  The intention of both the parties that the dispute arising under \n    the   agreement   has   to   be   referred   to   the   arbitrator   is  ex-facie  clear.     The \n\n\n\n\n\n    respondents  cannot be allowed  to raise  such issue  about non existence  of \n    arbitration agreement contrary to the arbitration agreement forming part of \n    the Partnership Deed.  The Courts are required to aid and support the arbitral \n    process and not to bring to a grinding halt.   In support of this submission \n    learned senior counsel placed reliance on Judgment of Supreme Court in case \n\n    Asmita                                                                                                         13/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                    .. 14 ..

On the other hand, Dr. Singhvi has submitted, as noticed earlier, that the  \n                intention of the parties to arbitrate is clear. Even if the existence of the main  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                contract   is   under   dispute,   the   court   is   concerned   only   with   the   arbitration  \n                agreement i.e. the arbitration clause. The submission of Dr. Singhvi is that the  \n                absence of IPLA will not nullify the arbitration clause. \n\n                77.  We find considerable merit in the submissions made by Dr. Singhvi. It cannot  \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n                be   disputed   that   there   is   a   legal   relationship   between   the   parties   of   a   long  \n                standing.   <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  44</a>  of   the   Indian   Arbitration   Act,   1996   applies   to   arbitral  \n                awards of differences between persons arising out of legal proceedings. Such a  \n                               \n                relationship may be contractual or not, so long it is  considered as commercial  \n                under   the   laws   in   force   in   India.   Further,   that   legal   relationship   must   be   in  \n                pursuance of an agreement, in writing, for arbitration, to which the New York  \n                              \n                Convention applies. The court can decline to make a reference to arbitration in  \n                case   it   finds   that   the   arbitration   agreement   is   null   and   void,   inoperative   or  \n                incapable of being performed. There are no pleadings to that effect in the plaint.  \n                The Daman Trial Court findings that the contract is null and void and not based  \n                on free consent were rendered in the absence of relevant pleadings. There is a  \n      \n\n                mention   in   one   of   the   e-mails   that   Dr.   Wobben   has   taken   advantage   of   his  \n                friendship with Mr. Yogesh Mehra. But that seems to be more of a sulk than a  \n   \n\n\n\n                genuine grievance. Even if one accepts the truth of such a statement, the same is  \n                not reflected in the pleadings. Therefore, no serious note could be taken of that  \n                statement at this stage.\n                80.       It   must   also   be   noticed   here   that   the   relationship   between   the   parties  \n                formally commenced on 12th  January, 1994 when the parties entered into the  \n\n\n\n\n\n                first SHA and TKHA. Even under that SHA, Article XVI inter alia provided for  \n                resolution   of  disputes   by   arbitration.   The   TKHA   also  contained   an  identically  \n                worded   arbitration   clause,   under   Article   XIX.   This   intention   to   arbitrate   has  \n                continued   without   waiver.   In   the   face   of   this,   the   question   of   the   concluded  \n                contract   becomes   irrelevant,   for   the   purposes   of   making   the   reference   to   the  \n\n\n\n\n\n                Arbitral Tribunal. It must be clarified that the doubt raised by the Appellant is  \n                that there is no concluded IPLA, i.e. the substantive contract. But this can have no  \n                effect on the existence of a binding Arbitration Agreement in view of Clause 3.  \n                The   parties   have   irrevocably   agreed   to   resolve   all   the   disputes   through  \n                Arbitration. Parties can not be permitted to avoid arbitration, without satisfying  \n                the Court that it would be just and in the interest of all the parties not to proceed  \n                with arbitration. Furthermore in arbitration proceedings, courts are required to  \n                aid and support the arbitral process, and not to bring it to a grinding halt. If we  \n                were to accept the submissions of Mr. Nariman, we would be playing havoc with  \n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                      14/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                   .. 15 ..

This would be of no benefit to any of the  \n                parties involved in these unnecessarily complicated and convoluted proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     \n                81. In the facts of this case, we have no hesitation in concluding that the parties  \n                must   proceed   with   the   Arbitration.   All   the   difficulties   pointed   out   by   Mr.  \n                Rohinton Nariman can be addressed by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n                83.   The concept of separability of the arbitration clause/agreement from the  \n                underlying contract is a necessity to ensure that the intention of the parties to  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n                resolve the disputes by arbitration does not evaporate into thin air with every  \n                challenge to the legality, validity, finality or breach of the underlying contract.  \n                <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_22\">The Indian Arbitration Act, 1996</a>, as noticed above, under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 16</a> accepts the  \n                concept   that   the   main   contract   and   the   arbitration   agreement   form   two  \n                independent contracts. Commercial rights and obligations are contained in the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n                underlying, substantive, or the main contract. It is followed by a second contract,  \n                which   expresses  the   agreement   and   the  intention of  the  parties   to resolve  the  \n                              \n                disputes   relating   to   the   underlying   contract   through   arbitration.   A   remedy   is  \n                elected by parties outside the normal civil court remedy. It is true that support of  \n                the National Courts would be required to ensure the success of arbitration, but  \n                this   would   not   detract   from   the   legitimacy   or   independence   of   the   collateral  \n                             \n                arbitration agreement, even if it is contained in a contract, which is claimed to be  \n                void or voidable or unconcluded by one of the parties.\n                88.     In our opinion, the Courts have to adopt a pragmatic approach and not a  \n                pedantic or technical approach while interpreting or construing an arbitration  \n      \n\n                agreement   or   arbitration   clause.   Therefore,   when   faced   with   a   seemingly  \n                unworkable arbitration clause, it would be the duty of the Court to make the  \n                same   workable   within   the   permissible   limits   of   the   law,   without   stretching   it  \n   \n\n\n\n                beyond the boundaries of recognition. In other words, a common sense approach  \n                has to be adopted to give effect to the intention of the parties to arbitrate. In such  \n                a case, the court ought to adopt the attitude of a reasonable business person,  \n                having business common sense as well as being equipped with the knowledge that  \n\n\n\n\n\n                may   be   peculiar   to   the   business   venture.   The   arbitration   clause   cannot   be  \n                construed with a purely legalistic mindset, as if one is construing a provision in a  \n                statute.   We   may   just   add   here   the   words   of   Lord   Diplock   in  The   Antaios  \n                Compania Neviera SA v. Salen Rederierna AB which are as follows:\n                If detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is  \n                going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business common sense, it must be made  \n\n\n\n\n\n                to yield to business common sense.\n\n                We entirely agree with the aforesaid observation.\n                89.   This view of ours is also supported by the following judgments which were  \n                relied upon by Dr. Singhvi:\n                89.1  In Visa International Limited (supra), it was inter alia held that:\n\n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                  15/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                   .. 16 ..

This Court in Rukmanibai Gupta v. Collector, Jabalpur has held (at SCC  \n                      p. 560, para 6) that what is required to be ascertained while construing a  \n                               \n                      clause   is   &quot;whether   the   parties   have   agreed   that   if   disputes   arise   between  \n                      them   in   respect   of   the   subject-matter   of   contract   such   dispute   shall   be  \n                      referred   to   arbitration,   then   such   an   arrangement   would   spell   out   an  \n                              \n                      arbitration agreement&quot;.\n\n                29.  In   M.   Dayanand   Reddy   v.   A.P.   Industrial   Infrastructure   Corpn.   Ltd.,   this  \n                Court has held that: (SCC p. 142, para 8)\n      \n\n                       8. ... an arbitration clause is not required to be stated in any particular  \n                       form. If the intention of the parties to refer the dispute to arbitration can be  \n                       clearly   ascertained   from   the   terms   of   the   agreement,   it   is   immaterial  \n   \n\n\n\n                       whether or not the expression arbitration or &#x27;arbitrator&#x27; or &#x27;arbitrators&#x27; has  \n                       been used in the agreement.\n\n                       (original emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n\n                       30. The Court is required, therefore, to decide whether the existence of an  \n                       agreement to refer the dispute to arbitration can be clearly ascertained in  \n                       the facts and circumstances of the case. This, in turn, may depend upon the  \n                       intention of the parties to be gathered from the correspondence exchanged  \n                       between   the   parties,   the   agreement   in   question   and   the   surrounding  \n                       circumstances. What is required is to gather the intention of the parties as  \n\n\n\n\n\n                       to   whether   they   have   agreed   for   resolution   of   the   disputes   through  \n                       arbitration. What is required to be decided in an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_24\">Section  \n                       11</a> of the 1996 Act is: whether there is an arbitration agreement as defined  \n                       in the said Act.\n\n                90.    It is a well recognized principle of arbitration jurisprudence in almost all  \n                the jurisdictions, especially those following the UNCITRAL Model Law, that the  \n                Courts play a supportive role in encouraging the arbitration to proceed rather  \n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                    16/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                    .. 17 ..                                ARBAP-107-12\n                                                                                      @ ARBAP(L)1180/14\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   \n                than   letting   it   come   to   a   grinding   halt.   Another   equally   important   principle  \n                recognized   in   almost   all   jurisdictions   is   the   least   intervention   by   the   Courts.  \n                <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_25\">Under the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996</a>, <a href=\"/doc/310829/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 5</a> specifically lays down that:   &quot;  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                5.  Extent of judicial intervention : - &quot;Notwithstanding anything contained in any  \n                other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial  \n                authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part&quot;. Keeping in view  \n                the aforesaid, we find force in the submission of Dr. Singhvi that the arbitration  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                clause as it stands cannot be frustrated on the ground that it is unworkable.\n                91.      Dr. Singhvi has rightly submitted that the un-workability in this case is  \n                attributed   only   to   the   machinery   provision.   And   the   arbitration   agreement,  \n                otherwise, fulfils the criteria laid down under <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 44</a> of the Indian Arbitration  \n                Act, 1996. Given that two Arbitrators have been appointed, the missing line that  \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n                &quot;the two Arbitrators appointed by the parties shall appoint the third Arbitrator&quot;  \n                can be read into the arbitration clause. The omission is so obvious that the court  \n                can legitimately supply the missing line. In these circumstances, the Court would  \n                               \n                apply   the   officious   bystander   principle,   as   explained   by   MacKinnon,   LJ   in  \n                Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries  () to interpret the clause. In Shirlaw, it was  \n                held that:\n                              \n                      prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need not be  \n                expressed is something so obvious that it goes without saying; so that, if, while  \n                the parties were making their bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest  \n                some express provision for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him  \n                with a common &#x27;Oh, of course!\n      \n\n\n                In construing an arbitration clause, it is not necessary to employ the strict rules of  \n   \n\n\n\n                interpretation   which   may   be   necessary   to   construe   a   statutory   provision.   The  \n                court would be well within its rights to set right an obvious omission without  \n                necessarily leaving itself open to the criticism of having reconstructed the clause.\n                92.         Further, we find support in this context from the following extract of  \n\n\n\n\n\n                Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England (Vol. 13, Fourth Edition, 2007 Reissue):\n                The words of a written instrument must in general be taken in their ordinary or  \n                natural sense notwithstanding the fact that such a construction may appear not  \n                to   carry   out   the   purpose   which   it   might   otherwise   be   supposed   the   parties  \n                intended to carry out; but if the provisions and expressions are contradictory, and  \n                there are grounds, appearing on the face of the instrument, affording proof of the  \n\n\n\n\n\n                real intention of the parties, that intention will prevail against the obvious and  \n                ordinary meaning of the words; and where the literal (in the sense of ordinary,  \n                natural or primary) construction would lead to an absurd result, and the words  \n                used   are   capable   of   being   interpreted   so   as   to   avoid   this   result,   the   literal  \n                construction will be abandoned.\n\n                93.        Mr. Rohinton Nariman had very fairly submitted that it is permissible  \n                for the Court to construe the arbitration clause in a particular manner to make  \n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                      17/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                    .. 18 ..

His only caveat  \n                was that such an exercise would not permit the Court to re-write the contract. In  \n                our opinion, in the present case, the crucial line which seems to be an omission or  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                an  error   can   be   inserted   by   the   Court.   In   this   context,   we   find   support   from  \n                judgment of this Court in Shin Satellite Public Company Ltd. (supra), wherein  \n                the   &#x27;offending   part&#x27;   in   the   arbitration   clause   made   determination   by   the  \n                arbitrator final and binding between the parties and declared that the parties  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                have   waived   the   rights   to  appeal   or   an  objection   against   such   award   in  any  \n                jurisdiction. The Court, inter-alia, held that such an objectionable part is clearly  \n                severable being independent of the dispute that has to be referred to be resolved  \n                through   arbitration.   By   giving   effect   to   the   arbitration   clause,   the   court  \n                specifically noted that the &quot;it cannot be said that the Court is doing something  \n                which is not contemplated by the parties or by &#x27;interpretative process&#x27;, the Court  \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n                is rewriting the contract which is in the nature of &#x27;novation&#x27; . The intention of the  \n                parties is explicit and clear; they have agreed that the dispute, if any, would be  \n                               \n                referred to an arbitrator. To that extent, therefore, the agreement is legal, lawful  \n                and the offending part as to the finality and restraint in approaching a Court of  \n                law can be separated and severed by using a &#x27;blue pencil&#x27;.&quot;\n                              \n                94.      There is another reason which permits us to take the aforesaid view and  \n                accept the submission made by Dr. Singhvi that while construing the arbitration  \n                agreement/clause the same can be construed to make it workable, as such an  \n                approach is statutorily provided for. For this submission, Dr. Singhvi has rightly  \n                relied   upon   the   provision   contained   in   <a href=\"/doc/1151350/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections  10</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_29\">11</a>  of   the   Indian  \n      \n\n                Arbitration Act, 1996. The object of these two provisions is to avoid failure of the  \n                arbitration agreement or the arbitration clause if contained in contract. Under  \n   \n\n\n\n                <a href=\"/doc/182490/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 10(1)</a>, there is freedom given to the parties to determine the number of  \n                Arbitrators,   provided   that   such   number   shall   not   be   an   even   number.   The  \n                arbitration clause in this case provides that the arbitral tribunal shall consist of  \n                three arbitrators. Further, it must also be noticed that the Respondents have been  \n                trying   to   seek   adjudication   of   disputes   by   arbitration.   As   noted   earlier,   the  \n\n\n\n\n\n                Respondent No. 2 in its email dated 13 th  March, 2008 clearly offered that the  \n                third and the presiding arbitrator be appointed by the respective arbitrators of  \n                the   Appellants   and   the   Respondents.   On   the   other   hand,   the   attitude   of   the  \n                Appellants is to avoid arbitration at any cost.\n                95.           In this context, reliance placed by Dr. Singhvi upon  MMTC Limited \n\n\n\n\n\n                (supra) is justified. In MMTC, the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/182490/\" id=\"a_31\">Sections 10(1)</a> and (2)  \n                of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_32\">Indian Arbitration Act, 1996</a> have been held to be machinery provisions by  \n                this Court. It was further held that the validity of an arbitration agreement does  \n                not depend on the number of arbitrators specified therein. The Court declined to  \n                render the arbitration agreement invalid on the ground that it provided an even  \n                number of arbitrators. In the present case, Mr. Rohinton Nariman had rightly not  \n                even emphasised that the arbitration agreement itself is illegal. The learned sr.  \n                Counsel only emphasised that the arbitrators having expressed the view that the  \n                arbitration   clause   is   unworkable,   the   parties   ought   not   to   be   sent   to   the  \n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                      18/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                    .. 19 ..

Similarly, other provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections  8</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_34\">11</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_35\">45</a>  of the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                 Indian Arbitration Act, 1996 are machinery provisions to ensure that parties can  \n                 proceed to arbitration provided they have expressed the intention to Arbitrate.  \n                 This   intention   can   be   expressed   by   the   parties,   as   specifically   provided   under  \n                 <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_36\">Section  7</a>  of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996 by an exchange of letters, telex,  \n                 telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                 agreement. Such intention can even be expressed in the pleadings of the parties  \n                 such as statements of claim and defence, in which the existence of the agreement  \n                 is alleged by one party and not denied by the other. In view of the above, we are  \n                 of the opinion that the parties can be permitted to proceed to arbitration.&quot;\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    22.          In so far as issue raised by the respondents in the affidavit in reply \n                                \n    in arbitration application (l) No.1180 of 2014 that the named arbitrator i.e. \n    M.L. Bhakta, advocate  having recused to act as arbitrator  and thus no other \n                               \n    arbitrator can be appointed at all, learned senior counsel submits that neither \n    under   clause   31   nor   under   clause   35,     any   qualification   is   prescribed   for \n    appointment   of   an   arbitrator.

Learned   senior \n    counsel submits that there is no such provision under any of the arbitration \n    agreement  thereby barring the appointment of arbitrator in the event of the \n\n\n\n\n\n    named arbitrator refusing to act as arbitrator.

The   submission of  the  learned   counsel  for  the  respondent  that  as  the  \n                              \n                named arbitrator has refused to act as an arbitrator, the arbitration agreement  \n                itself comes to an end, cannot be accepted because <a href=\"/doc/626570/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 15</a> provides for a  \n                remedy for appointment of another arbitrator when the arbitrator appointed by  \n                the parties as provided in the agreement refuses to act an arbitrator. Settlement  \n                             \n                of  dispute   between   the   parties   through   medium   of  an   independent   person   in  \n                whom both parties repose confidence is the basic foundation on which the law of  \n                arbitration stands and is founded.   \n                18.   When   the   agreement   provides   for   reference   of   a   dispute   to   a   particular  \n      \n\n                individual and such agreed arbitrator refuses to act, the next appointment could  \n                be made as agreed by the parties, but where no such procedure is prescribed  \n                authorizing appointment of another arbitrator then the agreement clause cannot  \n   \n\n\n\n                operate. It, therefore, follows that in case where the arbitration clause provides  \n                for   appointment   of   a   sole   arbitrator   and   he   had   refused   to   act,   then   the  \n                agreement clause stands exhausted and then the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/626570/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 15</a> would  \n                be attracted and it would be for the Court under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 11(6)</a> to appoint an  \n\n\n\n\n\n                arbitrator on the procedure laid down in <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 11(6)</a> being followed unless  \n                there   is   an   agreement   in   the   contract   where   the   parties   specifically   debar  \n                appointment of any other arbitrator in case the named arbitrator refuses to act.  \n                19.  In the present case, I do not find any such stipulation in the contract entered  \n                into   between   the   parties   whereunder   the   parties   have   specifically   debarred  \n                appointment   of  a  fresh   arbitrator  if the  named  arbitrator  refuses   to  act   and  \n\n\n\n\n\n                perform   his   function   as   arbitrator.   In   the   absence   of   any   specific   condition  \n                debarring   appointment   of   a   fresh   arbitrator,   it   cannot   be   said   that   the  \n                arbitration clause in the contract agreement stands obliterated on the named  \n                arbitrator&#x27;s refusal to perform his function.&quot;\n\n     \n    23.

Vs.   Global   Cements   Ltd.\n    (2012) 7 SCC 71  in support of the aforesaid proposition.  Paragraphs 1, 2 3, \n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    5, 16 to 18 and 21 to 22 of the said judgment read thus : \n                 &quot;1. The question that falls for consideration in this case is whether on the death  \n                 of a named arbitrator, the arbitration agreement survives or not.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n                 2.   At   the   very   outset,   let   us   refer   to   the   relevant   arbitration   clause   in   the  \n                 agreement dated 16.12.1989, which reads as follows:\n                 21. If any question or difference or dispute shall arise between the parties hereto  \n                 or their representatives at any time in relation to or with respect to the meaning  \n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n                 or   effect   of   these   presents   or   with   respect   to   the   rights   and   liabilities   of   the  \n                 parties hereto then such question or dispute shall be referred either to Mr. N.A.  \n                                \n                 Palkhivala or Mr. D.S. Seth, whose decision in the matter shall be final and  \n                 binding on both the parties.\n\n                 (Emphasis added)\n                               \n                 3. The Petitioner submits that both Shri N.A. Palkhivala and Shri D.S. Seth are  \n                 no more and therefore the arbitration clause in the agreement does not survive.  \n                 It was pointed out that Shri N.A. Palkhivala was named in the agreement since  \n                 he was the Chairman of the Petitioner company and Shri D.S. Seth was named  \n      \n\n                 in the agreement since he was the Director of the company. Both of them were  \n                 nominated as arbitrators since they were closely associated with the company  \n   \n\n\n\n                 and also due to their eminence, impartiality and familiarity in all commercial  \n                 transactions   and   the   corporate   laws.   The   Petitioner   submits   that   since   the  \n                 arbitrators are no more, the arbitration clause in the agreement has no life and  \n                 hence   there   is   no   question   of   entertaining   the   application   preferred   Under  \n                 <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short &#x27;the Act&#x27;) filed  \n\n\n\n\n\n                 by the Respondent.\n                 5. Bombay High Court entertained the application preferred by the Respondent  \n                 Under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_56\">Section  11</a>  of the Act. The Court took the view that Clause 21 of the  \n                 Agreement did constitute an agreement to refer disputes to arbitration and also  \n                 took the view that in the absence of any prohibition or debarment, there is no  \n                 reason for the court to presume an intent on the part of the parties to the effect  \n\n\n\n\n\n                 that   a   vacancy   that   arises   on   account   of   a   failure   or   inability   of   a   named  \n                 arbitrator to act cannot be supplied by the court Under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_57\">Section  11</a>. The court  \n                 took the view unless the parties have expressly precluded such a course being  \n                 followed, give effect to the policy of the law, which is to promote the efficacy of  \n                 arbitration   and   the   efficacy   of   commercial   arbitration   must   be   preserved  \n                 particularly when business dealings are based on an agreement which provides  \n                 recourse to arbitration.

IC Textiles Ltd. and the learned Judge held as follows:\n                ...   It   therefore   follows   that   in   case   where   the   arbitration   clause   provides   for  \n                appointment of a sole arbitrator and he had refused to act, then the agreement  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                clause stands exhausted and then the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/626570/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 15</a> would be attracted  \n                and it would be for the court Under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 11(6)</a> to appoint an arbitrator on  \n                the   procedure   laid   down   in   <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_62\">Section  11(6)</a>  being   followed   unless   there   is   an  \n                agreement in the contract where the parties specifically debar appointment of  \n                any other arbitrator in case the named arbitrator refuses to act.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n                17.   <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_63\">Section  11(6)</a>  would   not   apply   only   if   it   is   established   that   parties   had  \n                              \n                intended not to supply the vacancy occurred due to the inability of the arbitrator  \n                to resolve the dispute or due to whatever reasons but that intention should be  \n                clearly spelt out from the terms of the arbitration clause in the Agreement.\n                             \n                18.   The   legislative   policy   embodied   in   <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_64\">Sections  14</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/626570/\" id=\"a_65\">15</a>  of   the   Act   is   to  \n                facilitate the parties to resolve the dispute by way of arbitration. The arbitration  \n                clause if clearly spells out any prohibition or debarment, the court has to keep its  \n                hands off and there is no question of persuading or pressurising the parties to  \n                resolve the dispute by a substitute arbitrator. Generally, this stands out as an  \n      \n\n                exception and that should be discernible from the language of the arbitration  \n                clause  and  the intention of  the parties.  In the  absence  of  such  debarment  or  \n   \n\n\n\n                prohibition of appointment of a substitute arbitrator, the court&#x27;s duty is to give  \n                effect to the policy of law that is to promote efficacy of arbitration.\n                21.   We   have   carefully   gone   through   the   arbitration  clause   in   the   Agreement  \n                dated 16.12.1989 and, in our view, the words &quot;at any time&quot; which appear in  \n                Clause 21, is of considerable importance. &quot;At any time&quot; expresses a time when an  \n\n\n\n\n\n                event   takes   place   expressing   a  particular   state   or   condition   that   is   when  the  \n                dispute or difference arises. The arbitration Clause 21 has no nexus with the life  \n                time   of   the   named   arbitrator.   The   expression   &quot;at   any   time&quot;   used   in   the  \n                arbitration clause has nexus only to the time frame within which the question or  \n                dispute or difference arises between the parties be resolved. Those disputes and  \n                differences could be resolved during the life time of the named arbitrators or  \n\n\n\n\n\n                beyond their life time. The incident of the death of the named arbitrators has no  \n                nexus  or  linkage  with  the expression &quot;at  any  time&quot; used  in Clause  21 of  the  \n                Agreement.   The   time   factor   mentioned   therein   is   the   time   within   which   the  \n                question   or   dispute   or   difference   between   the   parties   is   resolved   as   per   the  \n                Agreement. Arbitration clause would have life so long as any question or dispute  \n                or difference between the parties exists unless the language of the clause clearly  \n                expresses an intention to the contrary.

The   following   principles   relevant   to   the   present   case   emerge   from   the  \n                 aforesaid discussion : (1) An arbitration clause is a collateral term of a contract  \n                 as distinguished from its substantive terms; but none the less it is an integral part  \n                 of it; (2) however comprehensive the terms of an arbitration clause may be, the  \n                 existence of the contract is a necessary condition for its operation; it perishes with  \n                 the contract; (3) the contract may be non est in the sense that it never came  \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n                 legally into existence or it was void ab initio; (4) though the contract was validly  \n                 executed, the parties may put an end to it as if it had never existed and substitute  \n                                \n                 a new contract for it solely governing their rights and liabilities thereunder; (5)  \n                 in the former case, if the original contract has no legal existence, the arbitration  \n                 clause also cannot operate, for along with the original contract, it is also void; in  \n                               \n                 the latter case, as the original contract is extinguished by the substituted one, the  \n                 arbitration clause of the original contract perishes with it; and (6) between the  \n                 two falls many categories of disputes in connection with a contract, such as the  \n                 question   of   repudiation,   frustration,   breach   etc.   In   those   cases   it   is   the  \n                 performance of the contract that has come to an end, but the contract is still in  \n                 existence   for   certain   purposes   in   respect   of   disputes  arising   under   it   or   in  \n      \n\n\n                 connection with it. As the contract subsists for certain purposes, the arbitration  \n                 clause operates in respect of these purposes.&quot;\n   \n\n\n\n    29.          Mr   D&#x27;vitre,   learned   senior   counsel   placed   reliance   on   the \n\n\n\n\n\n    Judgment in case of  Young Achievers Vs. IMS Learning Resources Pvt. Ltd. \n    2013(12) SCC 535 and in particular paragraph 2, 5 and 7 and submits that \n    since the alleged agreement does not exist,  arbitration agreement alleged to \n    be   forming   part   of   such   non   existent   agreement   also   does   not   exist. \n\n\n\n\n\n    Paragraphs 2, 5 and 7of the Judgment of the SC in case of    read thus . \n                2.

An  \n      \n\n                arbitration   clause   in   an   agreement   cannot   survive   if   the   agreement   containing  \n                arbitration   clause   has   been   superseded/novated   by   a   later   agreement.   The  \n                agreement dated 01.04.2010 contained the following arbitration clause:\n   \n\n\n\n                       20.

The   arbitration   shall   be   governed   by   the  \n                       provisions   of   the   <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_66\">Arbitration   and   Conciliation   Act,   1996</a>   or   any   other  \n                       statutory modification or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force  \n                       and award or awards of such arbitrator shall be binding on all the parties to  \n\n\n\n\n\n                       the said dispute.\n\n                7.   The exit paper would clearly indicate that it is a mutually agreed document  \n                containing comprehensive terms and conditions which -admittedly does not contain  \n                an arbitration clause. We are of the view that the High Court is right in taking the  \n                view that in the case on hand, is not a case involving assertion by the Respondent  \n                of accord a satisfaction in respect of the earlier contracts dated 01.04.2007 and  \n                01.04.2010.

Kishorilal Gupta and Bros. \n                MANU/SC/0180/1959: AIR 1959 SC 1362. This Court in Kishorilal Gupta&#x27;s case  \n                (supra) examined the question whether an arbitration clause can be invoked in the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                case of a dispute under a superseded contract. The principle laid down is that if the  \n                contract is superseded by another, the arbitration clause, being a component part  \n                of the earlier contract, falls with it. But where the dispute is whether such contract  \n                is void ab intio, the arbitration clause cannot operate on those disputes, for its  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n                operative force depends upon the existence  of the contract  and its validity. The  \n                various   other   observations   were   made   by   this   Court   in   the   above-mentioned  \n                judgment in respect of &quot;settlement of disputes arising under the original contract,  \n                including   the   dispute   as   to   the   breach   of   the   contract   and   its   consequences&quot;.  \n                Principle laid down by the House of Lords in  Heyman  v.

Issue   of   arbitrability   can   be \n    considered   in   this   application   even   at   this   stage.     Learned   senior   counsel \n                                 \n    placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in case of Booz Allen  \n    and Hamilton Inc. vs. SBI Home Finance Limited and others (2011) 5 SCC  \n                                \n    532 and in particular paragraphs 32 to 38, 44 and 46, 49 to 51 and 53 which \n    reads thus :-\n                32.       The nature and scope of issues arising for consideration in an application  \n      \n\n\n                under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 11</a> of the Act for appointment of arbitrators, are far narrower than  \n                those arising in an application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8</a> of the Act, seeking reference of the  \n   \n\n\n\n                parties to a suit to arbitration. While considering an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 11</a> \n                of   the   Act,   the   Chief   Justice   or   his   designate   would   not   embark   upon   an  \n                examination of the issue of &#x27;arbitrability&#x27; or appropriateness of adjudication by a  \n                private forum, once he finds that there was an arbitration agreement between or  \n                among the parties, and would leave the issue of arbitrability for the decision of the  \n\n\n\n\n\n                arbitral Tribunal. If the arbitrator wrongly holds that the dispute is arbitrable, the  \n                aggrieved party will have to challenge the award by filing an application under  \n                <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 34</a> of the Act, relying upon Sub-<a href=\"/doc/85288767/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 2(b)(i)</a> of that section. \n\n\n                33.     But where the issue of &#x27;arbitrability&#x27; arises in the context of an application  \n\n\n\n\n\n                under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 8</a> of the Act in a pending suit, all aspects of arbitrability have to be  \n                decided by the court seized of the suit, and cannot be left to the decision of the  \n                Arbitrator. Even if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties, and even  \n                if the dispute is covered by the arbitration agreement, the court where the civil suit  \n                is pending, will refuse an application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 8</a> of the Act, to refer the parties  \n                to arbitration, if the subject matter of the suit is capable of adjudication only by a  \n                public   forum   or   the   relief   claimed   can   only   be   granted   by   a   special   court   or  \n                Tribunal.\n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                       29/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                     .. 30 ..

The term &#x27;arbitrability&#x27; has different meanings in different contexts. The  \n                three facets of arbitrability, relating to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, are  \n                as under:\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        \n                  (i)   whether   the   disputes   are   capable   of   adjudication   and   settlement   by  \n                  arbitration? That is, whether the disputes, having regard to their nature, could  \n                  be resolved by a private forum chosen by the parties (the arbitral tribunal) or  \n                  whether they would exclusively fall within the domain of public fora (courts). \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n                  (ii)  Whether  the  disputes  are   covered   by the  arbitration  agreement?  That   is,  \n                  whether the disputes are enumerated or described in the arbitration agreement  \n                  as matters to be decided by arbitration or whether the disputes fall under the  \n                  &#x27;excepted matters&#x27; excluded from the purview of the arbitration agreement. \n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n                  (iii)   Whether   the   parties   have   referred   the   disputes   to   arbitration?   That   is,  \n                  whether   the   disputes   fall   under   the   scope   of   the   submission   to   the   arbitral  \n                  tribunal, or whether they do not arise out of the statement of claim and the  \n                                \n                  counter claim filed before the arbitral tribunal. A dispute, even if it is capable of  \n                  being   decided   by   arbitration   and   falling   within   the   scope   of   arbitration  \n                  agreement,   will  not   be   &#x27;arbitrable&#x27;  if  it  is  not   enumerated   in  the  joint  list   of  \n                               \n                  disputes referred to arbitration, or in the absence of such joint list of disputes,  \n                  does not form part of the disputes raised in the pleadings before the arbitral  \n                  tribunal.\n                35.     The Arbitral tribunals are private fora chosen voluntarily by the parties to  \n                the dispute, to adjudicate their disputes in place of courts and tribunals which are  \n      \n\n\n                public fora constituted under the laws of the country. Every civil or commercial  \n                dispute, either contractual or non-contractual, which can be decided by a court, is  \n   \n\n\n\n                in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved by arbitration unless the  \n                jurisdiction   of   arbitral   tribunals   is   excluded   either   expressly   or   by   necessary  \n                implication. Adjudication of certain categories of proceedings are reserved by the  \n                Legislature exclusively for public fora as a matter of public policy. Certain other  \n                categories of cases, though not expressly reserved for adjudication by a public fora  \n\n\n\n\n\n                (courts   and   Tribunals),   may   by   necessary   implication   stand   excluded   from   the  \n                purview of private fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is inarbitrable, the  \n                court where a suit is pending, will refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, under  \n                <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 8</a> of the Act, even if the parties might have agreed upon arbitration as the  \n                forum for settlement of such disputes. \n\n\n\n\n\n                36.       The well-recognized examples of non-arbitrable disputes are: (i) disputes  \n                relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences;  \n                (ii)   matrimonial   disputes   relating   to   divorce,   judicial   separation,   restitution   of  \n                conjugal   rights,   child   custody;   (iii)   guardianship   matters;   (iv)   insolvency   and  \n                winding   up   matters;   (v)   testamentary   matters   (grant   of   probate,   letters   of  \n                administration  and   succession certificate); and   (vi)  eviction  or  tenancy  matters  \n                governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against  \n                eviction and only the specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or  \n                decide the disputes.\n\n\n    Asmita                                                                                                      30/45\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 28/08/2014 23:49:04 :::\n                                                      .. 31 ..

It may be noticed that the cases referred to above relate to actions in rem. A  \n                right in rem is a right exercisable against the world at large, as contrasted from a  \n                right in personam which is an interest protected solely against specific individuals.  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n                Actions in personam refer to actions determining the rights and interests of the  \n                parties themselves in the subject matter of the case, whereas actions in rem refer to  \n                actions determining the title to property and the rights of the parties, not merely  \n                among themselves but also against all persons at any time claiming an interest in  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n                that   property.   Correspondingly,   judgment   in   personam   refers   to   a   judgment  \n                against a person as distinguished from a judgment against a thing, right or status  \n                and judgment in rem refers to a judgment that determines the status or condition  \n                of   property   which   operates   directly   on   the   property   itself.

Generally and traditionally all disputes relating to rights in personam are  \n                                 \n                considered to be amenable to arbitration; and all disputes relating to rights in rem  \n                are required to be adjudicated by courts and public tribunals, being unsuited for  \n                private arbitration. This is not however a rigid or inflexible rule. Disputes relating  \n                to sub-ordinate rights in personam arising from rights in rem have always been  \n                                \n                considered to be arbitrable.\n\n\n                44.

Further, as pointed in the Calcutta case, merely because there is need for  \n                  exercise of discretion in case of specific performance, it cannot be said that only  \n                  the civil court can exercise such a discretion.

A decree for sale of a mortgaged property as in the case of a decree for  \n   \n\n\n\n                order of winding up, requires the court to protect the interests of persons other  \n                than  the   parties   to   the   suit/petition  and   empowers   the   court   to  entertain  and  \n                adjudicate upon rights and liabilities of third parties (other than those who are  \n                parties   to  the   arbitration   agreement).   Therefore,   a   suit   for   sale,   foreclosure   or  \n                redemption of a mortgaged property, should only be tried by a public forum, and  \n\n\n\n\n\n                not   by   an   arbitral   tribunal.   Consequently,   it   follows   that   the   court   where   the  \n                mortgage suit is pending, should not refer the parties to arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">                50.     The Appellant contended that the suit ultimately raises the following core  \n                issues,   which   can   be   decided   by  a   private   forum:  (i)   Whether   there   is   a   valid  \n                mortgage or charge in favor of SBI?

It was submitted that merely because mortgage suits  \n                involve passing of preliminary decrees and final decrees, they do not get excluded  \n                from arbitrable disputes. It is pointed out that the arbitral tribunals can also make  \n                interim   awards   deciding   certain   aspects   of   the   disputes   finally   which   can   be  \n                equated to preliminary decrees granted by courts, and the final award made by the  \n                arbitrator, after detailed accounting etc. could be compared to the final decree by  \n                courts.

It is not the case of the respondents that there was any other \n    agreement other than the agreement dated 25/03/1997.  In my view, there is \n      \n\n\n    thus no substance in the submission of the learned senior counsel appearing \n   \n\n\n\n    for   the   respondents   that   the   agreement   referred   by   the   applicants   in   the \n    notice   invoking   arbitration   agreement   and   in   the   arbitration   application, \n    does not exist or that the arbitration agreement does not exist or that the \n\n\n\n\n\n    arbitration   application   No.107   of   2012   is   not   maintainable.
