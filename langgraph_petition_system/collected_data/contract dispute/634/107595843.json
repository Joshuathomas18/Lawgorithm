We now turn to the merits of the controversy. The Tribunal\n      took the view that the dispute regarding retirement age of Shibban\n      Lal ceased to be an industrial dispute because of the settlement\n      dated June 9, 1965 and, therefore, it could not be referred to it for\n      adjudication.

The plain reading of the rule and the Form, according to the\n   appellant, clearly suggests its mandatory character. It was\n   contended that the settlement was not entered into with the\n   concurrence of he Conciliation Officer nor was it entered during the\n   conciliation proceedings. Particular emphasis was laid on\n   noncompliance with sub-rule (4). The settlement, in the\n   circumstances, was urged to be invalid and the reference of the\n   dispute quite in accordance with law. In this connection the learned\n   advocate referred to<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_28\"> s. 18</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 which\n   is as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">           &quot;18.

The decision in <a href=\"/doc/910013/\" id=\"a_30\">The Bata Shoe Co. (P) Ltd. v. D. N. Ganguly</a> was\n      cited in support of the submission that a settlement during the\n      conciliation proceedings to be binding must be arrived at with the\n      assistance and concurrence of the Conciliation Officer.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">      14. The respondent&#x27;s learned Advocate in reply obliquely suggested\n      in this connection that the Management and the Union were free to\n      arrive at a settlement of their dispute and if they agreed to do so\n      then the agreement could not but be held to be binding. We do not\n      think the Management and the Union can, when a dispute is\n      referred to the Conciliation Officer, claim absolute freedom of\n      contract to arrive at a settlement in all respects binding on all\n      workmen, to which no objection whatsoever can ever be raised by\n      the workmen feeling aggrieved. The question of a valid and binding\n      settlement in such circumstances, is in our opinion, governed by\n      the statute and the rules made thereunder. Reliance was next\n      placed on<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_31\"> s.18(1)</a> to support the binding character of the\n      settlement. This sub-section for its pro- per construction must be\n      read with the other sub-sections and the relevant rules, in the light\n      of the definition of &#x27;settlement&#x27; as contained in<a href=\"/doc/79553943/\" id=\"a_32\"> s. 2(p)</a> of the\n      Industrial Disputes Act. &#x27;Settlement&#x27; as defined therein means\n      settlement arrived at in the course of conciliation proceeding and\n      includes a written agreement between the employer and workmen\n      arrived at otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceeding\n      where such agreement has been signed by the parties thereto in\n      such manner as may be prescribed and a copy thereof has been\n      sent to the appropriate Government and the Conciliation Officer. In\n      the light of these provisions we do not think that<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_33\"> s.18</a>(1 ) vests in\n      the Management and the Union unfettered freedom to settle the\n      dispute as they please and clothe it with a binding effect on all\n      workmen or even on all member workmen of the Union. The\n      settlement has to be in compliance with the statutory provisions.&quot;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1238559\" id=\"span_109\">(ii) the judgment rendered in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1238559/\" id=\"a_34\">Brooke Bond India\n\nLtd Vs.

But, as pointed out by the Tribunal rule 62\n   only prescribes the form of the memorandum of settlement and by\n   whom it should be signed, and the question whether the procedure\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                             Page 44 of 76</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                                    Downloaded on : Tue Jul 30 22:54:56 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\nC/SCA/5707/2014                               JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2024\n\n                                                                                undefined\n\n\n\n\n   prescribed by rule 62 has been complied with will arise only if there\n   is in existence a valid settlement between the parties concerned. In\n   this case it has been found that the office bearers who signed the\n   agreement were not competent to enter into a settlement with the\n   company and as such it cannot be said that an agreement was\n   reached between the employer and the workmen represented by\n   the Rashtriya Union. What is binding as a settlement under <a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_40\">section\n   18 (1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act is an agreement between the\n   employer and workmen. Here the Tribunal found that there was no\n   agreement between management and the Rashtriya Union.\n   Reliance was placed on behalf of the appellant on the decision of\n   this Court in Workmen of M/s. <a href=\"/doc/269695/\" id=\"a_41\">Delhi Cloth and General Mills v.\n   Management</a> of M/s. Delhi Cloth and General Mills.(1) In that case\n   among other matters rule 58 of the Industrial Disputes (Central)\n   Rules, 1957 made under <a href=\"/doc/1295761/\" id=\"a_42\">section 38</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act,\n   1947 came up for consideration. Rule 58(2)(b) of the Central Rules\n   which is similar to rule 62 (2) (b) of the Bombay Rules reads:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">   &quot;58.

It is not clear why this decision was considered\n   relevant. Possibly this case was referred to for the observation\n   occurring on page 897 of the report: &quot;We may observe here that we\n   were not impressed by the appellant&#x27;s argument that r. 58 sub-rule\n   (2) (b) required that the officer of a trade union of workmen must\n   also be duly authorised. We, however, do not express any\n   considered opinion in view of our conclusion on other points&quot;.\n   Reference to this observation may have been intended as a reply to\n   the construction sought to be put on rule 62 (2) (b) of the Bombay\n   Rules on behalf of the Rashtriya Union that the words &quot;duly\n   authorised&quot; applied not only to the five representatives of\n   workmen&quot; but also to the office bearers mentioned in the rule to\n   enable them to sign the settlement; on such construction it was\n   contended that the office bearers of the Union who signed the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                             Page 45 of 76</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                   Downloaded on : Tue Jul 30 22:54:56 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                    NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\nC/SCA/5707/2014                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2024\n\n                                                                                    undefined\n\n\n\n\n   agreement were not specifically authorised to do so. This\n   construction of rule 62 (2) (b) was rightly rejected by the Tribunal.\n   But neither rule 58 of the Central Rules nor rule 62 of the Bombay\n   Rules contains anything to suggest that any officer of a trade union\n   who is entitled to sign a settlement must be deemed to have had\n   the authority to enter into this settlement. The procedure\n   prescribed by either rule 58 of the Central Rules or rule 62 of the\n   Bombay Rules presupposes the existence of a valid settlement, and\n   the question in this case is whether there was such a settlement.\n   Another case relied on by the appellant is <a href=\"/doc/1148750/\" id=\"a_44\">The Sirsilk Ltd. and others\n   v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and another</a>.(1) The facts of that\n   case are that after the proceedings before the Tribunal had come to\n   an end and the Tribunal had sent its award to government the\n   parties concerned in the dispute came to a settlement. <a href=\"/doc/1905977/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 17\n   (1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act lays down that every award shall\n   within a period of thirty days from the date of its receipt by the\n   appropriate government be published in such manner as the\n   appropriate government thinks fit. <a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 18 (1)</a> makes a\n   settlement arrived at between the employer and workmen\n   otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceedings binding on\n   the parties to the agreement.

This Court held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">           &quot;The only way in our view to resolve the possible conflict\n           which would arise between a settlement which is binding\n           under<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_49\"> s. 18 (1)</a> and an award which may become binding\n           under<a href=\"/doc/902131/\" id=\"a_50\"> s. 18 (3)</a> on publication is to withhold the publication of\n           the award once the Government has been informed jointly by\n           the parties that a settlement binding under<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_51\"> s. 18 (1)</a> has\n           been arrived at.. In such a situation we are of opinion that\n           the government ought not to publish the award under<a href=\"/doc/1905977/\" id=\"a_52\"> s. 17\n           (1)</a> and in cases where government is going to publish it, it\n           can be directed not to publish the award in view of the\n           binding settlement arrived at between the parties under<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_53\"> s. 18\n           (1)</a> with respect to the very matters which were the subject\n           matter of adjudication under the award.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">   We think this decision was relied on only to emphasize that a\n   settlement reached between the parties concerned in the dispute\n   must prevail if it is reached at any time before the publication of the\n   award.

Other\n   questions will arise only after it is found that there was such a\n   settlement in existence. Sirsilk does not therefore afford any\n   assistance to the appellant. The tribunal in support of the view\n   taken by it relied on a decision of the Delhi High Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"689768\" id=\"span_121\">In <a href=\"/doc/689768/\" id=\"a_55\">Hindustan\n   Housing Factory Ltd. v.

But, where the Constitution does\n   not so provide specifically, the officer-bearer or bearers who wish to\n   enter into a settlement with the employer should have the\n   necessary authorisation by the executive committee of the Union or\n   by the workmen. A reading of rule 58 clearly shows that it\n   presupposes the existence of a settlement already arrived at\n   between the employer and the workmen, and it only prescribes the\n   from in which the Memorandum of settlement should be, and by\n   whom it should be signed. It does not deal with the entering into or\n   arriving at a settlement. Therefore, where a settlement is alleged to\n   have been arrived at between an employer and one or more office-\n   bearers of the Union, and the authority of the office-bearers who\n   signed the Memorandum of settlement to enter into the settlement\n   is challenged or disputed, the said authority or authorisation of the\n   office-bearers who signed the Memorandum of settlement has to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                              Page 47 of 76</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                    Downloaded on : Tue Jul 30 22:54:56 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                    NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n   C/SCA/5707/2014                                JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2024\n\n                                                                                    undefined\n\n\n\n\n      established as a fact, and it is not enough if the employer merely\n      points out and relies upon the fact that the Memorandum of\n      settlement was signed by one or more of the office-bearers of the\n      Union.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">      In our opinion the above extract from the judgment of the Delhi\n      High Court states correctly the law on the point.

A\n   settlement which belongs to the first category has limited\n   application in that it merely binds the parties to the agreement but\n   the settlement be- longing to the second category has extended\n   application since it is binding on all parties to the industrial dispute,\n   to all others who were summoned to appear in the conciliation\n   proceedings and to all persons employed in the establishment or\n   part of the establishment, as the case may be, to which the dispute\n   related on the date of the dispute and to all others who joined the\n   establishment thereafter. Therefore, a settlement arrived at in the\n   course of conciliation proceedings with a recognised majority union\n   will be binding on all workmen of the establishment, even those\n   who belong to the minority union which had objected to the same.\n   To that extent it departs from the ordinary law of contract. The\n   object obviously is to uphold the sanctity of settlements reached\n   with the active assistance of the Conciliation Officer and to\n   discourage an individual employee or a minority union from\n   scuttling the settlement. There is an underlying assumption that a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                               Page 51 of 76</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                      Downloaded on : Tue Jul 30 22:54:56 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                   NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n   C/SCA/5707/2014                               JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2024\n\n                                                                                   undefined\n\n\n\n\n      settlement reached with the help of the Conciliation Officer must be\n      fair and reasonable and can, therefore, safely be made binding not\n      only on the workmen belonging to the Union signing the settlement\n      but also on others. That is why a settlement arrived at in the course\n      of conciliation proceedings is put on par with an award made by an\n      adjudicatory authority. The High Court was, therefore, right in\n      coming to the conclusion that the settlement dated 4 th August,\n      1983 was binding on all the work- men of the Barauni Refinery\n      including the members of Petroleum and Chemical Mazdoor Union.&quot;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1757798\" id=\"span_134\">(ii) the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1757798/\" id=\"a_77\">The Jhagrakhan Collieries                  (P) Ltd.

It is clear from a perusal of <a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 18</a>, that a settlement\n      arrived at in the course of conciliation proceedings is binding not\n      only on the actual parties to the industrial dispute but also on the\n      heirs, successors or assigns of the employer on the one hand, and\n      all the workmen in the establishment, present or future, on the\n      other. In extending the operation of such a settlement beyond the\n      parties thereto, sub-section (3) of the Section departs from the\n      ordinary law of contract and gives effect to the principle of\n      collective bargaining. Thus, had Mr. B. D. Sharma been a duly\n      appointed Conciliation Officer, the settlement arrived at in the\n      conciliation proceedings, duly conducted by him under <a href=\"/doc/1570927/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 12</a>,\n      would have been binding on the entire body of the workers\n      including Respondents 4 to 173 represented by the Federation. and\n      others who &#x27;are members of the Sabha. Since the finding of the\n      High Court to the effect that the settlement between the Panchayat\n      and the management cannot be deemed to be settlement arrived\n      at in the course of conciliation proceedings under the Act, now\n      stands unassailed. the aforesaid sub-section (3) cannot be invoked\n      to make it binding on Respondents 4 to 173.

Even Mr. Malhotra has conceded that at the time when the\n      settlement was arrived at on October 22, 1969, these respondents\n      and the members of the Sabha. were not Parties to it. But his\n      argument is that subsequently by drawing V.D.A. in accordance\n      with the settlement, 99% of the workers have accepted the\n      settlement which, in consequence, would be as effective against\n      them as if they were parties to it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">      17. The refusal of the Labour Court to allow the appellant to lead\n      evidence at this stage, has not caused any prejudice to the\n      appellant. The issue decided as a preliminary issue involved a\n      question of law which could be decided on the, basis of material on\n      record. For its it was not necessary to prove that 99% of the\n      workers had accepted the agreement dated October 22, 1969. Even\n      on an assumption of that fact in favour of the Company, the claim\n      before the Labour Court could not be deemed to have been settled\n      qua respondents 4 to 173.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">[E] The settlement in the present case is unfair, unjust,\n\nunreasonable, fraudulent, based on misrepresentation and\n\nconcealment of facts and to subvert the award passed by the\n\nIndustrial Tribunal and hence, the present applicants may be\n\njoined as parties as prayed in the Civil Application and may be\n\npermitted to contest the petitions in their personal capacity.\n\n\n\n[F] When the settlement i.e. MOS dated 07.06.2024 is\n\nadmittedly<a href=\"/doc/509428/\" id=\"a_80\"> u/s 18(1)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, the present\n\npending proceedings are required to be adjudicated on merits\n\nwith respect to the challenge of the award passed by the\n\nIndustrial Tribunal, by this Hon&#x27;ble Court and as the applicants\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                Page 53 of 76</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                      Downloaded on : Tue Jul 30 22:54:56 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                      NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n     C/SCA/5707/2014                                JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2024\n\n                                                                                      undefined\n\n\n\n\nare not at all concerned with the said settlement, there is no\n\npurpose of examining the validity of the said settlement by the\n\nIndustrial Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">\n\n8.3     Lastly, learned advocate Ms.Shah has submitted that,\n\npending these petitions, let this issue be referred to the\n\nIndustrial Tribunal for its genuineness and legality and after\n\nleading the evidence and after examining the witnesses, let\n\nthe Tribunal pass an appropriate order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_114\">9.

So far as the parties are concerned there will be\n               uncertainty with regard to the result of the litigation in a court\n               proceeding. When, therefore, negotiations take place which\n               have to be encouraged, particularly between labour and\n               employer in the interest of general peace and well-being, there\n               is always give and take. Having regard to the nature of the\n               dispute, which was raised as far back as 1968, the very fact of\n               the existence of a litigation with regard to the same matter\n               which was bound to take some time must have influenced both\n               the parties to come to some settlement.

In our view such a package deal entered into by\n                 Respondent 2 in the best interest of these workmen\n                 could not be said to be unfair or unjust from any angle.\n                 On the contrary, if the back wages were given to them, then the\n                 remaining workmen against whom there was no disciplinary\n                 action or any alleged misconduct and who had also lost wages\n                 for 12 months only because they were in sympathy with these\n                 29 dismissed workmen would have stood discriminated against.\n                 Consequently, it is not possible to agree with the learned\n                 counsel for Respondents 3 to 14 that the said settlement was in\n                 any way unfair or unjust. Once this condition is reached it is\n                 obvious that the entire industrial dispute should have been\n                 disposed of in the light of this settlement and an award in terms\n                 of the settlement should have been passed by the first\n                 respondent-Court in the case of Respondents 3 to 14 also.\n                 Consequently, the judgment and order of the Division Bench of\n                 the High Court dated 4-4-1995 and the order of the learned\n                 Single Judge dated 29-9-1993 are quashed and set aside.
