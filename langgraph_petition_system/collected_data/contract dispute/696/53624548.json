The employee is the one who works for another for hire or\n                   reward. The employment is the contract of service between the\n                   employer and the employee whereunder the employee agrees to serve\n                   the employer subject to the employer‟s control and supervision.

It was\n                   a case where the respondent company employed the petitioner initially\n                   under an employment agreement and later on, he was designated as\n                   partner with a minor share in the firm. It appears that owing to certain\n                   omissions and commissions on the part of the petitioner, an inquiry\n                   was initiated against him, upon which the petitioner filed a\n                   Commercial Arbitration Application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 9</a> of the\n                   Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which came to be dismissed\n                   by the learned Commercial Court on the ground that the dispute raised\n                   was not a commercial dispute. The facts in the above noted case were\n                   similar to the present one inasmuch as services of the petitioner were\n                   terminated by the respondent company and the suit instituted under\n                   the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_62\">CC Act</a> was held to be not maintainable.

This in effect would defeat\n                              the very reason why the commercial Court was constituted. The\n                              view of mine, in this regard, is fortified by the judgment of the\n                              Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/129071287/\" id=\"a_64\">AMBALAL SARABHAI\n                              ENTERPRISES LTD.

At the outset, it is noticed that the consideration\n                                  required in the instant case is as to whether the transaction\n                                  between the parties herein which is the subject-matter of\n                                  the suit could be considered as a &quot;commercial dispute&quot; so\n                                  as to enable the Commercial Court to entertain the suit. In\n                                  that regard, it is necessary to take note of <a href=\"/doc/48758920/\" id=\"a_66\">Section\n                                  2(1)(c)(vii)</a> of the CC Act, 2015.

The learned Senior Advocate for the appellant\n                                    would however, contend that a strict interpretation as in\n                                    the case of taxing statutes would not be appropriate in the\n                                    instant case where the issue relates to jurisdiction. In that\n                                    regard, the learned Senior Advocate has referred to the\n                                    Statement of Objects and Reasons with which the\n                                    <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_92\">Commercial Courts Act, 2015</a> is enacted so as to provide\n                                    speedy disposal of high value commercial disputes so as to\n                                    create the positive image to the investors world about the\n                                    independent and responsive Indian legal system. Hence,\n                                    he contends that a purposive interpretation be made. It is\n                                    contended that a wider purport and meaning is to be\n                                    assigned while entertaining the suit and considering the\n                                    dispute to be a commercial dispute. Having taken note of\n                                    the submission we feel that the very purpose for which the\n                                    <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_93\">CC Act</a> of 2015 has been enacted would be defeated if\n                                    every other suit merely because it is filed before the\n                                    Commercial Court is entertained. This is for the reason\n                                    that the suits which are not actually relating to commercial\n                                    dispute but being filed merely because of the high value\n                                    and with the intention of seeking early disposal would\n                                    only clog the system and block the way for the genuine\n                                    commercial disputes which may have to be entertained by\n                                    the Commercial Courts as intended by the lawmakers. In\n                                    commercial disputes as defined a special procedure is\n                                    provided for a class of litigation and a strict procedure will\n                                    have to be followed to entertain only that class of litigation\n                                    in that jurisdiction. If the same is strictly interpreted it is\n                                    not as if those excluded will be non-suited without any\n                                    remedy. The excluded class of litigation will in any event\n                                    be entertained in the ordinary civil courts wherein the\n                                    remedy has always existed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">                                        14.

In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court finds that the\n                   impugned order dated 21.12.2023 passed by the learned Trial Court\n                   dismissing the application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_95\">Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC</a> does\n                   not suffer from any illegality, perversity or incorrect approach in law.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                        C.R.P 31/2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Digitally Signed By:PRAMOD                                                                Page 33 of 34</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">KUMAR VATS\nSigning Date:28.05.2024\n19:40:34\n                    Much mileage was sought to be taken by the learned counsel for the\n                   petitioner to the high value attached to the contract between the parties\n                   in the instant matter. The said aspect does not cut any ice. Merely\n                   because a contract of personal service or employment may have some\n                   attributes of being high value or have high stakes therein, as in the\n                   instant case, that by itself would not be sufficient so as to bring any\n                   dispute arising out of such contract within the scope and ambit of a\n                   commercial dispute.          Merely because a contract of service also\n                   involves payment, remuneration and several other service perks or\n                   peculiar benefits, that alone would not be a decisive factor in holding\n                   it to be a commercial dispute. Unhesitatingly, this Court finds that a\n                   contract of service that requires rendering of personal services by one\n                   of the parties to another, is purely and simply a service dispute\n                   governed by the Service Law jurisprudence and the Common Law, for\n                   which remedy lies elsewhere. There is no doubt in the mind of this\n                   Court that the legislature never intended to bring a contract for the\n                   purpose of rendering personal services of an executive or\n                   administrative nature within the scope and ambit of the <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_96\">CC Act</a>. In\n                   essence, intra-departmental disputes between the employer and\n                   employee of an organization are outside the purview of the <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_97\">CC Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">                   25.
