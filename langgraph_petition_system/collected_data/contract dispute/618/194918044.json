On\n\n09.03.2021, the third respondent issued e-tender notice inviting\n\ncomposite bids in two bids system from eligible contractors for\n\nconstruction of capital complex (Civil Secretariat Component) at\n\nMantripukhri, Imphal (balance work). Pursuant to the said notice,\n\nthe petitioner participated in the e-tender process. The petitioner,\n\nbeing the lowest bidder having fulfilled all terms and conditions of\n\nthe tender, allotted the said work. The third applicant/respondent\n\nissued an acceptance letter dated 27.05.2021 awarding the said\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                            Page 3\n work      to   the     petitioner   at   the   negotiated   amount     of     Rs.\n\n1,67,40,96,700/- which is inclusive of 12% GST of civil works, 18%\n\nGST for IEL works and 15 labourcess which is 2% reduction from\n\nthe originally quoted amount of Rs. 170,82,61,939.22. In the said\n\nletter,    the       respondent/petitioner      was   required   to    submit\n\nperformance guarantee of Rs. 5,02,22,901/- amounting to 3% the\n\ntendered value of the work. The petitioner had also executed the\n\nperformance security bank guarantee for the said amount in favour\n\nof the third applicant/respondent. Pursuant to the acceptance for\n\nthe work order and letter of acceptance, an agreement dated\n\n08.06.2021 was executed between the respondent/petitioner and\n\nthe third applicants/respondents and the period for completion of\n\nwork was fixed as 12 months (02.06.2021 to 01.06.2022). The\n\npetitioner executed 17 bank guarantees in favour of the third\n\napplicants/respondents and the same was also communicated to the\n\napplicants/respondents. According to the regulations, the site must\n\nbe     handed        over    with    complete     construction-ready        plans\n\nencompassing the tendered scope of project. The work was initially\n\nawarded to M/s Simplex Projects Limited in October, 2010.\n\nHowever, the said company was not able to complete the project\n\nwithin the stipulated period and, therefore, the contract was\n\nterminated on 02.11.2019. Thereafter, the applicants/respondents\n\nissued notice inviting tender on 28.12.2019, which was challenged\n\nby M/s. Simplex Projects Limited, which went to filing of WA No. 39\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                               Page 4\n of 2020 and, this Court, on 13.01.2021, directed the parties to have\n\na final joint measurement and after completion of the joint\n\nmeasurement, liberty was given to the applicants/respondents State\n\nto proceed with construction of the Civil Secretariat Complex by\n\nfollowing the required formalities and procedures. Thereafter, the\n\nremaining work was awarded to the respondent/petitioner.\n\n[4]            The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner\n\nsubmitted that the respondent/petitioner was compelled to execute\n\nthe work in compliance with the modifications and enhancements\n\nmade to the specifications and branding from multiple perspectives\n\nleading to delays and missed milestones. In fact, the department\n\ndisposed of numerous profitable products, for example CCTV, data\n\nnetwork system and the aforesaid changes necessitated a re-\n\nthinking of the department&#x27;s strategies, which had to be adjusted to\n\naccommodate the changing environment. The learned counsel\n\nwould further submit that the site was handed over in a deplorable\n\ncondition with a great deal of thick jungle and debris and in a\n\ndisorderly fashion. The removal and correction works caused huge\n\namount of money and time to the respondent/petitioner and the\n\nsaid   extra   work   amount   has   not   yet   been   paid   to   the\n\nrespondent/petitioner till date. He further submitted that the work\n\nwas awarded during pre and post-first Covid eras and the work did\n\nnot begin until after Covid pandemic was under control. When the\n\nrespondent/petitioner decided to re-start the work, the second wave\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                       Page 5\n began and the respondent/petitioner was not able to start the work\n\nand, in fact, the respondent/petitioner wrote several letters to the\n\napplicants/respondents stating Covid issues, he further submitted\n\nthat as instructed by the Department concerned, number of extra\n\nitems have been completed at the site and, in this regard, the\n\nrespondent/petitioner had submitted a detailed estimate during\n\nSeptember, 2021. After deliberation and reviews by various\n\ndepartmental personnel, the department approved certain items,\n\nleaving around sixty items pending for approval.\n\n[5]          The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner\n\nsubmitted further that the respondent/petitioner had problems in\n\nprocuring the granite of particular colour and after addressing\n\nseveral    letters    to      the     applicants/respondents,        the\n\napplicants/respondents     approved   the   substitute   colour.     The\n\nrespondent/petitioner had also submitted TDS and rate analysis for\n\nvarious civil and MEP extra items and change of specification\n\nsubstitute items, which was also discussed. That apart, the\n\nrespondent/petitioner had various problems qua UPVC windows, SS\n\nrailing, tiles, lifts, DG set, street lamp post, sanitary works, STP\n\nfunctions and landscape design which contributed to further delay in\n\ncompletion of the work and the applicants/respondents officials are\n\nlethargic in solving the said problems. The learned counsel added\n\nthat the respondent/petitioner has already taken steps to start the\n\nwork and, on 06.11.2021, the respondent/petitioner addressed a\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                          Page 6\n letter to the authorities of PWD bringing the unfortunate situation to\n\nlight.     Further,        contrary       to        the       agreement,          the\n\napplicants/respondents authorities descoped the work of data\n\nnetworking and CCTV cabling at the site and put pressure on the\n\nrespondent/petitioner to complete the work earlier than the\n\nstipulated time period.\n\n[6]            The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner then\n\nsubmitted that in the mean while the newly elected Government\n\nwhich    came         to     power      had      given    pressure         on     the\n\nrespondent/petitioner to complete the project prior in time for\n\ninauguration. Even then, the applicants/respondents authorities did\n\nnot take steps to facilitate such faster rate of work by the\n\nrespondent/petitioner.           On            24.05.2022,           the         third\n\napplicant/respondent granted provisional time extension of the said\n\nwork up 30.09.2022 without prejudice to the right of the\n\nGovernment to recover liquidated damages in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of Clause 5 of the MPWD General Conditions of Contract,\n\n2020 of the agreement dated 08.06.2021. On 04.06.2022, the\n\nrespondent/petitioner         addressed         a    letter     to     the       third\n\napplicant/respondent giving details of various factors which had led\n\nto the delay in project completion, even after making best efforts to\n\ncomplete     the      work    inspite    of     hindrances      faced      by     the\n\nrespondent/petitioner, to the shock and surprise, the third\n\napplicant/respondent sent intimations to the respondent/petitioner\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                                       Page 7\n for slow progress of work and the said letters were suitably replied\n\nby the respondent/petitioner.\n\n[7]           The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner\n\nfurther submitted that the respondent/petitioner had continue to\n\nexecute the work within the extension period and beyond also which\n\nwas within the knowledge of the department and RA bills were also\n\npaid during the said period. In fact, the last RA bill was paid on\n\n06.12.2022. The respondent/petitioner was diligently carrying on\n\nworks at the site and about 95% of the works at the site are\n\ncomplete. Out of the total bill of Rs. 100.78 crore submitted by the\n\nrespondent/petitioner, the department has only paid Rs. 69.11 crore\n\nand there is outstanding of Rs.31.67 crore due. That apart, the\n\nrespondent/petitioner had also sought approval on a large number\n\nof deviation items, which have still not been considered by the\n\ndepartment and remains actionable at the end of Public Works\n\nDepartment.\n\n[8]           The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner\n\nfurther submit that the respondent/petitioner was served show\n\ncause notices in respect of the work and the respondent/petitioner\n\nhas submitted its reply to the show cause notices. The delay in\n\ncompleting the balance work was a subject matter of public interest\n\nlitigation in PIL No. 34 of 2022 and the said PIL was disposed of by\n\nthis Court on 04.04.2023. While so, on 11.04.2023, the third\n\napplicant/respondent issued the impugned order terminating the\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                    Page 8\n agreement      dated    08.06.2021       executed      between       the\n\nrespondent/petitioner and the third applicant/respondent. The\n\nrespondent/petitioner submitted reply dated 13.04.2023 stating that\n\nthe department had not fulfilled its fundamental obligations and had\n\ncommitted fundamental breach of agreement. However, there was\n\nno response from the third applicant/respondent, which necessitated\n\nthe respondent/petitioner in filing the present writ petition. Thus, a\n\nprayer has been made to set aside the impugned termination order\n\nand to allow the respondent/petitioner to continue with the\n\nexecution of the work allotted to the respondent/petitioner, coupled\n\nwith a prayer not to vacate the interim order dated 19.04.2023\n\ngranted by this Court. However, vide order dated 01.08.2023 this\n\nHon&#x27;ble Court vacated the order dated 19.04.2023 by passing the\n\nfollowing order.\n\n             &quot;46. As stated supra, the third respondent decided to\n             conduct a joint measurement of the work done by the\n             petitioner. In the factual scenario put forth by the\n             respective parties, if joint measurement is conducted, no\n             prejudice would be caused to the petitioner and if joint\n             measured is conducted, it will be helpful for the Court to\n             know about the exact work executed at the ground level by\n             the petitioner and based on the report, further steps can be\n             taken in this matter. Moreover, the third respondent has\n             every right to conduct joint measurement to assess the\n             work executed by the contractor at the site. The aforesaid\n             observation of this Court is only in the interest of both\n             parties and for the welfare of the public scheme and the\n             public money involved for construction of Civil Secretariat.\n             Therefore, keeping the writ petition pending, the\n             respondent authorities are directed to conduct joint\n             measurement in order to assess the construction work and\n             the other work done and executed by the petitioner at the\n             site. For the purpose of conducting joint measurement, the\n             interim order dated 19.4.2023 needs to be vacated enabling\n             the respondent authorities to carry out the joint\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                         Page 9\n                 measurement. Therefore, in the interest of justice and\n                without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the\n                respective parties in the main writ petition, this Court is\n                inclined to vacate the interim order dated 19.4.2023\n                passed in the writ petition.\n\n                47. For the reasons stated supra, the interim order dated\n                19.4.203 granted by this Court in the writ petition stands\n                vacated.

The applicant craves the leave of this\n\nHon&#x27;ble Court to rely upon those affidavits, documents/annexures at\n\nthe time of hearing of the present application.\n\n[12]            On 01.08.2023, the Hon&#x27;ble Court was pleased to hear\n\nthe matter [WP(C)No. 358 of 2023] at length and after hearing the\n\nsubmission made by the parties, the Hon&#x27;ble Court was inclined to\n\nvacate the interim order dated 19.04.2023 passed in the writ\n\npetition   in   the    interest   of   justice    thereby    directing    the\n\napplicants/respondents       authorities     to    conduct      the      joint\n\nmeasurement as stated in the impugned order dated 11.04.2023\n\nand file a report before this Hon&#x27;ble Court before the next date of\n\nhearing.\n\n                Further, it is also stated that after delivering the order\n\nby this Hon&#x27;ble Court, learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner\n\nprayed that till the joint measurement is taken place, both the\n\nparties may be directed to maintain the status quo as on that day.\n\nIn view of the prayer made, this Hon&#x27;ble Court, vide another order\n\ndated 01.08.2023, was pleased to order that &quot;till the joint\n\nmeasurement is taken place, both the parties are directed to\n\nmaintain the status quo as on today&quot;.\n\n[13]            In the said order dated 01.08.2023, the Hon&#x27;ble Court\n\nwas pleased to observe as follows:-\n\n\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                             Page 12\n              &quot;.....In the factual scenario put forth by the respective\n             parties, if joint measurement is conducted, no prejudice\n             would be caused to the petitioner and if joint measurement\n             is conducted, it will be helpful for the Court to know about\n             the exact work executed at the ground level by the\n             petitioner and based on the report, further steps can be\n             taken in this matter. Moreover, the third respondent has\n             every right to conduct joint measurement to assess the\n             work executed by the contractor at the site. The aforesaid\n             observation of this Court is only   in the interest of both\n             parties and for the welfare of the public scheme and the\n             public money involved for construction of Civil\n             Secretariat.Therefore, keeping the writ petition pending,\n             the respondent authorities are directed to conduct joint\n             measurement in order to assess the construction work and\n             the other work done and executed by the petitioner at the\n             site. For the purpose of conducting joint measurement, the\n             interim order dated 19.04.2023 needs to be vacated\n             enabling the respondent authorities to carry out of the joint\n             measurement......&quot;\n\n\n[14]         The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents\n\nsubmitted that the Joint Measurement for the work &quot;Construction of\n\nCapital Complex (Civil Secretariat Component) at Mantripukhri&quot; was\n\nconducted as per the direction of this Hon&#x27;ble High Court&#x27;s order\n\ndated 01.08.2023. Thereafter, the Joint Measurement Report, as\n\nfurnished by the Department vide letter dated 27.09.2023, was\n\nsubmitted to this Hon&#x27;ble Court through the Registrar (Judl.) vide\n\nforwarding letter dated 27.09.2023 through the office of the\n\nAdvocate General, Manipur. It is also pertinent to mention herein\n\nthat the petitioner refused to sign in some of the items in list of\n\nitems in the Joint Measurement and the same was indicated\n\nwhile submitting the report before this Hon&#x27;ble Court.\n\n[15]         The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents\n\nalso submitted that on 09.10.2023, the petitioner filed an\n\naffidavit with objection to the Joint Measurement Report dated\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                        Page 13\n 27.09.2023.      In     the     said     objection     affidavit,    the\n\nrespondent/petitioner has clearly mentioned that the representative\n\nof SACIL had refused to sign against some of the items in the list of\n\nitems in the Joint Measurement due to the factual dispute\n\nbetween writ petitioner and the State authorities. On 09.10.2023,\n\nowing to the filing of objection affidavit and seeking time for filing\n\ncounter affidavit in MC(WP(C)) No. 140 of 2023 by the\n\nrespondent/petitioner, the matter could not be heard and adjourned\n\nthereby extending the earlier interim order dated 01.08.2023 till the\n\nnext date.\n\n[16]          The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents\n\nsubmitted that the matter clearly involves disputed question of facts\n\nand admitted by the writ petitioner in the objection affidavit dated\n\n09.10.2023. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in catena of cases had held\n\nthat disputed questions of facts fall outside the writ jurisdiction of\n\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in &quot;Shubhas Jain - versus - Rajeshwari Shivam &amp;\n\nOrs. (2021 SCC Online SC 562)&quot;held as follows:\n\n              &quot;26. It is well settled that the High Court exercising its\n              extraordinary writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the\n              Constitution of India, does not adjudicate hotly disputed\n              question of facts. It is not for the High Court to make a\n              comparative assessment of conflicting technical reports and\n              decide which one is acceptable.&quot;\n\n\n              Therefore, the disputed questions of facts cannot be\n\ndecided by the Writ Court and as such the present writ petition may\n\nbe dismissed in limine by this Hon&#x27;ble Court.\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                       Page 14\n [17]         The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents\n\nalso submitted that the writ petition is also not maintainable as per\n\nthe Arbitration Clause 25 of the Work Agreement (annexed as\n\nAnnexure A/5 in the writ petition) which states as follows:\n\n             &quot;Clause 25 - Settlement of Dispute &amp; Arbitration -\n\n             Except where otherwise provided in the contract, all\n             questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the\n             specifications, design, drawings and instructions here-in-\n             before mentioned and as the quality of workmanship or\n             materials used on the work or as to any other question,\n             claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising\n             out of or relating to the contract, designs, drawings,\n             specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or these\n             conditions or otherwise concerning the works or the\n             execution or failure to execute the same whether arising\n             during the progress of the work or after the cancellation,\n             termination, completion or abandonment thereof shall be\n             dealt with as mentioned hereinafter.\n\n             I.

In\n             view of the factual questions involved in the writ petition\n             and in the absence of detailed counter-affidavit filed by the\n             respondents resisting the allegations set out in the writ\n             petition, the merits of the termination of the agreement\n             dated 08.06.2021 cannot be gone into at this stage.&quot;\n\n\n[19]         The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents\n\nalso submitted that the work &quot;Construction of Capital Project (Civil\n\nSecretariat Component) at Mantripukhri&quot; is a highly prestigious\n\nproject which is of great importance to the State and its people i.e.,\n\npublic utility. The present work has become a prestige issue for the\n\nState Government in front of Central leadership and the Government\n\nof Manipur has decided to complete the work on departmental basis.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention herein that after the completion of the\n\nProject the same is awaited to be inaugurated by the Highest\n\nOfficial of the Central Government as it is actually the project of\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                        Page 18\n National importance. As such, speedy completion of the project is\n\nthe need of the hour in public interest. And the Government may be\n\nallowed to complete the project.\n\n[20]              The learned counsel for the applicants/respondents\n\nsubmitted that the delay in executing the work is not the result of\n\nthe non-payment of bills to the petitioner and, in fact, up-to-date bill\n\namounts have been settled to the petitioner. As far as the pending\n\nbills are concerned, the department checked those bills and found to\n\nbe heavily exceeding than the actual work done and, therefore, the\n\nsame was returned to the petitioner for correction.\n\n\n\n[21]              The learned counsel for the respondent/petitioner has\n\nsubmitted         affidavit-in-opposition     on      behalf        of        the\n\nrespondent/petitioner by denying almost all the submission and the\n\nprayers     put    forth   in   the   miscellaneous   application        by   the\n\napplicant/respondent and submitted that the contents of the\n\nparagraphs are matter of records.\n\n       1.   Submitted that the present application is not maintainable\n            as a writ petition can be maintained in a contractual\n            matter despite existence of an arbitration clause as the lis\n            involves a public law character and the alternative forum\n            chosen by the parties would not be in-a-position to grant\n            appropriate relief. The present action of the state in\n            terminating the present agreement             in question is\n            arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the constitutional\n            rights of the petitioner. Therefore, the present writ\n            petition is maintainable. Hence, this Hon&#x27;ble Court was\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                                Page 19\n          please to pass the interims orders in the present writ\n         petition.\n    2.   Further submitted that the representatives of the\n         respondent-company had refused to sign against the list\n         of items in the Joint measurements dated 27.09.2023 for\n         the following reasons:\n               (i)     The records of the measurements of the\n                       some of the said items were not provided\n                       to the representatives of SACIL by PWD.\n               (ii)    The records of the measurements of the\n                       some of the said items were provided to\n                       the representatives of SACIL by PWD but\n                       without sufficient time to verify and cross-\n                       check the measurements.\n               (iii)   The details of the work done regarding the\n                       said items were not measured by PWD.\n    3.   Further submitted that the present action of the State in\n         terminating the present agreement in question is\n         arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the Constitutional\n         rights of the petitioner and this Hon&#x27;ble Court under writ\n         jurisdiction is competent to decide the present dispute. It\n         is settled law that the need to deal with disputed\n         questions of fact, cannot be made a smokescreen to\n         guillotine a genuine claim raised in a writ petition, when\n         actually the resolution of a disputed question of fact is\n         unnecessary to grant relief to the writ applicant. The\n         case-laws cited by the applicants in the present\n         paragraph are not applicable to the present case.\n    4.   Further submitted that it is settled law that a writ petition\n         can be maintained in a contractual matter despite\n         existence of an arbitration clause in the following\n         alternatives scenarios:\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                     Page 20\n                 (i)       Where    the   lis involves a public law\n                          character      or     requires   a   judicial\n                          determination in rem;\n                (ii)      The alternative forum chosen by the\n                          parties would not be in a position to grant\n                          appropriate relief;\n                (iii)     A statutory contract is in question or the\n                          action of a state or its instrumentality is\n                          demonstrably arbitrary, unreasonable or\n                          violative of the fundamental rights of a\n                          party;\n                (iv)      The matter does not relate only to the\n                          interpretation of a contract which is within\n                          the domain of an arbitrator.\n\n\n                       It is also submitted that the present action of\n\n      the State in terminating the present agreement in question is\n\n      arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the constitutional\n\n      rights of the petitioner and this Hon&#x27;ble Court under writ\n\n      jurisdiction is competent to decide the present dispute. It is\n\n      settled law that the need to deal with disputed questions of\n\n      fact, cannot be made a smokescreen to guillotine a genuine\n\n      claim raised in a writ petition, when actually the resolution of\n\n      a disputed question of fact is unnecessary to grant relief to\n\n      the writ applicant, therefore, the present writ petition is\n\n      maintainable.\n\n    5.       The respondent no. 1 craved leave of this Hon&#x27;ble\n    Court to file an additional affidavit and documents to\n    supplement the present affidavit-in-opposition, if required at\n    a later stage.\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                      Page 21\n [22]        As requested by both the learned counsels, this Court\n\nallowed the request of both the learned counsels to file written\n\nsubmissions in support of their case and the same are reproduced\n\nherein below:\n\n\n[23]        Written submissions submitted on behalf of\n            the State applicants/respondents:\n\n\n            &quot;1.

A bare perusal of the High Court&#x27;s judgment\n                   shows that there was clear non-application of mind.\n                   On one hand the High Court observed that the\n                   disputed questions cannot be gone into a writ\n                   petition. It was also noticed that the essence of the\n                   dispute was breach of contract. After coming to the\n                   above conclusions the High Court should have\n                   dismissed the writ petition. Surprisingly, the High\n                   Court proceeded to examine the case solely on the\n                   writ petitioner&#x27;s assertion and on a very curious\n                   reasoning that though the appellant Corporation\n                   claimed that the value of articles lifted was nearly Rs\n                   14.90 lakhs no details were specifically given. From\n                   the counter-affidavit filed before the High Court it is\n                   crystal-clear that relevant details disputing claim of\n                   the writ petitioner were given. Value of articles lifted\n                   by the writ petitioner is a disputed factual question.\n                   Where a complicated question of fact is involved and\n                   the matter requires thorough proof on factual\n                   aspects, the High Court should not entertain the writ\n                   petition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"460900\" id=\"span_4\">Whether or not the High Court should\n                   exercise jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226</a> of the\n                   Constitution would largely depend upon the\n                   nature of dispute and if the dispute cannot be\n                   resolved without going into the factual\n                   controversy, the High Court should not\n                   entertain the writ petition. As noted above, the\n                   writ petition was primarily founded on allegation of\n                   breach of contract. Question whether the action\n                   of the opposite party in the writ petition\n                   amounted to breach of contractual obligation\n                   ultimately depends on facts and would\n                   require material evidence to be scrutinised\n                   and in such a case writ jurisdiction should not\n                   be exercised.

The respondent then filed a writ petition in the\n                  High Court for refund of the amount. On the\n                  pleadings before it, the High Court raised two\n                  questions viz.: (a) whether the forfeiture of security\n                  deposit is without authority of law and without any\n                  binding contract between the parties and also\n                  contrary to <a href=\"/doc/931937/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 5</a> of the Contract Act; and (b)\n                  whether the writ petition is maintainable in a\n                  claim arising out of a breach of contract.\n                  Question (b) should have been first answered\n                  as it would go to the root of the matter. The\n                  High Court instead considered Question (a) and then\n                  chose not to answer Question (b). In our view, the\n                  answer to Question (b) is clear. It is settled law\n                  that disputes relating to contracts cannot be\n                  agitated under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n                  of India.

This is settled law. The\n                  dispute in this case was regarding the terms of offer.\n                  They were thus contractual disputes in respect\n                  of which a writ court was not the proper\n                  forum.</span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"261761\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956761\" id=\"span_16\">Mr Dave, however, relied upon the cases\n                  of <a href=\"/doc/1956761/\" id=\"a_38\">Verigamto Naveen v.

On a bare reading of the High Court&#x27;s order\n                   and the averments in the writ petitions, one thing is\n                   crystal clear that there was no definite allegation\n                   against any person who was responsible for the so-\n                   called manipulation. It is also not clear as to who\n                   were the parties in the writ petitions filed. In the\n                   grounds indicated in the writ petitions it was stated\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                      Page 37\n                   that there is no bar or impediment on the High\n                  Court reviewing the petitioner&#x27;s case as also\n                  connected cases to enquire into the validity of the\n                  acts done against the writ petitioner. Therefore, it\n                  was an accepted position that the writ petitioners\n                  wanted review of the High Court&#x27;s order, which is\n                  clearly impermissible. No ground for seeking such\n                  review apparently was made out. In any event we\n                  feel that the High Court&#x27;s approach is clearly\n                  erroneous. The present appellants in the\n                  counter-affidavit      filed   had      raised    a\n                  preliminary objection as regards the\n                  maintainability of the writ petitions and had\n                  requested the High Court to grant further\n                  opportunity if the necessity so arises to file a\n                  detailed      counter-affidavit       after     the\n                  preliminary objections were decided. The\n                  High Court in fact in one of the orders clearly\n                  indicated that the preliminary objections were\n                  to be decided first. But strangely it did not do\n                  so. It reserved the judgment and delivered\n                  the final judgment after about three years.\n                  There is also dispute as to whether the\n                  relevant documents were produced. What\n                  baffles us is that in the High Court, records\n                  with original documents were shown to it and\n                  the Bench wanted the copies to be filed. In\n                  the impugned judgment the High Court\n                  proceeded on the basis as if only a few pages\n                  of the files were shown. If that was really the\n                  case, there was no necessity for the High\n                  Court to direct the present appellants to file\n                  copies. If after perusal of the documents the\n                  High Court felt that these were not sufficient\n                  the same would have been stated. But that\n                  does not appear to have been done. The High\n                  Court also had not discussed as to how the\n                  matters which stood concluded could be\n                  reopened in the manner done. No sufficient\n                  grounds have been even indicated as to why\n                  the High Court felt it necessary to do so. To\n                  say that though finality had been achieved,\n                  justice stood at a higher pedestal is not an\n                  answer to the basic question as to whether\n                  the High Court was competent to reopen the\n                  whole issue which had become concluded.\n                  The persons whom the High Court felt were\n                  responsible for alleged manipulation or\n                  persons behind false implication were not\n                  impleaded as parties. Newspaper reports are\n                  not to be considered as evidence. The\n                  authenticity of the newspaper reports was not\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                    Page 38\n                    established by the writ petitioners. Even\n                   otherwise, this could not have been done in a\n                   writ petition, as disputed questions of fact\n                   were apparently involved. The matters which\n                   the High Court found to have been\n                   established were really not so. The\n                   conclusions were based on untested\n                   materials, and the writ petitioners had not\n                   established them by evidence. Since the High\n                   Court has not dealt with the matter in the\n                   proper perspective we feel that it would be\n                   proper for the High Court to rehear the\n                   matter. The High Court shall first decide the\n                   preliminary objections raised by the present\n                   appellants about the non-maintainability of\n                   the writ petitions. Normally such a course is not\n                   to be adopted. But in view of the peculiar facts\n                   involved, it would be the appropriate course to be\n                   adopted in the present case. Therefore, we remit\n                   the matter to the High Court for fresh hearing. We\n                   make it clear that whatever we have observed\n                   should not be treated to be the conclusive findings\n                   on the subject-matter of controversy. The appeals\n                   are allowed without any order as to costs. Since the\n                   matter is pending since long, we request the High\n                   Court to dispose of the matter as early as\n                   practicable, preferably within four months from the\n                   date of receipt of the judgment.

It is respectfully submitted that interim order in\n                         the present matters was passed based on the\n                         settled principles taking into account the three\n                         basic grounds i.e., prima facie case, balance of\n                         convenience       and    irreparable       loss    in    the\n                         particular facts and circumstance of the case.\n                   III. In the instant case, firstly prima facie case\n                         favors the petitioner, given the substantial\n                         completion of a significant portion of the work.\n                         Moreover,     this    Hon&#x27;ble     Court,     through      a\n                         judgment and final order dated 04.04.2023,\n                         disposed of PIL No. 34 of 2022 after hearing\n                         both parties and considering the specific facts\n                         of the case. In this order, the Hon&#x27;ble Court\n                         directed    the      respondent      State        and    the\n                         petitioner herein to complete the work within\n                         a period of 3 (three) months. Despite these\n                         explicit directions, the Department arbitrarily\n                         and   unlawfully        terminated     the        work   on\n                         11.04.2023 within a week. The present writ is\n                         filed to enforce a fundamental right, and\n                         considering the public law character of the\n\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                                   Page 52\n                        dispute, it was admitted as a prima facie case\n                       was established from the outset.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">                  IV. Secondly, the balance of convenience distinctly\n                       favors      the    petitioner,     considering     the\n                       substantial time and financial resources already\n                       invested in executing the work, which is now\n                       approaching completion. The arbitrary and\n                       illegal termination of the Civil Secretariat\n                       Balance work not only poses significant financial\n                       loss to the petitioner but also further delays in\n                       the project&#x27;s completion, leading to additional\n                       losses to the public exchequer. Moreover, it is\n                       emphasized that if the interim order is vacated,\n                       the present matter would become infructuous.\n                       Therefore, the balance of convenience leans in\n                       favor of the Petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_79\">                  V.   Thirdly, petitioner is poised to suffer irreparable\n                       loss due to the arbitrary and illegal termination,\n                       evident in the idleness of its machinery and\n                       materials at the work site. This idle period has\n                       caused further delays in the ongoing works\n                       and, additionally, impacts other projects of the\n                       petitioner. The potential irreparable loss, which\n                       cannot be fully compensated in monetary\n                       terms, necessitated the granting of the interim\n                       order.      Consequently,   this    Hon&#x27;ble      Court,\n                       recognizing the urgency and potential harm to\n                       the petitioner, passed an interim order dated\n                       01.08.2023 in favor of the petitioner. This\n                       interim relief not only addresses the immediate\n                       concerns but also contributes to securing the\n                       final relief sought by the petitioner in the writ\n                       petition.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                            Page 53\n                   VI. Therefore, the three cardinal principles i.e.,\n                      prima facie case; balance of convenience; and\n                      irreparable injury, which are required to be\n                      considered in a proper perspective in the facts\n                      and circumstances of a particular case for\n                      granting the interim relief, lies in the favor of\n                      the Petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"36995966\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1722738\" id=\"span_27\">VII.

Therefore,\n                      the object of granting interim relief is, to\n                      protect   the     petitioner   against   injury   by\n                      violation of his right for which he could not be\n                      adequately        compensated       in    damages\n                      recoverable in the action.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_82\">                  VIII.

Additionally, failure to grant the\n                      status quo by this Hon&#x27;ble Court would allow\n                      the Respondent department to establish third-\n                      party rights, leading to substantial delays in\n                      the completion of the said project.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">                  IX.

So far as the view taken by the High Court that the\n              remedy by way of recourse to arbitration clause was\n              available to the appellants and therefore the writ petition\n              filed by the appellants was liable to be dismissed is\n              concerned, suffice it to observe that the rule of exclusion of\n              writ jurisdiction by availability of an alternative remedy is a\n              rule of discretion and not one of compulsion. In an\n              appropriate case, in spite of availability of the alternative\n              remedy, the High Court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction\n              in at least three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                                  Page 56\n             seeks enforcement of any of the fundamental rights; (ii)\n            where there is failure of principles of natural justice; or (iii)\n            where the orders or proceedings are wholly without\n            jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged. (See\n            <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_70\">Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks</a>.) The present\n            case attracts applicability of the first two contingencies.\n            Moreover, as noted, the petitioners&#x27; dealership, which is\n            their bread and butter, came to be terminated for an\n            irrelevant and non-existent cause. In such circumstances,\n            we feel that the appellants should have been allowed relief\n            by the High Court itself instead of driving them to the need\n            of initiating arbitration proceedings.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"609434\" id=\"span_33\"> (2011) 5 SCC 697 - (<a href=\"/doc/609434/\" id=\"a_71\">Union of India &amp; Ors.

Apart from the above, even on the question of\n            maintainability of the writ petition on account of the\n            arbitration clause included in the agreement between the\n            parties, it is now well established that an alternative remedy\n            is not an absolute bar to the invocation of the writ\n            jurisdiction of the High Court or the Supreme Court and\n            that without exhausting such alternative remedy, a writ\n            petition would not be maintainable. The various decisions\n            cited by Mr. Chakraborty would clearly indicate that the\n            constitutional powers vested in the High Court or the\n            Supreme Court cannot be fettered by any alternative\n            remedy available to the authorities. Injustice, whenever and\n            wherever it takes place, has to be struck down as an\n            anathema to the rule of law and the provisions of the\n            Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_91\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127571616\" id=\"span_34\"> (<a href=\"/doc/127571616/\" id=\"a_72\">2021) 6 SCC 15 - U.P.

Even though there is an arbitration clause, the\n            petitioner herein has not opposed the writ petition on the\n            ground of existence of an arbitration clause.

Much of the ground which was sought to be canvassed\n            in the course of the pleadings is now subsumed in the\n            submissions which have been urged before this Court on\n            behalf of the State of Telangana and TSIIC. As we have\n            noted earlier, during the course of the hearing, the learned\n            Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of\n            Telangana and ISIIC informed the Court that the\n            entitlement of Unitech to seek a refund is not questioned\n            nor is the availability of the land for carrying out the project\n            being placed in issue. The learned Senior Counsel also did\n            not agitate the ground that a remedy for the recovery of\n            moneys arising out a contractual matter cannot be availed\n            of under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. However, to clear\n            the ground, it is necessary to postulate that recourse to the\n            jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is not\n            excluded altogether in a contractual matter.

However, the presence of an\n            arbitration clause within a contract between a State\n            instrumentality and a private party has not acted as an\n            absolute bar to availing remedies under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 226</a><a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_85\">,\n\n            39.4.</a> If the State instrumentality violates its constitutional\n            mandate under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 14</a> to act fairly and reasonably, relief\n            under the plenary powers of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n            would lie.

The\n                   High Court having regard to the facts of the case,\n                   has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a\n                   writ petition. The Court has imposed upon itself\n                   certain restrictions in the exercise of this power.\n                   (See <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_91\">Whirlpool Corpn. v.

Therefore, while exercising its jurisdiction under\n            <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 226</a>, the Court is entitled to enquire into whether the\n            action of the State or its instrumentalities is arbitrary or\n            unfair and in consequence, in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 14.</a> The\n            jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 226</a> is a valuable constitutional\n            safeguard against an arbitrary exercise of State power or a\n            misuse of authority.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                         Page 59\n             39.6. In determining as to whether the jurisdiction should\n            be exercised in a contractual dispute, the Court must,\n            undoubtedly eschew, disputed questions of fact which\n            would depend upon an evidentiary determination requiring\n            a trial. But equally, it is well settled that the jurisdiction\n            under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 226</a> cannot be ousted only on the basis that\n            the dispute pertains to the contractual arena. This is for the\n            simple reason that the State and its instrumentalities are\n            not exempt from the duty to act fairly merely because in\n            their business dealings they have entered into the realm of\n            contract. Similarly, the presence of an arbitration clause\n            does (sic not) oust the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 226</a> in all\n            cases though, it still needs to be decided from case to case\n            as to whether recourse to a public law remedy can\n            justifiably be invoked.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">            39.7. The jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 226</a> was rightly invoked\n            by the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the Andhra\n            Pradesh High Court in this case, when the foundational\n            representation of the contract has failed. TSIIC, a State\n            instrumentality, has not just reneged on its contractual\n            obligation, but hoarded the refund of the principal and\n            interest on the consideration that was paid by Unitech over\n            a decade ago. It does not dispute the entitlement of\n            Unitech to the refund of its principal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">            40. In the present case, the basic postulate underlying the\n            contract between the parties was the availability of the land\n            which comprised the project site. The LoA dated 28-11-\n            2007 stated that the allotment of land was subject to the\n            outcome of the pending appeal before the High Court of\n            Andhra Pradesh. The dispute over the title of the\n            Government of Andhra Pradesh was the subject of the\n            pending litigation. At the same time, the LoA mandated that\n            Unitech must pay the amount stipulated including the\n            purchase price of Rs. 145 crores for the land as well as the\n            project development expenses. A failure to do so would\n            constitute a significant event of default resulting in a\n            forfeiture of the earnest money deposit. Acting on the LoA,\n            Unitech did in fact comply with its obligation to pay, having\n            paid a total amount of Rs. 165 crores towards the purchase\n            price, besides the earnest money deposit and project\n            development expenses. The development agreement which\n            was executed between APIIC and Unitech contains specific\n            representations to the effect that APIIC was authorised to\n            transfer and deliver the project site admeasuring 350 acres\n            on an outright sale basis. Under the development\n            agreement, APIIC was to sell and transfer the land\n            absolutely together with its right, title and interest, free\n            from all encumbrances by executing a sale agreement. The\n            terms of the agreement were to prevail in the event of any\n            conflict with any other document which formed a part of the\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                        Page 60\n             bidding process. The terms of the agreement were placed\n            on the pedestal of the highest priority for interpretation, as\n            compared to other documents, including the LoA. Under the\n            terms of the development agreement, APIIC was obligated\n            to sell and transfer the land together with its right, title and\n            interest free from all encumbrances &quot;forthwith upon\n            payment of the last instalment of the total purchase price\n            by the developer&quot;. That Unitech paid the total purchase\n            price is not in dispute. The obligation assumed by APIIC to\n            hand over possession together with title upon the payment\n            of the last instalment of the purchase price unequivocally\n            emerges from <a href=\"/doc/452639/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 3.1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/989492/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 4.1</a> of the development\n            agreement.

We may cull out our conclusions in regard to the\n            points, which we have framed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">            82.1. It is, undoubtedly, true that the writ jurisdiction is a\n            public law remedy. A matter, which lies entirely within a\n            private realm of affairs of public body, may not lend itself\n            for being dealt with under the writ jurisdiction of the Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125036411\" id=\"span_42\">82.2. The principle <a href=\"/doc/125036411/\" id=\"a_102\">laid down in</a> Bareilly Development\n            Authority that in the case of a non-statutory contract the\n            rights are governed only by the terms of the contract and\n            the decisions, which are purported to be followed, including\n            Radhakrishna Agarwal, may not continue to hold good, in\n            the light of what has been <a href=\"/doc/125036411/\" id=\"a_103\">laid down in</a> ABL and as followed\n            in the recent judgment in Sudhir Kumar Singh.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">            82.3. The mere fact that relief is sought under a contract\n            which is not statutory, will not entitle the respondent State\n            in a case by itself to ward off scrutiny of its action or\n            inaction under the contract, if the complaining party is able\n            to establish that the action/inaction is, per se, arbitrary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"884513\" id=\"span_43\">82.4. An action will lie, undoubtedly, when the State\n            purports to award any largesse and, undoubtedly, this\n            relates to the stage prior to the contract being entered into\n            (see Ramana Dayaram Shetty). This scrutiny, no doubt,\n            would be undertaken within the nature of the judicial\n            review, which has been declared in the decision in <a href=\"/doc/884513/\" id=\"a_104\">Tata\n            Cellular v. Union of India</a>.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">MC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                          Page 61\n             82.5. After the contract is entered into, there can be a\n            variety of circumstances, which may provide a cause of\n            action to a party to the contract with the State, to seek\n            relief by filing a writ petition.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">            82.6. Without intending to be exhaustive, it may include the\n            relief of seeking payment of amounts due to the aggrieved\n            party from the State. The State can, indeed, be called upon\n            to honour its obligations of making payment, unless it be\n            that there is a serious and genuine dispute raised relating to\n            the liability of the State to make the payment. Such dispute,\n            ordinarily, would include the contention that the aggrieved\n            party has not fulfilled its obligations and the Court finds that\n            such a contention by the State is not a mere ruse or a\n            pretence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">            82.7. The existence of an alternate remedy, is,\n            undoubtedly, a matter to be borne in mind in declining relief\n            in a writ petition in a contractual matter. Again, the\n            question as to whether the writ petitioner must be told off\n            the gates, would depend upon the nature of the claim and\n            relief sought by the petitioner, the questions, which would\n            have to be decided, and, most importantly, whether there\n            are disputed questions of fact, resolution of which is\n            necessary, as an indispensable prelude to the grant of the\n            relief sought. Undoubtedly, while there is no prohibition, in\n            the writ court even deciding disputed questions of fact,\n            particularly when the dispute surrounds demystifying of\n            documents only, the Court may relegate the party to the\n            remedy by way of a civil suit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_44\">82.8. The existence of a provision for arbitration, which is a\n            forum intended to quicken the pace of dispute resolution, is\n            viewed as a near bar to the entertainment of a writ petition\n            [see in this regard, the view of this Court even in ABL1Q\n            explaining how it distinguished the decision of this Court in\n            <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_105\">State of U.P. v. Bridge &amp; Roof Co. (India) Ltd.</a>, by its\n            observations in SCC para 14 in ABL].</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">            82.9. The need to deal with disputed questions of fact,\n            cannot be made a smokescreen to guillotine a genuine\n            claim raised in a writ petition, when actually the resolution\n            of a disputed question of fact is unnecessary to grant relief\n            to a writ applicant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">            82.10. The reach of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 14</a> enables a writ court to deal\n            with arbitrary State action even after a contract is entered\n            into by the State. A wide variety of circumstances can\n            generate causes of action for invoking <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 14.</a> The\n            Court&#x27;s approach in dealing with the same, would be guided\n            by, undoubtedly, the overwhelming need to obviate\n            arbitrary State action, in cases where the writ remedy\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                          Page 62\n             provides an effective and fair means of preventing\n            miscarriage of justice arising from palpably unreasonable\n            action by the State.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">            82.11. Termination of contract can again arise in a wide\n            variety of situations. If for instance, a contract is\n            terminated, by a person, who is demonstrated, without any\n            need for any argument, to be the person, who is completely\n            unauthorised to cancel the contract, there may not be any\n            necessity to drive the party to the unnecessary ordeal of a\n            prolix and avoidable round of litigation. The intervention by\n            the High Court, in such a case, where there is no dispute to\n            be resolved, would also be conducive in public interest,\n            apart from ensuring the fundamental right of the petitioner\n            under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. When it comes\n            to a challenge to the termination of a contract by the State,\n            which is a non-statutory body, which is acting in purported\n            exercise of the powers/rights under such a contract, it\n            would be over simplifying a complex issue to lay down any\n            inflexible rule in favour of the Court turning away the\n            petitioner to alternate fora. Ordinarily, the cases of\n            termination of contract by the State, acting within its\n            contractual domain, may not lend itself for appropriate\n            redress by the writ court. This is, undoubtedly, so if the\n            Court is duty- bound to arrive at findings, which involve\n            untying knots, which are presented by disputed questions of\n            facts. Undoubtedly, in view of ABL, if resolving the dispute,\n            in a case of repudiation of a contract, involves only\n            appreciating the true scope of documentary material in the\n            light of pleadings, the Court may still grant relief to an\n            applicant. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_45\">We must enter a caveat. The Courts are today\n            reeling under the weight of a docket explosion, which is\n            truly alarming. If a case involves a large body of documents\n            and the Court is called upon to enter upon findings of facts\n            and involves merely the construction of the document, it\n            may not be an unsound discretion to relegate the party to\n            the alternate remedy. This is not to deprive the Court of its\n            constitutional power as <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_109\">laid down in</a> ABL. It all depends\n            upon the facts of each case as to whether, having regard to\n            the scope of the dispute to be resolved, whether the Court\n            will still entertain the petition.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_46\">82.12. In a case the State is a party to the contract and a\n            breach of a contract is alleged against the State, a civil\n            action in the appropriate forum is, undoubtedly,\n            maintainable. But this is not the end of the matter. Having\n            regard to the position of the State and its duty to act fairly\n            and to eschew arbitrariness in all its actions, resort to the\n            constitutional remedy on the cause of action, that the action\n            is arbitrary, is permissible (see in this regard <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_110\">Shrilekha\n            Vidyarthi v. State of U.P.</a>). However, it must be made clear\n            that every case involving breach of contract by the State,\n\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                        Page 63\n             cannot be dressed up and disguised as a case of arbitrary\n            State action. While the concept of an arbitrary action or\n            inaction cannot be cribbed or confined to any immutable\n            mantra, and must be laid bare, with reference to the facts\n            of each case, it cannot be a mere allegation of breach of\n            contract that would suffice. What must be involved in the\n            case must be action/inaction, which must be palpably\n            unreasonable or absolutely irrational and bereft of any\n            principle. An action, which is completely mala fide, can\n            hardly be described as a fair action and may, depending on\n            the facts, amount to arbitrary action. The question must be\n            posed and answered by the Court and all we intend to lay\n            down is that there is a discretion available to the Court to\n            grant relief in appropriate cases.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">            82.13. A lodestar, which may illumine the path of the Court,\n            would be the dimension of public interest subserved by the\n            Court interfering in the matter, rather than relegating the\n            matter to the alternate forum.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">            82.14. Another relevant criteria is, if the Court has\n            entertained the matter, then, while it is not tabooed that\n            the Court should not relegate the party at a later stage,\n            ordinarily, it would be a germane consideration, which may\n            persuade the Court to complete what it had started,\n            provided it is otherwise a sound exercise of jurisdiction to\n            decide the matter on merits in the writ petition itself.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">            82.15.

Relying on Mohinder Singh Gill, the appellants\n            were not permitted to supplement the reasons for\n            termination.

As per Section 5-B, a candidate belonging to reserved\n         category, who has made an application to the Scrutiny\n         Committee for issuance of validity certificate prior to date of\n         filing of nomination is obliged to submit the certificate within six\n         months from the date of election (now substituted by twelve\n         months), failing which his election shall be deemed to have\n         been terminated retrospectively. The second proviso to Section\n         5-B creates a deeming fiction, which operates when a person\n         failed to produce the validity certificate within a period of six\n         months/twelve months from the date of his election. The\n         present is a case where before expiry of period of six months\n         from the date of election i.e. 23-2-2017, the Caste Scrutiny\n         Committee has rejected the claim of the respondent and a writ\n         petition was filed by the respondent before expiry of period of\n         six months and the High Court also granted an interim order on\n         18-8- 2017 i.e. within a period of six months, after expiry of\n         which the deeming fiction was to come into existence.

The\n         jurisdiction of the High Court to pass the above interim order\n         dated 18-8-2017 is questioned by the appellants. Caste\n         Scrutiny Committee, which is a statutory authority constituted\n         under the State enactment to verify the caste claimed by\n         citizens, in event, illegally rejects the claim of citizen, does the\n         citizen have no right to seek judicial remedy? Can the illegal\n         rejection of caste claim of a citizen is a fait accompli after\n         expiry of period of six months?

They have, therefore,\n                referred the matter directly to a Bench of five Judges.\n                In our view, judicial discipline and propriety demands\n                that a Bench of two learned Judges should follow a\n                decision of a Bench of three learned Judges.

The Division Bench of this Court directed the\n              State and the petitioner to comply with their\n              contractual obligations qua the completion of the\n              construction of Civil Secretariat Work. According to\n              the respondents, the petitioner has violated the\nMC(WP(C)) No. 357 of 2023                                         Page 71\n             terms and conditions of the agreement and\n            therefore the third respondent has rightly\n            terminated the agreement dated 08.06.2021.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">            45. As could also be seen from the general conditions of the\n            contract, particularly Clause 25 provides settlement of\n            dispute and arbitration of the conditions of the contract\n            agreement to settle any dispute or grievances, if any. In\n            view of the factual questions involved in the writ petition\n            and in the absence of detailed counter-affidavit filed by the\n            respondents resisting the allegations set out in the writ\n            petition, the merits of the termination of the agreement\n            dated 08.06.2021 cannot be gone into at this stage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">            46. As stated supra, the third respondent decided to\n            conduct a joint measurement of the work done by the\n            petitioner. In the factual scenario put forth by the\n            respective parties, if joint measurement is conducted, no\n            prejudice would be caused to the petitioner and if joint\n            measured is conducted, it will be helpful for the Court to\n            know about the exact work executed at the ground level by\n            the petitioner and based on the report, further steps can be\n            taken in this matter. Moreover, the third respondent has\n            every right to conduct joint measurement to assess the\n            work executed by the contractor at the site. The aforesaid\n            observation of this Court is only in the interest of both\n            parties and for the welfare of the public scheme and the\n            public money involved for construction of Civil Secretariat.\n            Therefore, keeping the writ petition pending, the\n            respondent authorities are directed to conduct joint\n            measurement in order to assess the construction work and\n            the other work done and executed by the petitioner at the\n            site. For the purpose of conducting joint measurement, the\n            interim order dated 19.4.2023 needs to be vacated enabling\n            the respondent authorities to carry out the joint\n            measurement. Therefore, in the interest of justice and\n            without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the\n            respective parties in the main writ petition, this Court is\n            inclined to vacate the interim order dated 19.4.2023\n            passed in the writ petition.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">            47. For the reasons stated supra, the interim order dated\n            19.4.203 granted by this Court in the writ petition stands\n            vacated. The respondent authorities are directed to conduct\n            the joint measurement as stated in the impugned order\n            dated 11.04.2023 and file a report before this Court before\n            the date of hearing on 04.09.2023.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">            48.

Any public work must progress\n            without interruption.

The role of courts in this exercise is\n            to interfere to the minimum extent so that public works\n            projects will not be impeded or stalled.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">            21.     Since the construction of road is an infrastructure\n            project and keeping in view the intent of the legislature that\n            infrastructure projects should not be stayed, the High Court\n            would have been well advised to hold its hand to stay the\n            construction of the infrastructure project. Such provision\n            should be kept in view even by the writ court while\n            exercising its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 226</a> of the\n            Constitution of India.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\">[33]        The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in (2021)20 SCC 454 at\nPara No. 25 observed that\n            &quot;25. It is well settled that the High Court exercising its\n            extraordinary writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 226</a> of the\n            Constitution of India, does not adjudicate hotly disputed\n            questions of facts.

A bare perusal of the High Court&#x27;s judgment shows\n             that there was clear non-application of mind. On one hand\n             the High Court observed that the disputed questions cannot\n             be gone into a writ petition. It was also noticed that the\n             essence of the dispute was breach of contract. After coming\n             to the above conclusions the High Court should have\n             dismissed the writ petition. Surprisingly, the High Court\n             proceeded to examine the case solely on the writ\n             petitioner&#x27;s assertion and on a very curious reasoning that\n             though the appellant Corporation claimed that the value of\n             articles lifted was nearly R. 14.90 lakhs no details were\n             specifically given. From the counter-affidavit filed before the\n             High Court it is crystal-clear that relevant details disputing\n             claim of the writ petitioner were given. Value of articles\n             lifted by the writ petitioner is a disputed factual question.\n             Where a complicated question of fact is involved and the\n             matter requires thorough proof on factual aspects, the High\n             Court should not entertain the writ petition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"460900\" id=\"span_66\">Whether or not\n             the High Court should exercise jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 226</a>\n             of the Constitution would largely depend upon the nature of\n             dispute and if the dispute cannot be resolved without going\n             into the factual controversy, the High Court should not\n             entertain the writ petition. As noted above, the writ petition\n             was primarily founded on allegation of breach of contract.\n             Question whether the action of the opposite party in the\n             writ petition amounted to breach of contractual obligation\n             ultimately depends on facts and would require material\n             evidence to be scrutinized and in such a case writ\n             jurisdiction should not be exercised.

Therefore, the dispute could not be raised by way of\n             a writ petition on the disputed questions of fact. Though,\n             the jurisdiction of the High Court is wide but in respect of\n             pure contractual matters in the field of private law, having\n             no statutory flavor, are better adjudicated upon by the\n             forum agreed to by the parties. The dispute as to whether\n             the amount is payable or not and / or how much amount is\n             payable are disputed questions of facts. There is no\n             admission on the part of the appellants to infer that the\n             amount stands crystallized.
