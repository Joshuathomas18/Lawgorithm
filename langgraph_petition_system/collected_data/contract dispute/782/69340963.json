If those facts are disputed and\nrequire assessment of evidence the correctness\nof which can only be tested satisfactorily by\ntaking detailed evidence, involving examination\nand cross- examination of witnesses, the case\ncould not be conveniently or satisfactorily\ndecided in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution.

Writ petition was not maintainable to\navoid contractual obligation. Occurrence of\ncommercial difficulty, inconvenience or hardship\nin performance of the conditions agreed to in\nthe contract can provide no justification in not\ncomplying with the terms of contract which the\nparties had accepted with open eyes. It cannot\never be that a licensee can work out the license\nif he finds it profitable to do so: and he can\nchallenge the conditions under which he agreed\nto take the license, if he finds it commercially\ninexpedient to conduct his business.\n70.6. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is\ncomplained of, the party complaining of such\nbreach may sue for specific performance of the\ncontract, if contract is capable of being\nspecifically performed.

However, it has not been totally\nobliterated and where the matter falls purely in\nprivate field of contract, this Court has\nmaintained the position that writ petition is not\nmaintainable. The dichotomy between public\nlaw and private law, rights and remedies would\ndepend on the factual matrix of each case and\nthe distinction between public law remedies and\nprivate law field, cannot be demarcated with\nprecision. In fact, each case has to be\nexamined, on its facts whether the contractual\nrelations between the parties bear insignia of\npublic element. Once on the facts of a particular\ncase it is found that nature of the activity or\ncontroversy involves public law element, then\nthe matter can be examined by the High Court\nin writ petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India to see whether action of\nthe State and/or instrumentality or agency of\nthe State is fair, just and equitable or that\nrelevant factors are taken into consideration\nand irrelevant factors have not gone into the\ndecision-making process or that the decision is\nnot arbitrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">70.10.

Although the dispute arises from a\n       commercial contract, we find that the writ\n       petition     challenging    the    clauses    was\n       maintainable. It is not disputed that GAIL is a\n       Public Sector Undertaking and thus qualifies\n       under the definition of &#x27;State&#x27; as per <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 12</a>\n       of the Constitution. At the time of entering into\n       contract, GAIL was enjoying a monopolistic\n       position with respect to the supply of natural\n       gas in the country. <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">IPC</a>L, having incurred a\n       significant expense in setting up the appropriate\n       infrastructure, had no choice but to enter into\n       agreement with GAIL. Thus, there was a clear\n       public element involved in the dealings between\n       the parties. Further, writ jurisdiction can be\n       exercised when the State, even in its\n       contractual dealings, fails to exercise a degree\n       of fairness or practices any discrimination. We\n       are fortified in our view by this Court&#x27;s decision\n       in <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_18\">ABL Enterprises Ltd., v. Export Credit\n       Guarantee Corpn. of India Ltd.</a>, (2004) 3 SCC\n       553 and Joshi Technologies International Inc. v.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">       Union of India, (2015) 7 SCC 728. .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">                          - 16 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">                                            NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                       WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">       22.       In the present case, GAIL&#x27;s action in\n       levying &#x27;loss of transportation charges&#x27; was ex\n       facie discriminatory, insofar as <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a>L was\n       mandated to build its own pipeline in terms of\n       the allocation letter and was not using GAIL&#x27;s\n       HBJ pipeline at all. Thus, it cannot be said that\n       merely because an alternative remedy was\n       available, the Court should opt out of exercising\n       jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n       and relegate the parties to a civil remedy.\n       ***\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">       29.     We thus dismiss the appeal(s) qua the\n       aspect of maintainability of the writ petition and\n       the quashing of the clauses dealing with loss of\n       transportation charges in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">IPC</a>L.\n       However, we deem it fit to restrict the relief to\n       period of three years insofar as refund is\n       concerned from the date of filing of the writ\n       petition, i.e., 09.03.2006.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n4.15.

Moreso,     when   same   is\n\n     discriminatory or if the authority fails to act\n\n     with    a    degree     of    fairness    and   in   such\n\n     circumstance the existence of the alternative\n\n     remedy will not be a ground to dismiss the writ\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">                       - 17 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\">                                   NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                 WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n     petition or relegate the petitioner to such\n\n     alternative forum.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">\n4.16.

The aspect of jurisdiction to be exercised by this\n\n          Court in respect of contractual matters has\n\n          been succinctly dealt with by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n          Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_29\">Joshi Technologies</a> case\n\n          supra, more particularly at para 69 and 70,\n\n          which have been extracted hereinabove.\n\n\n     9.2.

In the present case, the main contention which\n\n     has been raised is that there is an arbitration\n\n     clause in the agreement and further before\n\n     initiating    the      arbitration,      the   amicable\n\n     resolution process has not been followed, there\n\n     is infact no particular dispute raised as regards\n\n     the liability of making payment or not.\n\n\n9.4. Merely stating there is an arbitral clause would\n\n     not come to the rescue of the BBMP, inasmuch\n\n     as,   the    Hon&#x27;ble     Supreme       Court   in    <a href=\"/doc/127571616/\" id=\"a_30\">Ravi\n\n     Constructions,          Uttar     Pradesh           Power\n\n     Transmission</a> case supra has categorically</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">                       - 23 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">                                    NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                   WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n     come to a conclusion that mere existence of an\n\n     arbitration clause would not come in the way of\n\n     this Court exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article\n\n     226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_32\">227</a> of the Constitution of India, when\n\n     there is a manifest error or arbitrary exercise of\n\n     power which is pointed out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">\n9.5. The State and its constituents enter into various\n\n     contractual relations under which there are\n\n     obligations which are required to be discharged\n\n     by both the parties.      Like the State being a\n\n     model employer in respect of its employees and\n\n     workman, the State is also required to be a\n\n     model employee in respect of the contractors.\n\n     The contractors bid for tenders and take up\n\n     work on the basis that the payment would be\n\n     made in time and that the State has all the\n\n     necessary funds for doing so and as such their\n\n     interest is secured.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">                       - 24 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">                                      NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                    WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n9.6. More often than not a contractor would avail\n\n     loans and/or financial facilities from Banks and\n\n     financial institutions to generate the working\n\n     capital required for such works, which is what\n\n     the petitioner has done in the present matter.\n\n     It is therefore required that the State and its\n\n     instrumentality as aforesaid act as such model\n\n     employer in respect of contracts also and the\n\n     bills which are submitted by the contractors are\n\n     processed at the earliest without any delay in\n\n     terms of the contract and whatever payments\n\n     are due are so made at the earliest.             Of\n\n     course, there may be a dispute as regards the\n\n     determination, assessment and payment which\n\n     are factual in nature which would require those\n\n     disputes to be agitated before the concerned\n\n     Courts or Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">\n9.7. However, insofar as the undisputed amounts\n\n     are   concerned,      they     could   always   be\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">                         - 25 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_74\">                                       NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                     WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n     determined and paid subject however to there\n\n     been no counter claim on behalf of the State or\n\n     its authorities.

Thus,    whether       a    contract   provides   an\n\n     arbitrational clause or not, whether the matter\n\n     could be agitated before the Civil Court or not.\n\n     In so far as the admitted amounts concerned or\n\n     in so far as the determination due amounts are\n\n     concerned this Court could always direct the\n\n     State or its authorities to so determine the\n\n     amounts due and only in relation to the\n\n     disputed amounts, facts or issues relegate the\n\n     petitioner to the alternative remedy of an\n\n     arbitration or a Civil Suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">\n9.9.

Answer to point No.2:- Whether in the present\n      case, the petitioner has made grounds for this\n      Court to exercise the jurisdiction?\n\n      10.1. The main contention of the respondent BBMP is\n\n           that there is an arbitral clause and before\n\n           invocation of the arbitral clause, the process of\n\n           amicable settlement would have to be resorted\n\n           to.

Ramesh.,\n\n           learned counsel appearing for respondents No.1\n\n           and 2 is that if the petitioner had approached\n\n           the    Chief   Commissioner        for    an    amicable\n\n           resolution, the same could have been worked\n\n           out.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">                           - 27 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">                                              NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                           WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n10.2.

As pointed out by Smt.Jayna Kothari., learned\n\n     senior counsel payments have been made from\n\n     the year 2017-2019 and from the year 2021\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">                        - 30 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_91\">                                    NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                  WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n     onwards. It is only for the year 2020 that the\n\n     payment has not been made insofar as the\n\n     maintenance activities are concerned.\n\n\n10.7. The fact that the payments have been made\n\n     until 2019 and from year 2021 onwards would\n\n     also give raise to an inference that the due\n\n     amounts of the year 2020 ought to have been\n\n     paid. Without making payments of bills for the\n\n     year 2020, the respondents have prevailed\n\n     upon the petitioner to continue its services\n\n     which has been rendered for the year 2021\n\n     onwards.

The State and its instrumentality are admittedly\n\n      parties to the highest number of litigations\n\n      before the Courts.

Need for Alternative Dispute Resolution\n\n        1.1. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) refers to a\n        range of dispute resolution procedures, that are\n        mainly perceived as alternatives to litigation. ADR\n        mechanisms are grouped as such, typically because\n        they are non-judicial and out-of-court methods of\n        resolving disputes. However, a deeper analysis would\n        reveal that ADR is a mere overarching term for a wide\n        variety of mechanisms. The term includes voluntary\n        settlement-based mechanisms such as negotiation,\n        mediation, conciliation etc.; private adjudicatory\n        mechanisms such as arbitration; hybrid and flexible\n        mechanisms such as ombudspersons, grievance\n        redressal officers, med-arb, online dispute resolution\n        etc. Therefore, ADR does not refer to a single uniform\n        mechanism, but a range of dispute resolution options\n        available to disputing parties, outside court.\n\n        1.2. Dispute Prevention and Dispute Resolution are the\n        chief objectives of any ADR. While parties resort to\n        litigation upon a conflict being escalated to a full-\n        fledged dispute, ADR options can be designed to\n        prevent dispute escalation and further resolve any\n        disputes through voluntary settlement or private\n        adjudicatory mechanisms. Therefore, this Policy\n        encourages the adoption and use of ADR to prevent\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">                       - 35 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">                                     NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                   WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nand resolve government disputes, mainly through\nfollowing main recommendations:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">1.2.1. This Policy recommends establishment of a\nDispute Resolution Board in each Department. Most\nindividual officers hesitate from ADR settlement\nprocesses, as they apprehend false allegations of\nunderhanded      settlements.   It    is   therefore\nrecommended that any settlement be authorized by\nand be subject to approval of the Dispute Resolution\nBoard at the Department level.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">1.2.2. There shall be an Inter-Departmental Alternative\nDispute Resolution Working Group, led by the Office of\nthe Advocate General. The Working Group shall assist\neach Department in evolving an ADR Strategy and\nidentifying disputes/dispute areas suitable for ADR.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">1.2.3. In order to resolve inter-departmental disputes,\ni.e., disputes arising between two or more State\nDepartments, there shall be an Inter-Departmental\nDispute Redressal Committee, headed by the Chief\nSecretary or Additional Chief Secretary. The Committee\nshall use suitable ADR mechanisms to address the\nconflict and resolve disputes, as far as practicable\nwithout resort to litigation. The Committee shall also\nrecommend suitable ways of resolving disputes without\nresort to litigation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">1.2.4. In determining suitability of disputes to ADR\nprocesses, suitability standards as laid out by the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court must be adopted to guide\nidentifications of disputes/dispute areas for ADR.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">2.

It\n                 is a fast-developing\n                 mechanism,     offering\n                 potential to resolve\n                 disputes faster and at\n                 scale.\n\n\n\n3. Benefits of ADR\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">3.1.ADR mechanisms generally offer broad ranging\nprocedural and outcome benefits to stakeholders.\nWhile benefits are mostly dependent on the specific\nADR mechanism, it is useful to consider how ADR in\ngeneral, positively contributes to the dispute\nresolution process:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"> 3.1.1. ADR mechanisms provide systemic relief to\ncourts by diverting cases away from litigation\ntowards alterative processes. Since the government\nis the biggest litigator, resolution of government\ndisputes through ADR will also contribute to relieving\nthe burden of the legal system.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">3.1.2. The flexibility of ADR processes fosters speedy\nresolutions and speedy justice, contributing to\nefficient dispute management and disposal. When\nemployed effectively, ADR also lowers costs of\ndisputes, particularly when compared to time and\ncosts involved in waging protracted legal battles.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">3.1.3. ADR processes and designs assist dispute\nprevention    objectives.   Mediation,    conciliation,\ngrievance redressal and consultation processes are\ninstrumental in early stage conflict management,\nthereby preventing escalation of disputes. Further,\narbitral awards and mutually agreed settlements\nattain a great degree of finality under law, with very\nnarrow scope for further disputes by appeals etc.\n\n3.1.4. ADR processes can be more suited and\nresponsive (than litigation) for the requirements of\ncertain disputes and parties. Negotiation and\nmediation processes allow interest-based settlement.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">                     - 42 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">                                   NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                 WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nArbitration allows ease in trial and evidentiary\nprocess and offers a better forum for complex\ndisputes and disputes requiring subject-matter\nexpertise. ADR designs also allow collaborative\ndecision-making and resolution. Therefore, ADR is\nmore suited for parties for whom quick negotiated\nagreements offer better solutions than litigation; for\nparties interested in maintaining working or business\nrelationships, while resolving conflict (example,\nservice and workplace dispute); and for parties who\nbenefit from collaborative decision-making to resolve\nconflict than from an adversarial process.\n\n3.1.5. ADR can increase party satisfaction with\nprocess and outcome. While litigation functions in a\nstandard and rigid environment, ADR mechanisms\ncan be more flexible to incorporate and address the\ninterests of the party, thereby increasing their\nsatisfaction in the process and outcome.\n\n3.1.6. ADR processes allow growth opportunities for\nparties. Collaborative, communicative, and problem-\nsolving features of ADR provides the government\nwith opportunities to rework and re-design\nexecutive, policy and regulatory decisions and\nprotocols. This can prevent floodgate of future\nlitigation on the same issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">4 Government Disputes and ADR: Overcoming\nPerceived Obstacles\n\n4.1. Despite the above benefits, Stakeholders have\nnot resorted to ADR in government disputes. This is\ndespite the policy commitment under the Karnataka\nLitigation Policy, 2011 as well as the National\nLitigation Policy, encouraging use of ADR in\nmanaging government disputes. Consultations with\nstakeholders revealed certain perceptions that acted\nas obstacles in their way of employing ADR\nmechanisms for government disputes. It is important\nto address and respond to these perceived obstacles\nand suggest measures to overcome them:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">4.1.1. Perceived Obstacle: ADR is inherently\nunsuitable for the public nature of government\ndisputes and government&#x27;s functions\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                      - 43 -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">                                     NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                   WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nResponse: It is important to distinguish between\ndisputes of public importance and disputes where\ngovernment      is   merely     an    involved     party.\nGovernment is a party to various contracts,\ncommercial transactions, employment agreements,\nindividual permits etc., where it only transacts with\nindividuals and addresses private interests. Further,\ngovernment disputes also include several intra-\ndepartment and inter-department disputes, disputes\nbetween PSUs and Department etc. These offer\nopportunities to introduce suitable ADR mechanisms.\nThe suggested measure to overcome this obstacle is\nto first understand the scope and suitability of each\nADR mechanism, (for example, for arbitrability, refer\nto the law <a href=\"/doc/127571616/\" id=\"a_45\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court);\nand thereafter systematically identify disputes or\ndispute areas suitable for ADR. Dispute Prevention\nmechanisms such as multi-stakeholder initiatives,\npublic consultations, etc., are also suitable for certain\ngovernment disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">4.1.2. Perceived Obstacle: Choice to resort to\nADR is not in government&#x27;s control (since\ngovernment is the respondent in most cases\nand the petitioner has already chosen\nlitigation).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">Response: The fact that government is the\nrespondent in majority of pending cases, must not\nprevent the government from attempting and\nincorporating ADR suitably. Two recommendations\ntackle the said obstacles: first, dispute prevention\nand early conflict redressal measures at the\nDepartment level, to prevent as many disputes\nreaching courts. (Consider grievance redressal\nsystems, Ombudsman, mediation, ADR clauses in\ncontracts etc.). Second, since courts are always\nencouraging of settlement, Law Officers and\nconcerned Departments must express willingness\nand commitment to explore possibilities of ADR for\nsuitable cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">4.1.3.   Perceived    Obstacle:   Individuals\nrepresenting the government do not have\nauthority to negotiate or agree to terms on\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">                     - 44 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">                                    NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                 WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\ngovernment&#x27;s behalf. Further, any agreement\nentered into by an individual officer, is\nvulnerable to attack as an underhanded deal.\n\nResponse: This is a common concern across all\nStakeholders and is most prevalent in exploring\nvoluntary     settlement-based      ADR,     such    as\nmediation/negotiation. Given that most Stakeholder\noffices are hierarchical, and require approvals at\nvarious levels, individual officers (e.g., briefing\nofficers/LCOs      in    Departments;       Government\nAdvocates/Pleaders in government Law Offices) are\nhesitant to assume authority to enter settlements on\nbehalf of the government. This is a valid concern:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">most voluntary settlement-based processes are only\neffective if the parties at the mediation/negotiation\ntable are those with authority to negotiate. However,\nmeasures can be taken to overcome this obstacle. It\nis important to develop predetermined protocols and\nstructures to assure authorization and accountability\nin the ADR process. This Policy recommends the\nconstitution of Dispute Resolution Board in each\nDepartment. The Board shall be constituted by\nDepartment officers/officials with official decision-\nmaking authority in the Department and may also\ninclude retired judicial members. The Board will issue\nauthorization and instructions to individual officers\nand Law Officers, to negotiate on behalf of the\nDepartment. Further, any settlement will be subject\nto review and approval by the Board. The Board shall\nalso ensure that all necessary approvals from other\nauthorities (such as Finance Department etc.) shall\nbe taken before entering into the settlement. This\nwill ensure effective authorized participation,\nmaintain accountability of the entire Department,\nwhile also protecting individual officers from baseless\nallegations. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134182438\" id=\"span_60\">In fact, such an authorization process is\nalso endorsed recently by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/134182438/\" id=\"a_46\">National Co-operative Development Corporation v.\nCommissioner of Income Tax, Delhi</a>.

Government Litigation Policy\nat the central and state levels fortify the legitimacy\nof ADR, offering adequate motivation to participate\nin       ADR    processes.      The       fact     that\nmediation/negotiation are voluntary processes,\nbased on party-autonomy and interests, indicates\nthat the government also has bargaining powers.\nThis assures that settlement from such processes\nonly results in closure and prevention of floodgate\nlitigation for the government and not a bad\nprecedent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">4.2. It is seen that most obstacles discussed above\nare long held perceptions of Stakeholders, reflective\nof a legal culture where litigation is predominant and\nADR mechanisms are relatively new and untested.\nTherefore, introducing ADR effectively is also a\nmatter of changing dispute resolution culture. While\nvarious measures to change the legal culture are\nsuggested here, the first step is to assess the\nsuitability of ADR mechanisms to disputes or dispute\nareas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">5.    Suitability  and     Identification              of\nDisputes/Dispute Areas for ADR\n\n5.1. ADR mechanisms cannot be blindly adopted for\nall disputes, i.e., irrespective of suitability. Assessing\nsuitability is important for three reasons: first,\ncertain disputes are considered by law to be\nunsuitable for certain ADR mechanisms; therefore,\nADR in such disputes will be legally invalid. Second,\nADR mechanisms are only effective when they are\nsuitable to prevent or resolve disputes. Third, each\nADR mechanism offers different benefits and\nStakeholders will benefit from choosing the right\nADR mechanism for their specific structures.\nTherefore, suitability is an important assessment\nthat leads to identification of areas or disputes for\nspecific ADR processes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">5.2. In case of government disputes, there are three\nstages at which suitability must be addressed. First,\nsuitability of ADR vis-Ã -vis the government&#x27;s role and\ncapacity to participate. Second, suitability of the area\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">                      - 46 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">                                     NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                   WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nof dispute for reference to ADR. Third, identifying\nand choosing the most suitable ADR mechanism for a\ngiven dispute or dispute area.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">5.3. Regarding the first stage, as discussed above, a\ngeneral perception that ADR itself is not suitable for\ngovernment disputes is misconceived and must be\novercome. In fact, in case of suits by or against the\ngovernment, <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_47\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> 1908,\nspecifically mandates the court to encourage\nsettlement. Order XXVII Rule 5B states that in suits\nagainst the government, &quot;it shall be the duty of the\ncourt&quot; to enable a settlement and also grant\nadditional adjournment in case any such settlement\nwas in progress. Therefore, the law has not only\nrecognized the suitability of ADR for government\ndisputes, but further mandated the court to\nencourage it. It is therefore recommended that\nStakeholders seriously consider these commitments\nand incorporate ADR mechanisms for government\ndisputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">5.4. Regarding the second stage of suitability, i.e.,\nbased on the area of dispute for ADR, it is\nrecommended         that    Stakeholders     incorporate\nsuitability standards subject to the limits <a href=\"/doc/134182438/\" id=\"a_48\">laid down\nby</a> law. For instance, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has\nevolved the test of &#x27;arbitrability&#x27; of disputes, i.e. the\nsuitability of arbitration to specific subject-matter of\ndisputes in several cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">5.5. Arbitrability standards have also been\nincorporated by several High Courts across the\ncountry in referring disputes to ADR.14 Stakeholders\nmust be guided by the above classification and\nstandard in identifying dispute areas that are\nsuitable for ADR. Each stakeholder Department, in\nconsultation with Law Officers, must undertake the\nexercise of identifying dispute areas suitable for\nADR, falling within the Department&#x27;s jurisdiction.\nThis exercise will reveal the dispute population which\nis available for ADR.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">5.6. Once that identification is complete, the third\nstage of suitability involves matching the dispute or\ndispute area with the most suitable ADR mechanism.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">                     - 47 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">                                   NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                 WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nSome disputes may be better determined by private\nadjudication such as arbitration, while certain\ndisputes are better resolved through a voluntary\nfacilitative settlement-based process. To ensure a\nsmart adoption of the right ADR mechanism,\nstakeholders,      particularly Departments,    must\ndevelop a suitable ADR strategy that aims at dispute\nprevention as well as dispute resolution. The\nfollowing section offers recommendations on the\nconsiderations to be employed while choosing ADR\nmechanisms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">6. Incorporating ADR in Government Dispute\nSystem\n\n6.1. In government disputes, ADR can be\nincorporated at two levels - first, at the Department\nlevel, where the conflict emerges (in case of inter-\ndepartmental disputes, ADR can be incorporated at\nthe time that the conflict emerges between\ndepartments); secondly, at adjudication level, where\nthe conflict is escalated and involves Law Officers\nrepresenting the government. Two objectives must\ndrive each of these two levels: dispute prevention\nand dispute resolution. It is recommended that there\nis an ADR strategy developed by Stakeholder\nRepresentatives at each of these levels.\n\n6.2.In order to resolve inter-departmental disputes,\ni.e., disputes arising between two or more State\nDepartments, there shall be an Inter-Departmental\nDispute Redressal Committee, headed by the Chief\nSecretary. The Inter-Departmental Dispute Redressal\nCommittee shall be an ad-hoc committee that shall\nbe constituted by such persons as the Chief\nSecretary or Additional Chief Secretary may appoint,\nto resolve specific disputes. The Committee shall use\nsuitable ADR mechanisms to address the conflict and\nresolve disputes, as far as practicable without resort\nto litigation. The Committee shall also recommend\nsuitable ways of resolving disputes without resort to\nlitigation. For instance, in high-stake or major cases\nwhere a Department is considering the suitability of\nfiling appeals or pursuing litigation, the Committee\nshall assist in providing its opinion on ADR\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">                    - 48 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                                  NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\nalternatives to resolve the dispute and end the\nconflict.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">6.3.Each Stakeholder Department shall develop an\nADR Strategy and ensure its implementation. The\nsaid ADR strategy shall be outlined and documented\nin each Department&#x27;s ADR Policy and/or ADR Plan.\nThere shall be an Inter-Departmental Alternative\nDispute Resolution Working Group, led by the Office\nof the Advocate General and consisting of\nrepresentatives    of    each   State   Department,\ngovernment Law Officers, and dispute resolution\nexperts (among lawyers, mediators, arbitrators and\nother professionals). The Working Group shall assist\nand facilitate each state Department in framing and\nimplementing its ADR strategy. The Working Group\nmay further create sections for implementation of\nADR in specific subject areas, especially those that\ninvolve multiple state Departments. For example, a\nsection on commercial contracts may involve the\nDepartment of Industries and Commerce, Mines and\nGeology Department etc.\n\n6.4.In addition, the Office of the Advocate General\nshall also incorporate ADR commitments of Law\nOfficers into the ADR Strategy, to ensure that Law\nOfficers identify ADR opportunities and implement\nthem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">6.5. In formulating the ADR strategy and drafting the\nADR Policy and Document, the following shall be\nconsidered as necessary components:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">6.5.1. Policy Commitment: Each Stakeholder shall\nexpress a policy commitment to incorporate ADR\nsuitably. This policy commitment may be expressed\nin the ADR policy document of each Stakeholder or\nby making a Policy Statement. Further, as part of its\nADR strategy, each Stakeholder Department must\nconsider how to include ADR in the draft legislations\nand policies under its jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">6.5.2. Contractual Commitment: Each Stakeholder\nshall consider the inclusion of ADR clauses in\ngovernment contracts. The clause may indicate at a\nsingle ADR mechanism (eg: single option to\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                     - 49 -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\">                                   NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                 WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\narbitrate) or lay out a multi-level ADR structure (eg:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">first negotiate; on negotiation failure, attempt third\nparty mediation; on mediation failure, resort to\nadjudication). ADR strategy documents must advise\nand provide draft templates.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">6.5.3. Identification of Disputes/Dispute areas\nfor ADR: Each stakeholder Department shall, in\nconsultation with the Law Officers, identify disputes/\ndispute areas that are suitable for ADR. In doing so,\na reasonable metric or model may be adopted to\ndetermine which disputes must be referred to ADR.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">For instance, metrics may be based on value, risk,\nissues involved, classes of parties involved etc.\nStakeholders will benefit from using the data\nmanagement system to tag and identify cases\nsuitable for ADR.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">6.5.4. Dispute Prevention: Each Department shall\nformulate a suitable dispute prevention plan, to\nprovide early stage conflict resolution. Various\nmechanisms such as Grievance Redressal Officers,\nOmbudsperson,       Expert    Panels,   Stakeholder\nCommittees, Mediation etc., are suitable as dispute\nprevention mechanisms. Each Department shall, with\nthe assistance of the Working Group, evolve a\nsuitable dispute prevention system customized to its\nrequirements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">6.5.5. Setting Suitable ADR Models: In adopting\nan ADR mechanism, Stakeholders shall consider\ndifferent models in designing the ADR. For instance,\nin case of Ombudsperson, in some cases, single\ndecision-maker model is adopted with a single\nOmbudsperson to process all complaint. Some other\nmodels adopt an Ombudsperson Panel approach.\n\n6.5.6. Participation Protocol in Settlement-\nBased Processes: As suggested above, the ADR\nstrategy must involve a participation protocol, which\neases authorization process and provides a level of\nimmunity to the officer involved in the ADR process.\nDispute Resolution Boards aid such participation.\nADR Strategy must address such additional\nprotocols.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">                     - 50 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">                                    NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                 WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n6.5.7. Preserving Foundational Tenets of ADR:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">Most ADR mechanisms such as arbitration, mediation\nand negotiation have very set foundational tenets. In\nmediation, party autonomy, self-determination and\nneutrality are integral to the process. It must be\nensured that these foundational tenets are followed\nin government disputes. This is also important to\nconsider in designing ADR systems. For instance,\ntoday most Ombudsman Schemes, such as Banking\nOmbudsman       Scheme,     2006   and     Insurance\nOmbudsman Scheme provide for the Ombudsman to\nact both as the mediator and adjudicatory authority\non the same complaint. This compromises party-\nautonomy in the settlement process, for fear of\nadverse award if a settlement as advised by the\nOmbudsman is rejected.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">6.5.8. ADR Knowledge and Training: In\nappointment of HLCs and Law Officers, their\nknowledge of ADR shall be one of the factors for\nconsideration. Further, all Stakeholders shall commit\nto training programs on ADR to increase learning and\nshare knowledge on incorporating ADR into their\nsystems.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">6.5.9. Budget and Staffing: Each Stakeholder must\ndetermine      the    budget    for   the   effective\nimplementation of its ADR strategy and make all\nattempts to seek approval of the budget. Further,\neach Stakeholder Department must also consider its\nadditional staffing needs to seek the necessary\nhuman resource support for its ADR efforts. This\nmust also include designation of dispute resolution\nexperts and counsels to assist in designing the ADR\nstructure or to assist on complex matters.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">6.5.10.   Performance        Evaluation     of   ADR:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">Stakeholders must ensure that evaluation models on\nADR do not merely cover disposal and settlement\nrates. High disposal rate is not the ultimate objective\nof ADR, but merely a benefit. Therefore, success\nevaluation must also be based on whether the\nfoundational principles have been followed in the\nADR process. Performance Indicators must therefore\nbe placed to evaluate these considerations as well.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                                 - 51 -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                                               NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                              WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">             7. While previous litigation policies recommend ADR,\n             Stakeholders have failed to adequately resort to\n             ADR, since there has been no commitment towards\n             systematic strategy and implementation. It is\n             necessary that ADR for government disputes is not\n             merely a paper goal but an implementable measure\n             and a strategic choice. Therefore, Stakeholders must\n             focus     on     rigorously       implementing   the\n             recommendations in this chapter to make real\n             progress in adopting ADR for government disputes.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">13.   A perusal of the same would indicate that ADR\n\n      options are designed to prevent dispute escalation\n\n      and thereby to prevent litigation in relation thereto.\n\n      The policy also takes into account the hesitation on\n\n      part of the officers to take up ADR settlement\n\n      processes      on    account       of   apprehended     false\n\n      allegations against them and it is in that background\n\n      that    an   Inter-departmental         Dispute   Resolution\n\n      Working Group is contemplated which is required to\n\n      assist each Department in evolving an ADR Strategy\n\n      and identifying disputes/dispute areas suitable for\n\n      ADR. The typology of ADR mechanisms also having\n\n      extracted hereinabove, it is required that the same is\n\n      implemented.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">                                  - 52 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">                                                  NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">14.   As observed in the said policy itself any reform is\n\n      only as good as its implementation and as such it\n\n      becomes imperative that a reformative policy as\n\n      contained      under     the     Karnataka     State   Dispute\n\n      Resolution Policy, 2021 is implemented, if not in\n\n      totality to the extent possible.

A perusal of the above would indicate the manner in\n\n      which any doubt or perceived obstacles could be\n\n      overcome by the department or by the officer at the\n\n      time of resolving the dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">16.   Clause   (6)    of     chapter      VII   thereof   deals   with\n\n      incorporating ADR in Government Dispute System\n\n      which requires ADR to be restored firstly at the time\n\n      conflict emerges and secondly at adjudication level.\n\n      Thus, the emphasis now is on disputes/litigation\n\n      containment at the time when conflict arises, so that\n\n      same does not escalate to a full-fledged dispute\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">                                 - 53 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">                                                NC: 2023:KHC:35353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                              WP No. 7725 of 2023</span>\n\n\n\n\n      before a Court or an arbitral forum.
