Objections to amendment having found favour led the Court\nreject the application for amendment by impugned order by taking\ninto consideration the fact that the objector having not questioned the\nappointment of Arbitrator which, in turn, was by virtue of order by the\nHigh Court in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/120593364/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11(6)</a> of AC Act and thus,\nacquiesced to the proceedings is estopped from raising the objections\nwhich, if allowed, would swipe the very appointment of the Arbitrator.\nIn order words, the objection as to jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, if\nallowed, to be taken the same would tantamount to question the\ncorrectness of order under <a href=\"/doc/120593364/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(6)</a> of AC Act, which attained\nfinality. The Court also found that the preliminary objection raised at\nthe stage of <a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a> of AC Act also suffers from limitation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.

Since it is not in dispute that the contract in question is works\ncontract; therefore, before dwelling on the contentions and counter\ncontentions, and the effect of clause 16 in the agreement opportune it\nwould to first take note of the law relating to work contract as it is\napplicable in the State of Madhya Pradesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">10.    That, the M.P.

It provided for\ncompulsory arbitration. It provides for a reference. The Tribunal has\nthe power of rejecting the reference at the threshold. It provides for a\nspecial limitation.

The provisions of the Act referred to hereinbefore\n       clearly postulate that the State of Madhya Pradesh has\n       created a separate forum for the purpose of\n       determination of disputes arising inter alia out of the\n       works contract. The Tribunal is not one which can be\n       said to be a Domestic Tribunal. The Members of the\n       Tribunal are not nominated by the parties. The\n       disputants do not have any control over their\n       appointment. The Tribunal may reject a reference at\n       the threshold. It has the power to summon records. It\n       has the power to record evidence. Its functions are not\n       limited to one Bench. The Chairman of the Tribunal can\n       refer the disputes to another Bench. Its decision is\n       final. It can award costs. It can award interests. The\n       finality of the decision is fortified by a legal fiction\n       created by making an Award a decree of a Civil Court.\n       It is executable as a decree of a Civil Court. The Award\n       of the Arbitral Tribunal is not subject to the provisions\n       of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_19\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_20\">Arbitration and\n       Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.

In this case it is not in\n      dispute that the contract between the parties\n      contained an arbitration clause (clause 29). The\n      decision of the High Court that the provisions of the\n      1983 Adhiniyam would apply and sole arbitrator\n      appointed by the designate of the Chief Justice lacked\n      inherent jurisdiction, cannot therefore be sustained.\n      Though the said Arbitration clause provided for\n      reference of disputes to a three member Arbitration\n      Board, the designate chose to appoint a sole arbitrator\n      and that order dated 11.5.2007 attained finality.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"166421160\" id=\"span_5\">14.   However, the aspect of applicability of the Act of 1983 or the\nAct of 1996 in a &#x27;works contract&#x27; came to be considered in <a href=\"/doc/166421160/\" id=\"a_23\">Madhya\nPradesh   Rural   Road     Development    Authority   &amp;   another   vs.\nL.G.Chaudhary Engineers &amp; Contractors</a> : (2012) 3 SCC 495 wherein\nafter taking into consideration the provisions of Act 1983 being saved\n                                  :: 6 ::</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                      Writ Petition No.4559/2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">under <a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(4)</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_25\">2(5)</a> of 1996 Act declared the decision in Va\nTech (supra) being per incuriam, holding :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;18. If this Court compares the provisions of the\n      M.P. Act with A.C. Act 1996 then the Court finds\n      that the provisions of M.P. Act are inconsistent with\n      the provisions of A.C. Act 1996. The M.P. Act is a\n      special law providing for statutory arbitration in the\n      State of Madhya Pradesh even in the absence of\n      arbitration agreement. Under the provisions of A.C.\n      Act 1996 in the absence of an arbitration\n      agreement, arbitration is not possible. There is also\n      difference in the formation of arbitration tribunal as\n      is clear from Section 2(1)(d) of A.C. Act 1996.\n      Again under A.C. Act 1996, arbitral tribunal is\n      defined under <a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2(1)(d)</a> as a sole arbitrator\n      or a panel of arbitrators. But under M.P. Act such a\n      tribunal is created under <a href=\"/doc/181251736/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/122942769/\" id=\"a_28\">4</a> of the\n      Act. And under the M.P. Act dispute has a special\n      meaning as defined under <a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 2(1)(d)</a> of the\n      Act whereas dispute has not been defined under\n      the A.C. Act 1996.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      19 . It is clear from its long title that the M.P. Act\n      provides :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      &quot; .... for the establishment of a tribunal to arbitrate\n      in disputes to which the State Government or a\n      public undertaking [wholly or substantially owned\n      or controlled by the State Government], is a party,\n      and for matters incidental thereto or connected\n      therewith.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">      20. The structure of the Tribunal under the Madhya\n      Pradesh Act is also different from the structure of a\n      Tribunal under the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_30\">AC Act, 1996</a> ..... &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      23. It is clear from the aforesaid enumeration of\n      the statutory provisions that under the M.P.

It is clear, therefore, that in view of the\n      aforesaid finding of a co-ordinate Bench of this\n      Court on the distinct feature of an arbitral tribunal\n                           :: 7 ::\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">               Writ Petition No.4559/2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_6\">under the said M.P.

This\nCourt while rendering the decision in Va Tech\n(supra) has not either noticed the previous decision\nof a co-ordinate Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1189990/\" id=\"a_31\">Anshuman\nShukla</a> (supra) or the provisions of Section 2(4) of\nA.C. Act 1996.</span> Therefore, we are constrained to\nhold that the decision of this Court in Va Tech\n(supra) was rendered per incuriam.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">39. The M.P. Act of 1983 was made when the\nprevious <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_32\">Arbitration Act</a> of 1940 was in the field.\n<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_33\">That Act</a> of 1940 was a Central Law. Both the Acts\noperated in view of Section 46 of 1940 Act. The\nM.P. Act 1983 was reserved for the assent of the\nPresident and admittedly received the same on\n17.10.1983 which was published in the Madhya\nPradesh Gazette Extraordinary dated 12.10.1983.\nTherefore, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 254(2)</a> of the\nConstitution was satisfied. Thus, M.P. Act of 1983\nprevails in the State of Madhya Pradesh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"674147\" id=\"span_7\">Thereafter, A.C. Act 1996 was enacted by\nParliament repealing the earlier laws of arbitration\nof 1940. It has also been noted that A.C. Act 1996\nsaves the provisions 24 of M.P. Act 1983 under\nsub-<a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_35\">sections 2(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_36\">2(5)</a> thereof. Therefore,\nthere cannot be any repugnancy.

It is clear from the aforesaid observation that in\ninstant case the latter Act made by the Parliament\ni.e. A.C. Act 1996 clearly showed an intention to\nthe effect that the State Law of Arbitration i.e. the\nM.P. Act should operate in the State of Madhya\nPradesh in respect of certain specified types of\narbitrations which are under the M.P. Act 1983.\nThis is clear from Sections 2(4) and 2(5) of A.C. Act\n1996. Therefore, there is no substance in the\nargument of repugnancy and is accordingly\nrejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">42. Therefore, appeal is allowed and the judgment\nof the High Court which is based on the reasoning\nof Va Tech (supra) is set aside. This Court holds\n                                :: 8 ::\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                     Writ Petition No.4559/2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      the decision in Va Tech (supra) has been rendered\n      in per incuriam. In that view of the matter the\n      arbitration proceeding may proceed under M.P. Act\n      of 1983 and not under A.C. Act 1996.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">15.   This view that in respect of works contract it is the Tribunal\nconstituted under 1983 Act and no other forum is available was\nconcurred with by Hon&#x27;ble Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra in the following\nterms :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      &quot;49. In view of this, the legal and logical\n      consequence which can be reasonably drawn from\n      the definition of &#x27;works contract&#x27; would be, that if\n      there is a dispute between the contracting parties\n      for any reason relating to works contract which\n      include execution of any work, relating to\n      construction, repair or maintenance of any building\n      or super-structure, dam, weir, canal, reservoir,\n      tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory,\n      workshop, power house, transformers or such\n      other works of the State Government or Public\n      Undertaking including an agreement for the supply\n      of goods or material and all other matters relating\n      to the execution of any of the said works, the same\n      would fall within the ambit of the definition of\n      &#x27;works contract&#x27; and hence all disputes pertaining\n      or arising out of execution of the works contract\n      will have to be referred to the M.P. State\n      Arbitration Tribunal as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/102425510/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 7</a>\n      of the Act of 1983. Hence, in addition to the\n      reasons assigned in the judgment and order of\n      learned Brother Justice Ganguly, disputes arising\n      out of execution of works contract has to be\n      referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal and\n      not under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_39\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n      1996</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">16.   Thus, there remains no iota of doubt that in case of works\ncontract covered by the provisions of 1983 Act, any dispute is\ncompulsorily has to be raised before the Tribunal constituted under\n                                 :: 9 ::\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                     Writ Petition No.4559/2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">the Act of 1983 which necessarily means that the forum under 1996\nAct are excluded.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">17.   The question would then be whether in a given case, as the\npresent one, where the parties have entered into a contract State\nGovernment or a public undertaking wholly or substantially owned or\ncontrolled by the State Government, as in the case at hand, agrees to\na forum under 1996 Act, are they bound by it and any action thereon\ncould be termed to be within jurisdiction.

A Bench of seven judges per\n      majority construed meaning of the word\n      &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27;, Mukharji, J. as he then was, speaking\n      per himself. Oza and Natarajan, JJ. held that the\n      power to create or enlarge jurisdiction is legislative\n      in character. So also the power to confer a right of\n      appeal or to take away a right of appeal. The\n      Parliament alone can do it, by law and not Court,\n      whether superior or inferior or both combined, can\n      enlarge the jurisdiction of a Court and divest a\n      person of his rights of appeal or revision.\n      Ranganath Mishra, J. as he then was, held that\n                                  :: 10 ::</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                      Writ Petition No.4559/2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       jurisdiction comes solely from the law of the land\n       and cannot be exercised otherwise. In this country,\n       jurisdiction can be exercised only when provided\n       for either in the Constitution or in the laws made\n       by the Legislature. Jurisdiction is thus the authority\n       or power of the Court to deal with a matter and\n       make an order carrying binding force in the facts.\n       Oza, J. supplementing the question held that the\n       jurisdiction to try a case could only be conferred by\n       law enacted by the legislature. The Supreme Court\n       could not confer jurisdiction if it does not exist in\n       law. Ray, J. held that the Court cannot confer a\n       jurisdiction on itself which is not provided in the\n       law. In the dissenting opinion Venkatachaliah, J.,\n       as he then was, lay down that the expression\n       jurisdiction or prior determination is a &quot;verbal coat\n       of many colours&quot;. In the case of a Tribunal an\n       error of law might become not merely an error in\n       jurisdiction but might partake of the character of\n       an error of jurisdiction. But, otherwise, jurisdiction\n       is a &#x27;legal shelter&#x27; and a power to bind despite a\n       possible error in the decision. The existence of\n       jurisdiction does not depend on the correctness of\n       its exercise. The authority to decide embodies a\n       privilege to bind despite error, a privilege which is\n       inherent in and indispensable to every judicial\n       function. The characteristic attribute of a judicial\n       act is that it binds whether it be right or it be\n       wrong. Thus this Court laid down as an\n       authoritative proposition of law that the jurisdiction\n       could be conferred by statute and this Court\n       cannot confer jurisdiction or an authority on a\n       tribunal. In that case this Court held that\n       Constitution Bench has no power to give direction\n       contrary to <a href=\"/doc/544006/\" id=\"a_43\">Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952</a>.\n       The direction per majority was held to be void.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">19.

We are unable to uphold the contention. The\n       jurisdiction of a court may be classified into several\n       categories. The important categories are (i)\n       Territorial or local jurisdiction; (ii) Pecuniary\n       jurisdiction; and (iii) Jurisdiction over the subject\n       matter. So far as territorial and pecuniary\n       jurisdictions are concerned, objection to such\n       jurisdiction has to be taken at the earliest possible\n       opportunity and in any case at or before\n       settlement of issues. The law is well settled on the\n       point that if such objection is not taken at the\n       earliest, it cannot be allowed to be taken at a\n       subsequent stage. Jurisdiction as to subject\n       matter, however, is totally distinct and stands on a\n       different footing. Where a court has no jurisdiction\n       over the subject matter of the suit by reason of\n       any limitation imposed by statute, charter or\n       commission, it cannot take up the cause or matter.\n       An order passed by a court having no jurisdiction\n       is nullity.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       32. In Bahrein Petroleum Co., this Court also held\n       that neither consent nor waiver nor acquiescence\n       can confer jurisdiction upon a court, otherwise\n       incompetent to try the suit. It is well-settled and\n       needs no authority that &#x27;where a court takes upon\n       itself to exercise a jurisdiction it does not possess,\n       its decision amounts to nothing.&#x27; A decree passed\n       by a court having no jurisdiction is non-est and its\n       validity can be set up whenever it is sought to be\n       enforced as a foundation for a right, even at the\n       stage of execution or in collateral proceedings. A\n       decree passed by a court without jurisdiction is a\n       coram non judice.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">21.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"526957\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/526957/\" id=\"a_48\">Bal Mukund Bairwa</a> (2) (supra) there Lordships were pleased\nto hold :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                                 :: 12 ::\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">                     Writ Petition No.4559/2014.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">      &quot;50. We may also observe that the application of\n      doctrine of prospective overruling in Krishna Kant\n      may not be correct because either a court has the\n      requisite jurisdiction or it does not have. It is well\n      settled principle of law that the court cannot confer\n      jurisdiction where there is none and neither can the\n      parties confer jurisdiction upon a court by consent.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">      If a court decides a matter without jurisdiction as\n      has rightly been pointed out in Zakir Hussain in\n      view of the seven-Judge Bench decision of this\n      Court in A.R. Antulay, the same would be nullity\n      and, thus, the doctrine of prospective overruling\n      shall not apply in such cases. Even otherwise\n      doctrine of prospective overruling has a limited\n      application. It ordinarily applies where a statute is\n      declared ultra vires and not in a case where the\n      decree or order is passed by a court/tribunal in\n      respect whereof it had no jurisdiction.

A decree passed\n      by such a court in a nullity and is non-est. Its\n      invalidity can be set up whenever it is sought to be\n      enforced or is acted upon as a foundation for a\n      right, even at the stage of execution or in collateral\n      proceedings.
