One party\n\nto a contract cannot unilaterally assess the damages. But in these\n\ncases, the state challenges this proposition based on certain\n\ndecisions of the apex court. Since these two writ petitions are\n\nconnected, I am disposing of these two writ petitions by a\n\ncommon judgment.            I will first narrate the facts in WP(C)\n\nNo.31363 of 2009.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\"> W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019              6</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">     2. The petitioner was awarded the construction work of\n\nbreak waters in connection with the Ponnani Fisheries Harbour\n\nProject of the State Government. As per the terms of the\n\nagreement entered into by the petitioner with the Government in\n\nconnection with the execution of work referred above, the\n\npetitioner ought to have completed the work on or before\n\n31.3.2007.     The case of the petitioner is that due to various\n\nreasons attributable exclusively to the respondents, the work\n\ncould not be completed in full within the time stipulated.    For\n\ncompleting the remaining part of the work, a minimum period of\n\nseven months further was required at that point of time. Hence,\n\nthe petitioner on 7.2.2007 submitted an application for an\n\nextension of time. It is the case of the petitioner that since the\n\nreason for non-completion of the work was not attributable to the\n\npetitioner, the Harbour Engineering Department under which the\n\nwork was executed recommended to the Government that time\n\nsought for by the petitioner can be granted. Consequently, based\n\non Ext P1 Government Order,the Government allowed the request\n\nfor extension of time but imposed a fine @ Rs.21,956/- per day for\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    7</span>\n\n\ncompletion of the remaining part of the work. It is the case of\n\nthe petitioner that the fine imposed by the Government as per\n\nExt P1 order was approximately 1 crore and the same was even\n\nfar above the anticipated profit of the petitioner.             Hence, the\n\npetitioner again approached the Government to modify Ext P1\n\norder and to permit them to complete the work without a fine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">Subsequently, Ext P2 Government Order was passed based on\n\nthe direction in Ext P3 judgment of this court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">     3. Thereafter, it is the case of the petitioner that the 1st\n\nrespondent illegally directed to terminate the contract by Ext P2\n\norder.    The termination of the contract effected by the 2 nd\n\nrespondent     on   29.4.2005      at   the    risk    and    cost   denying\n\nunconditional     extension   of   time       sought   from    1.4.2007   to\n\n31.12.2007. The respondents issued a notice inviting tenders for\n\nthe balance work. Pursuant to Ext P3 judgment, the Government\n\nconducted a hearing on the issue of termination of the contract\n\nand in the course of the hearing, the petitioner contended that\n\nthey had not committed any breach of the terms of the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">It is the case of the petitioner that without considering the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019               8</span>\n\n\ncontentions of the petitioner, the Government restored its earlier\n\ndecision as per Ext P4. Since a substantial amount is due to the\n\npetitioner, the petitioner decided to file a suit, and a Section 80\n\nCivil Procedure Code notice was issued as evident by Ext P5.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">The Government sends a reply as per Ext P6.         Thereafter, the\n\npetitioner was taking steps to file the suit.    At that stage, the\n\npetitioner received Ext P7 notice from the 4 th respondent stating\n\nthat the petitioner is liable to pay a sum of Rs.4,34,12,105/- to\n\nthe Government in connection with the rearranging of the work\n\nreferred to above and directing them to pay the same to the\n\nGovernment. The petitioner sent Ext P8 reply. In Ext P8, the\n\npetitioner also stated that Government cannot determine the\n\nissue as to who has committed the breach of the terms of the\n\ncontract, and therefore, determination of the alleged loss made\n\nby the Government on that basis is illegal. It is the case of the\n\npetitioner that after the award of contract for the balance work\n\non 4.12.2008, Ext P4 order dated 12.12.2008 was passed by the\n\n1st respondent affirming the termination of the contract at risk\n\nand cost willfully suppressing the material facts. Ext P9 is a letter\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                  9</span>\n\n\nsent by the petitioner demanding the payment of the unpaid\n\nvalue of work carried out, which was modified by a letter dated\n\n15.4.2011.    Ext P10 is the letter from the Executive Engineer\n\ndated 2.5.2011 to the 4th respondent transmitting Ext P9 for\n\nfurther action.      Ext P11 is another representation for the\n\npetitioner which was returned for presentation before the\n\nExecutive Engineer, Malappuram.             Ext P12 is a notice-cum-bill\n\nsubmitted by the petitioner to the respondents demanding\n\npayment of Rs. 11,67, 41,925/-. It is the case of the petitioner\n\nthat the Government of Kerala issued Ext P13 circular directing\n\nto obtain decree from the civil court before initiating revenue\n\nrecovery     proceedings    for   claiming     damages    at     the   time\n\ntermination of the contract on risk and cost.           As per Ext P10\n\njudgment, this Court directed the Government to take a decision\n\nin Ext P10 representation. As per Ext P15, the Government\n\ndeclined the payment demanded and also declined the request\n\nfor the appointment of an arbitraral tribunal for resolution of the\n\ndispute. Exts P16 and P17 are the other representations\n\nsubmitted     by   the   petitioner   before     the   Hon&#x27;ble    Minister\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019              10</span>\n\n\n(Fisheries) and the 1st respondent. There was no reply to those\n\nrepresentations. Thereafter Ext P18 notice was issued by the\n\npetitioner demanding payment due to the petitioner with\n\ninterest. The Government of Kerala issued Ext P19 directing to\n\nallow extension of time for completing works delayed without\n\nimposing fine in the event of all bills presented for the value of\n\nwork carried out remains unpaid. It is the case of the petitioner\n\nthat, Ext P1 order was passed imposing a fine of Rs.36.44 lakhs\n\nfor allowing extension of time from 1.4.2007 to 31.10.2007 and\n\nthereafter at Rs.21,956/- per day withholding Rs.1,58,75,214/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">payable to the petitioner. Ext P20 is the revised estimate of work\n\nand Ext P21 is the copy of the preliminary specification in MDSS\n\nforming part of the agreement. It is submitted that Exts P22 and\n\nP23 revenue recovery proceedings were initiated to recover the\n\namount when the interim order staying all further proceedings\n\nbased on Ext P7 was in force.       In such circumstances, the\n\npetitioner submits that this writ petition is filed with the\n\nfollowing prayers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\"> W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    11</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">           (i).issue a writ of certiorari, or any other appropriate\n           writ, direction or order calling for the records\n           leading to Exhibit P7 notice No.D1/1643/2000/EE,\n           dated 28-5-2009 of the fourth respondent and\n           quashing the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">           (ii).issue a writ of certiorari or any other appropriate\n           writ, or order to quash Ext.

There are in the main two grounds on which the\n           learned Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the\n           appellant, challenged the order of interim injunction\n           made by Mr. Justice Avadh Bihari.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">           A. The impugned order amounted in effect and\n           substance to an order directing the appellant to pay\n           the amounts of the pending bills of the respondent in\n           respect of the other contracts and since the question\n           of payment of the amounts of such pending bills did\n           not form the subject matter of the reference which\n           was pending before the arbitrator, the-learned-Judge\n           had no jurisdiction under Section 41 read with the\n           Second Schedule to make such an order and the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    17</span>\n\n\n           impugned order was, therefore, outside the scope of\n           his power and hence invalid.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">           B. Clause 18 comes into play when there is a claim\n           for payment of a sum of, money arising out of or\n           under the contract. It is not necessary that the sum\n           of money must be due and payable to the purchaser.\n           It is enough if there is a claim even for damages.\n           Whenever there is such claim, the purchaser is given\n           a right under Clause 18 to recover it by\n           appropriating &quot;any sum then due or which at any\n           time thereafter may become due to the contractor\n           under the contract&quot; or under any other contract. The\n           appellant was, therefore, entitled to recover the\n           amount of its claim for damages against the\n           respondent by appropriating the sums which\n           subsequently became due to the respondent under\n           other contracts, even though the claim for damages\n           was contested by the respondent and was pending\n           adjudication before the arbitrator. No interim\n           injunction could be granted to prevent the exercise of\n           such right. If interim injunction were to be granted in\n           a case of this kind as of course merely on the ground,\n           without anything more, that the claim for damages is\n           pending adjudication and until it is determined in\n           favour of the purchaser, it should not be allowed to\n           be recovered by the purchaser out of other sums due\n           to the contractor, it would render Clause 18\n           meaningless and ineffectual and the right to the\n           purchaser under that clause would become illusory.\n           Of course, it would be open to the Court even in such\n           a case to grant interim injunction, if it is satisfied\n           that the claim for damages is prima facie not well\n           founded and the balance of convenience requires\n           that, pending adjudication, the purchaser should be\n           restrained from effecting recovery of the claim for\n           damages from out of other sums due to the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                     18</span>\n\n\n           contractor. But here admittedly neither of these two\n           factors was taken into consideration by the learned\n           Judges and the order of interim injunction made by\n           him cannot, therefore, be sustained.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_35\">9.

The learned counsel Shri Kacker, however,\n           strongly relied on the following observations of the\n           Court in <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_28\">Union of India v. Raman Iron Foundry</a>(SCC\n           p.238, para6):</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                 &quot;But here the order of interim injunction\n                 made by the learned Judge does not\n                 expressly or by necessary implication, carry\n                 any direction to the appellant to pay the\n                 amounts due to the respondent under other\n                 contracts. It is not only in form but also in\n                 substance a negative injunction. It has no\n                 positive content. What it does is merely to\n                 injunct the appellant from recovering, suo\n                 motu, the damages claimed by it from out of\n                 other amounts due to the respondent. It\n                 does not direct that the appellant shall pay\n                 such amounts to the respondents. The\n                 appellant can still refuse to pay such\n                 amounts if it thinks it has a valid defence\n                 and if the appellant does so, the only\n                 remedy open to the respondent would be to\n                 take measures in an appropriate forum for\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                     19</span>\n\n\n                 recovery of such amounts where it would be\n                 decided whether the appellant is liable to\n                 pay such amounts to the respondent or not.\n                 No breach of the order of interim injunction\n                 as such would be involved in non payment\n                 of such amounts by the appellant to the\n                 respondent. The only thing which the\n                 appellant is interdicted from doing is to\n                 make recovery of its claim for damages by\n                 appropriating such amounts in satisfaction\n                 of the claim. That is clearly within the\n                 power of the Court under S.41(b) because\n                 the claim for damages forms the subject\n                 matter of the arbitration proceedings and\n                 the Court can always say that until such\n                 claim is adjudicated upon, the appellant\n                 shall be restrained from recovering it by\n                 appropriating other amounts due to the\n                 respondent. The order of interim injunction\n                 made by the learned Judge cannot,\n                 therefore, be said to be outside the scope of\n                 his power under S.41(b) read with the\n                 Second Schedule.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_41\">With profound respect we find that the aforesaid\n           observation is incongruous with the proposition of\n           law <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_29\">laid down by</a> this Court just before this\n           observation.

Having discussed the proper interpretation of\n           clause 18, we may now turn to consider what is the\n           real nature of the claim for recovery of which the\n           appellant is seeking to appropriate the sums due to\n           the respondent under other contracts. The claim is\n           admittedly one for damages for breach of the\n           contract between the parties. Now, it is true that the\n           damages which are claimed are liquidated damages\n           under clause 14, but so far as the law in India is\n           concerned, there is no qualitative difference in the\n           nature of the claim whether it be for liquidated\n           damages or for unliquidated damages. <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_35\">S.74</a> of the\n           Indian Contract Act eliminates the somewhat\n           elaborate refinements made under the English\n           common law in distinguishing between stipulations\n           providing for payment of liquidated damages and\n           stipulations in the nature of penalty. Under the\n           common law a genuine pre-estimate of damages by\n           mutual agreement is regarded as a stipulation\n           naming liquidated damages and binding between the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                   21</span>\n\n\n           parties; a stipulation in a contract in terrorem is a\n           penalty and the Court refuses to enforce it,\n           awarding to the aggrieved party only reasonable\n           compensation. The Indian Legislature has sought to\n           cut across the web of rules and presumptions under\n           the English common law, by enacting a uniform\n           principle applicable to all stipulations naming\n           amounts to be paid in case of breach, and\n           stipulations by way of penalty, and according to this\n           principle, even if there is a stipulation by way of\n           liquidated damages, a party complaining of breach\n           of    contract    can    recover    only   reasonable\n           compensation for the injury sustained by him, the\n           stipulated amount being merely the outside limit. It,\n           therefore makes no difference in the present case\n           that the claim of the appellant is for liquidated\n           damages. It stands on the same footing as a claim\n           for unliquidated damages. Now the law is well\n           settled that a claim for unliquidated damages does\n           not give rise to a debt until the liability is\n           adjudicated and damages assessed by a decree or\n           order of a Court or other adjudicatory authority.\n           When there is a breach of contract, the party who\n           commits the breach does not eo instanti incur any\n           pecuniary obligation, nor does the party complaining\n           of the breach become party. The only right which\n           the party aggrieved by the breach of the contract\n           has is the right to sue for damages. That is not an\n           actionable claim and this position is made amply\n           clear by the amendment in<a href=\"/doc/1563813/\" id=\"a_36\"> S.6(e)</a> of the Transfer of\n           Property Act, which provides that a mere right to\n           sue for damages cannot be transferred. This has\n           always been the law in England and as far back as\n           1858 we find it stated by Wightman, J., in Jones v.\n           Thompson, (1858) 27 LJQB 234. &quot;Ex parte Charles\n           and several other cases decide that the amount of a\n           verdict in an action for unliquidated damages is not\n           a debt till judgment has been signed.&quot; It was held in\n           this case that a claim for damages does not become\n           a debt even after the jury has returned a verdict in\n           favour of the plaintiff till the judgment is actually\n           delivered. So also in O&#x27;Driscoll v. Manchester\n           Insurance Committee, 1915 (3) KB 499. Swinfen\n           Eady, L., J., said in reference to cases where the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    22</span>\n\n\n           claim was for unliquidated damages &quot;....... in such\n           cases there is no debt at all until the verdict of the\n           jury is pronounced assessing the damages and\n           judgment is given&quot;.

J., in the last mentioned\n           case, stated the law in these terms:(at pp.425-26)\n                 &quot;In my opinion it would not be true to say that\n           a person who commits a breach of the contract\n           incurs any pecuniary liability, nor would it be true to\n           say that the other party to the contract who\n           complains of the breach has any amount due to him\n           from the other party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                 As already stated, the only right which he has\n           is the right to go to a Court of law and recover\n           damages. Now, damages are the compensation\n           which a Court of law gives to a party for the injury\n           which he has sustained. But, and this is most\n           important to note, he does not get damages or\n           compensation by reason of any existing obligation on\n           the part of the person who has committed the\n           breach. He gets compensation as a result of the fiat\n           of the Court. Therefore, no pecuniary liability arises\n           till the Court has determined that the party\n           complaining of the breach is entitled to damages.\n           Therefore, when damages are assessed, it would not\n           be true to say that what the Court is doing is\n           ascertaining a pecuniary liability which already\n           existed. The Court in the first place must decide that\n           the defendant is liable and then it proceeds to assess\n           what that liability is. But till that determination\n           there is no liability at all upon the defendant.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                 This statement in our view represents the\n           correct legal position and has our full concurrence.\n           A claim for damages for breach of contract is,\n           therefore, not a claim for a sum presently due and\n           payable and the purchaser is not entitled, in exercise\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                   23</span>\n\n\n           of the right conferred upon it under clause 18, to\n           recover the amount of such claim by appropriating\n           other sums due to the contractor. On this view, it is\n           not necessary for us to consider the other contention\n           raised on behalf of the respondent, namely, that on a\n           proper construction of clause 18, the purchaser is\n           entitled to exercise the right conferred under that\n           clause only where the claim for payment of a sum of\n           money is either admitted by the contractor, or in\n           case of dispute, adjudicated upon by a Court or\n           other adjudicatory authority. We must, therefore,\n           hold that the appellant had no right or authority\n           under Clause 18 to appropriate the amounts of other\n           pending bill of the respondent in or towards\n           satisfaction of its claim for damages against the\n           respondent and the learned Judge was justified in\n           issuing an interim injunction restraining the\n           appellant from doing so.&quot; (underline supplied)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">     11. The Apex Court held that when there is a breach of\n\ncontract, the party who commits the breach does not incur any\n\npecuniary obligation nor does the party complaining of the\n\nbreach become entitled to a debt due from the other party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_52\">According to the Apex Court, the only right which the party\n\naggrieved by the breach of the contract is the right to sue for\n\ndamages. The Apex Court also observed that a claim for damages\n\nfor breach of contract is, therefore, not a claim payable and the\n\npurchaser is not entitled, in the exercise of the right conferred\n\nupon it under Clause 18, to recover the amount of such claim by\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                  24</span>\n\n\nappropriating other sums due to the contractor.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_41\">Union of India v. Raman Iron\n           Foundry</a>,while construing Clause 18 of the standard\n           contract observed :</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                 &quot;It is true that the words &quot;any claim for the\n                 payment of a sum of money&quot; occurring in\n                 the opening part of clause 18 are words of\n                 great amplitude, wide enough to cover even\n                 a claim for damages, but it is a well settled\n                 rule of interpretation applicable alike to\n                 instruments as to statutes that the meaning\n                 of ordinary words is to be found not so much\n                 in strict etymological propriety of language\n                 nor even in popular use as in the subject or\n                 occasion on which they are used and the\n                 object which is intended to be attained. The\n                 context and collocation of a particular\n                 expression may show that it was not\n                 intended to be used in the sense which it\n                 ordinarily bears. Language is at best an\n                 imperfect medium of expression and a\n                 variety of meanings may often lie in a word\n                 or expression. The exact colour and shape of\n                 the meaning of any word or expression\n                 should not be ascertained by reading it in\n                 isolation, but it should be read structurally\n                 and in its context, for its meaning may vary\n                 with its contextual setting. We must\n                 therefore, read the words &quot;any claim for the\n                 payment of a sum of money&#x27; occurring in the\n                 opening part of clause 18 not in isolation but\n                 in the context of the whole clause, for the\n                 intention of the parties to be gathered not\n                 from one part of the clause or the other but\n                 from the clause taken as a whole. It is in the\n                 light of this principle of interpretation that\n                 we must determine whether the words &#x27;any\n                 claim for the payment of a sum of money&#x27;\n                 refer only to a claim for a sum due and\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                     26</span>\n\n\n                 payable which is admitted or in case of\n                 disputes, established in a Court of law or by\n                 arbitration or they also include a claim for\n                 damages which is disputed by the\n                 contractor.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">            27. The headings prefixed to a section or a group of\n           sections in some modern statutes are regarded as\n           preambles to those sections. They cannot control the\n           plain words of the statutes but they may explain\n           ambiguous words. The view is now well settled that\n           the headings or titles prefixed to a section or a\n           group of sections can be referred to in determining,\n           the meaning of doubtful expressions. It is true that\n           the Court is entitled, to look at the headings in an\n           Act of Parliament to resolve any doubt they may\n           have as to ambiguous words. The law is clear that\n           those headings cannot be used to give a different\n           effect to clear words in the section where there\n           cannot be any doubt as to the ordinary meaning of\n           the words. The golden rule is that when the words of\n           a statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, that is,\n           they are reasonably susceptible to only one meaning,\n           the Courts are bound to give effect to that meaning\n           irrespective of the consequences, duty of a judge is\n           to expound and not to legislate, is a fundamental\n           rule. If we apply the same principle to the\n           interpretation of clause 18 of the standard form of\n           contract, it would be clear that the clause\n           unequivocally contemplates a claim for the payment\n           and it is not open to the Union of India to\n           appropriate any amount due to the contractor under\n           other pending bills. It does not contemplate the\n           amount due and, therefore, the heading of this\n           clause which talks of only &#x27;Recovery of sums due&#x27;\n           will not control Clause 18. The clause in our opinion\n           gives wide powers to the Union of India to recover\n           the amount claimed by appropriating any sum then\n           due or which at any time thereafter may become due\n           to the contractor under other contracts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">            28. Clause 18 of the standard form of contract,\n           earlier was slightly differently worded and it read.\n           &#x27;whenever under this contract any sum of money is\n           recoverable from and payable by the contractor&#x27;. But\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                     27</span>\n\n\n           this formula was deliberately and advisedly altered\n           when the present standard form was introduced and\n           instead the words &#x27;whenever any claim for payment\n           of a sum of money arises&#x27; were substituted and this\n           change in phraseology indicated that in order to\n           attract the applicability of the present Cl. 18, it was\n           not necessary that there should be a sum of money\n           due and payable by the contractor to the purchaser,\n           but it was enough if there was a mere claim on the\n           part of the purchaser for payment of a sum of money\n           by the contractor irrespective of the fact whether\n           such sum of money was presently due and payable\n           or not.

This is not a statute enacted by the\n                 legislature where it can be said that if the\n                 legislature has departed from the language\n                 used by it in an earlier enactment, it would\n                 be a fair presumption to make that the\n                 alteration in the language was deliberate\n                 and it was, intended to convey a different\n                 meaning. It is a clause in a contract which\n                 we are construing and there any reference\n                 to a similar or dissimilar clause in another\n                 contract would be irrelevant.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">            29.

It may, however, be pointed\n           out that even after the change in the language of\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                   28</span>\n\n\n           Clause 18 of the standard agreement the Union of\n           India cannot be injuncted from withholding the\n           amount under other bills of the contractor.

The Union of India\n           has no objection to the giant of an injunction\n           restraining it from recovering or appropriating the\n           amount lying with it in respect of other claims of the\n           contractor towards its claim for damages. But\n           certainly Cl. 18 of the standard contract confers\n           ample power upon the Union of India to withhold\n           the amount and no injunction order could be passed\n           restraining the Union of India from withholding the\n           amount.&quot; (underline supplied)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">     13. From the above paragraphs, it is clear that the Apex\n\nCourt interpreted Clause 18 and observed that, it unequivocally\n\ncontemplates a claim for the payment and it is open to the Union\n\nof India to appropriate any amount due to the contractor under\n\nthe pending bills. That shows that the Apex Court was\n\nconsidering the 2nd point raised in Raman Iron foundry&#x27;s case\n\n(supra). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120342440\" id=\"span_61\">In paragraph No.29 of the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/120342440/\" id=\"a_43\">Kamaluddin\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019              29</span>\n\n\nAnsari</a>&#x27;s case, the Apex Court again observed that Clause 18 of\n\nthe standard agreement, the Union of India cannot be injuncted\n\nfrom withholding the amount under other bills of the contractor.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">But it is clearly stated subsequently that, the Union of India can\n\ncertainly be injuncted from recovering or appropriating it to the\n\ndamages claimed. It is also observed that an injunction order\n\nrestraining the Union of India from withholding the amount due\n\nunder other pending bills to the contractor virtually amounts to a\n\ndirection to pay the amount to the contractor-appellant. The Apex\n\nCourt observed that such an order was clearly beyond the\n\npurview of Clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/1519579/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 41</a> of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996. Clause 18 of the standard contract\n\nconfers ample power upon the Union of India to withhold the\n\namount and no injunction order could be passed restraining the\n\nUnion of India from withholding the amount. Therefore, it is clear\n\nthat the Apex Court was considering only the right of the\n\nGovernment to withhold the amount that is due to the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_63\">The principle <a href=\"/doc/120342440/\" id=\"a_45\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_46\">Raman Iron\n\nFoundry</a>&#x27;s case (supra), on this point is overruled.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120342440\" id=\"span_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_65\">But the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    30</span>\n\n\ndictum <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_47\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_48\">Raman Iron Foundry</a>&#x27;s case (supra)\n\nregarding the claim for unliquidated damages without an\n\nadjudication from a court when there is dispute from the other\n\nparty is not considered by the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/120342440/\" id=\"a_49\">Kamaluddin\n\nAnsari</a>&#x27;s case (supra).

The same is extracted hereunder :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             7.    On a consideration of the matter we find\n             ourselves unable to accept the contentions of\n             Mr.Iyenger. The terms of Clause 12 do not afford\n             scope for a liberal construction being made\n             regarding the powers of the Deputy Commissioner\n             to adjudicate upon a disputed question of breach as\n             well as to assess the damages arising from the\n             breach. The crucial words in Clause 12 are &quot;and for\n             any breach of conditions set forth herein before, the\n             first party shall be liable to pay damages to the\n             second party as may be assessed by the second\n             party.&quot; On a plain reading of the words it is clear\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                  31</span>\n\n\n           that the right of the second party to assess damages\n           would arise only if the breach of conditions is\n           admitted or if no issue is made of it. If is was the\n           intention of the parties than the officer acting on\n           behalf of the State was also entitled to adjudicate\n           upon a dispute regarding the breach of conditions\n           the wording of Clause 12 would have been entirely\n           different. It cannot also be argued that a right to\n           adjudicate upon an issue relating to a breach of\n           conditions of the contract would flow from or is\n           inhered in the right conferred to assess the damages\n           arising from a breach of conditions. The power to\n           assess damages, as pointed out by the Full Bench, is\n           a subsidiary and consequential power and not the\n           primary power. Even assuming for argument&#x27;s sake\n           that the terms of Clause 12 afford scope for being\n           construed as empowering the officer of the State to\n           decide upon the question of breach as well as assess\n           the quantum of damages, we do nor think that\n           adjudication by the officer regarding the breach of\n           the contract can be sustained under law because a\n           party to the agreement cannot be an arbiter in his\n           own cause. Interests of justice and equity require\n           that where a party to a contract disputes the\n           committing of any breach of conditions the\n           adjudication should be by an independent person or\n           body and not by the other party to the contract. The\n           position will, however, be different where there is\n           no dispute or there is consensus between the\n           contracting parties regarding the breach of\n           conditions. In such a case the officer of the State,\n           even though a party to the contract will be well\n           within his rights in assessing the damages\n           occasioned by the breach in view of the specific\n           terms of Clause 12.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           8.    We are, therefore, in agreement with the view\n           of the Full Bench that the powers of the State under\n           an agreement entered into by it with a private\n           person providing for assessment of damages for\n           breach of conditions and recovery of the damages\n           will stand confined only to those cases where the\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    32</span>\n\n\n           breach of conditions is admitted or it is not\n           disputed.&quot;(underline supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_72\">15. In the above judgment, the Apex Court laid down the\n\nprinciple that where a party to a contract dispute any breach of\n\nconditions, the adjudication should be by an independent person\n\nor body and not by other parties to the contract. That principle is\n\nin force even now. A Division Bench of this Court in Build Tech\n\nIndia Ltd. v. State of Kerala and others [2000 (2) KLJ 142]\n\nrelied on the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_54\">Shree Rameshwara\n\nRice Mills</a>&#x27; case (supra) and observed like this :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           2. We heard both sides. The pivotal question that\n           arises for consideration is as to whether the breach\n           in question is admitted by the petitioner or not. The\n           refrain of the petitioner throughout is that it is the\n           respondents 2 and 3 who have committed breach of\n           contract by refusing to pay part bill for 10% of the\n           work completed even though fund was available.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">           Even according to the second respondent, the\n           petitioner has done 20% of the work vide para.2 of\n           Ext. P1. According to the petitioner, he completed\n           about 10% of the work and submitted a bill for\n           Rs.2.2 lakhs as early as in October, 1991. But the bill\n           was not passed. Going by Exts.P2 and P3 we are of\n           opinion that breach is not admitted by the petitioner.\n           In such a situation the moot question that arises for\n           consideration is, whether it will be open for the\n           department to adjudicate upon the disputed question\n           of breach as well as to assess the damages arising\n           from the breach (in this case the damage suffered by\n           the department on account of re-arranging the work\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    33</span>\n\n\n           through other agencies). As per the records, the\n           petitioner executed the agreement on 30-1-1990 and\n           Ext. P1 order of termination at his risk and cost was\n           passed on 29-4-1992. However, re-arrangement was\n           effected only on 4-7-1995 and the demand evidenced\n           by Ext. P5 was made on 5-3-1996. On a consideration\n           of the attendant facts and circumstances brought to\n           our notice as stated above, we are of opinion that the\n           petitioner cannot be said to have admitted breach of\n           contract on his part. Even where the power of the\n           State or its instrumentality under an agreement\n           entered into by it with a private individual expressly\n           provided for assessment of damages for breach of\n           conditions of the agreement and recovery of\n           damages, that power can be exercised only in cases\n           where the breach is admitted or is not disputed. It is,\n           by now, well settled that one of the contracting\n           parties cannot adjudicate upon a disputed question\n           of breach as well as to assess the damages arising\n           from the breach. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_74\">As already noticed, the petitioner\n           has alleged in Exts.P2 and P3 and also in the original\n           petition that he has not committed breach of\n           contract and the failure to complete the work was\n           due to lapses on the part of the department in\n           honouring the bill submitted by him after completing\n           part of the work. Even assuming that clause in an\n           agreement empowers the State to adjudicate the\n           question of breach as well as the quantum of\n           damages, the adjudication by an officer of the State\n           regarding the breach of contract and assessment of\n           damage cannot be sustained in law because the\n           parties to an agreement cannot be an arbiter in his\n           own cause. The question as to whether there is a\n           breach of contract and if so, what is the question of\n           damages, are all matters which are best left to be\n           adjudicated upon by a court or a tribunal and not by\n           one of the contracting parties. The view we are\n           taking finds support in the decision of the Supreme\n           Court reported in <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_55\">State of Karnataka v. Rameshwara\n           Rice Mills Thirthahalli</a> (AIR 1987 SC 1359). There, it\n           was contended that when the State is one of the\n           contracting parties and seeks to recover damages for\n           breach of that contract, the State cannot be a Judge\n           in its own cause and cannot be its own arbiter to\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                        34</span>\n\n\n           determine the liability and quantum of damages.\n           Upholding the contention, the Apex Court held as\n           follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                         &quot;The terms of Clause.12 do not afford\n                         scope for a liberal construction being\n                         made regarding the powers of the\n                         Deputy Commissioner to adjudicate\n                         upon a disputed question of breach as\n                         well as to assess the damages arising\n                         from the breach. The crucial words in\n                         Clause.12 are and for any breach of\n                         conditions set forth hereinbefore, the\n                         first party shall be liable to pay\n                         damages to the second party as may\n                         be assessed by the second party. On a\n                         plain reading of the words, it is clear\n                         that the right of the second party to\n                         assess damages would arise only if the\n                         breach of conditions is admitted or if\n                         no issue is made of it. If it was the\n                         intention of the parties that the officer\n                         acting on behalf of the State was also\n                         entitled to adjudicate upon a dispute\n                         regarding the breach of conditions the\n                         wording in Clause.12 would have been\n                         entirely different. It cannot also be\n                         argued that a right to adjudicate upon\n                         an issue relating to a breach of\n                         conditions of the contract would flow\n                         from or is inhered in the right\n                         conferred to assess the damages\n                         arising from a breach of conditions.\n                         The power to assess damages, as\n                         pointed out by the Full Bench, is a\n                         subsidiary and consequential power\n                         and not the primary power. Even\n                         assuming for arguments sake that the\n                         terms of Clause.12 afford scope for\n                         being construed as empowering the\n                         officer of the State to decide upon the\n                         question of breach as well as assess\n                         the quantum of damages, we do not\n                         think that adjudication by the officer\n                         regarding the breach of the contract\n                         can be sustained under law because a\n                         party to the agreement cannot be an\n                         arbiter in his own cause.

In the case on hand, going by\n           the pleadings as already noticed, it cannot be held\n           that the petitioner has admitted the breach.\n           Therefore the respondents have no jurisdiction to\n           quantify the damage or loss alleged to have\n           sustained by it on account of the alleged breach.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">     16.

In cases where a constitutional right is\n           infringed, writs would ordinarily be the appropriate\n           remedy. In tender matters, such can be either when\n           a party seeks to hold the State to its duty of treating\n           all persons equally or prohibit it from acting\n           arbitrarily; or when executive actions or legislative\n           instruments     are   challenged      for   being    in\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    39</span>\n\n\n           contravention to the freedom of carrying on trade\n           and commerce. However, writs are impermissible\n           when the allegation is solely with regard to violation\n           of a contractual right or duty. Hence, the persons\n           seeking writ relief must also actively satisfy the\n           Court that the right it is seeking is one in public law,\n           and not merely contractual. In doing so, a balance is\n           maintained between the need for commercial\n           freedom and the very real possibility of collusion,\n           illegality and squandering of public resources.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">     19.

High Court of Kerala held that once a\n    breach of contract is not admitted by the apposite party, there\n    should be a full-fledged adjudication by an independent agency or\n    Tribunal before initiating coercive steps. The sum and substance of\n    the above Court Order and other judicial pronouncements in this\n    issue is that, when a dispute arises as to whether a contract has\n    been violated or not, that dispute cannot be settled by one of the\n    parties to the contract because he could not be an arbitrator in his\n    own cause. The dispute has to be referred to an arbitrator or the\n    same has to be settled in a court of law. Since there is no arbitration\n    clause in the agreements executed at present, the question of\n    referring disputes to arbitration under the agreement already\n    executed is legally impossible. Therefore, the only course available\n    for recovering the loss from the contractor is to file civil suit before\n    the subordinate courts having jurisdiction. At present Government\n    has been exempted from the payment of court fees. Therefore, there\n    will not be any difficulty in filing Civil suits in consultation with the\n    Government Pleaders concerned. The interest of Government can be\n    served by issuing instructions to the Departmental Officers for filing\n    civil suits before Court having jurisdiction, in consultation with the\n    Government Pleaders concerned, immediately on termination of\n    contract at the risk and cost of the contractor, instead of initiating\n    revenue recovery steps.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">    Government have examined the matter in detail in consultation with\n    Law Department.

The terms of clause 12 do not\n                  afford scope for a liberal construction being\n                  made regarding the powers of the Deputy\n                  Commissioner to adjudicate upon a\n                  disputed question of breach as well as to\n                  assess the damages arising from the\n                  breach. The crucial words in Cl.12 are &quot;and\n                  for any breach of conditions set forth herein\n                  before, the first party shall be liable to pay\n                  damages to the second party as may be\n                  assessed by the second party.&quot; On a plain\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                       44</span>\n\n\n                  reading of the words, it is clear that the\n                  right of the second party to assess damages\n                  would arise only if the breach of conditions\n                  is admitted or if no issue is made of it. It it\n                  was the intention of the parties that the\n                  officer acting on behalf of the State was\n                  also entitled to adjudicate upon a dispute\n                  regarding the breach of conditions the\n                  wording in clause 12 would have been\n                  entirely different. It cannot also be argued\n                  that a right to adjudicate upon an issue\n                  relating to a breach of conditions of the\n                  contract would flow from or is inhered in\n                  the right conferred to assess the damages\n                  arising from a breach of conditions. The\n                  power to assess damages, as pointed out by\n                  the Full Bench, is a subsidiary and\n                  consequential power and not the primary\n                  power. Even assuming for argument&#x27;s sake\n                  that the terms of clause 12 afford scope for\n                  being construed as empowering the officer\n                  of the Sate to decide upon the question of\n                  breach as well as assess the quantum of\n                  damages, we do not think that adjudication\n                  by the Officer regarding the breach of the\n                  contract can be sustained under law\n                  because a party to the agreement cannot be\n                  an arbiter in his own cause. Interests of\n                  justice and equity require that where a\n                  party to a contract disputes the committing\n                  of    any    breach     of  conditions,    the\n                  adjudication should be independent person\n                  or body, and not by the other party to the\n                  contract. The position will, however, be\n                  different where there is no dispute or there\n                  is consensus between the contracting\n                  parties regarding the breach of conditions.\n                  In such a case, the Officer of the State, even\n                  though a party to the contract, will be sell\n                  within his rights in assessing the damages\n                  occasioned by the breach in view of the\n                  specific terms of clause 12.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                 8. We are, therefore, in agreement with the\n                 view of the Full Bench that the powers of\n                 the State under an agreement entered into\n                 by it with a private person providing for\n                 assessment of damages for breach of\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                       45</span>\n\n\n                 conditions and recovery of the damages will\n                 stand confined only to those cases where\n                 the breach of conditions is admitted or it is\n                 not disputed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">           3.     Following the above judgment the Division Bench\n           of this Court in Build Tech. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"857240\" id=\"span_100\"><a href=\"/doc/857240/\" id=\"a_72\">India v. State of Kerala &amp; Ors.</a>\n           [2000 (2) KLJ 142] it was held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                  &quot;The question as to whether there is a\n                  breach of contract and if so, what is the\n                  question of damages, are all matters, which\n                  are best left to be adjudicated upon by a\n                  court. or a tribunal and not by one of the\n                  contracting parties. When breach is not\n                  admitted, one of the contracting parties\n                  cannot arrogate to itself the power to claim\n                  compensation for the breach from the other\n                  party without there being any adjudication\n                  by an outside agency as to whether there\n                  was any breach of contract. In the case on\n                  hand; going by the pleadings as already\n                  noticed, it cannot be held that the petitioner\n                  has admitted the breach. Therefore the\n                  respondents have no jurisdiction to quantify\n                  the damage or loss alleged to have\n                  sustained by it on account of the alleged\n                  breach.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">           It is disturbing for this Court that State is unable to\n           resort to recovery by filing Civil suit and stake legitimate\n           claim for compensation. It appears that the State has\n           found out adhoc arbitration is not feasible for many\n           reasons. However, State shall not fail to recover the loss\n           sustained by it on account of breach of contractual\n           obligation. Adhoc arbitration may not be ideal due to\n           corruption and other related factors, but nothing deters\n           from State having an institutional arbitration through a\n           State Sponsored Scheme. It is open for the State to have\n           a legislative for such a permanent arbitration court to\n           resolve the disputes like this. This Court is of the view\n           that the matter requires serious consideration, otherwise\n           State will stand to lose a substantial chunk of amount\n           being claimed as damages or compensation from the\n           contractor. Considering the importance of this issue, this\n           Court is of the view that the Advocate General or State\n           Attorney shall appear before this Court on next date of\n           posting to address this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\"> W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                   46</span>\n\n\n           Hand over.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">           Post on 30.6.2016.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">     25. Thereafter, the matter came up for consideration on\n\n27.9.2017 and on that day also, an order was passed, which is\n\nalso extracted hereunder :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           &quot;The State Attorney appeared before this Court and\n           reported that resorting to arbitration for resolving\n           the dispute between the State and the contractors is\n           not an effective remedy. In such circumstances, it is\n           appropriate for the State to have a separate court\n           for resolving the dispute between the State and the\n           contractors. The State shall seriously consider this\n           issue in the light of the fact that large number of\n           writ   petitions   are   being    filed  challenging\n           termination of the contracts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           This Court in fact interfered in many of the matters\n           relegating the State to work out their claim for loss\n           before the civil court. It is to be noted that the\n           proceedings before the civil court will take years to\n           settle down.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           In such circumstances, it is appropriate for the State\n           to have a separate court presided by an officer in the\n           rank of District Judge for trying disputes arising\n           from contracts awarded by the State. The State shall\n           also consider this option in the light of the earlier\n           order passed by this Court dated 20.06.2016.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">     26. Even then there is no action. Hence on 14.3.2018, this\n\nCourt passed the following order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\"> W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                   47</span>\n\n\n           &quot;This writ petition is pending before this Court from\n           the year 2009 onwards. It reflects a typical issue\n           related to the dispute between the contractors and\n           the State. This Court passed a series of orders\n           directing the State to explore the possibility of an\n           efficacious mechanism to settle such disputes\n           through an institutional mode. Anyhow, taking note\n           of the present dispute, this Court is of the view that\n           the State should consider thrashing out the present\n           dispute through an Arbitrator, preferably, a retired\n           Judge of this Court as the Arbitrator, chosen by the\n           Government. The State Attorney shall explore the\n           possibility of appointing such Arbitrator of their\n           own choice within a period of ten days.\n           Post on 26.3.2018.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">     27. Meanwhile, a writ petition was filed by the petitioner\n\nas W.P.(C.) No. 2337/2016 seeking a direction to the Government\n\nto consider the request to appoint a Technical Expert Arbitral\n\nTribunal for resolution of the disputes that arose out of the\n\nconstruction of the breakwaters. The Government opposed the\n\nsame. After considering the contention of both sides, this Court\n\nobserved that the Government is vested with the power to\n\nappoint an arbitrator to resolve the disputes that arise under the\n\ncontract. This Court directed to consider the representation as\n\nper judgment dated 11.7.2016 in W.P.(C.) No. 2337/2016. The\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019                    48</span>\n\n\nrelevant   paragraphs       in   the   above    judgment      is     extracted\n\nhereunder :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                  &quot;7. On an evaluation of the said provision it\n           is categoric and clear that, Government is vested\n           with power to appoint any arbitrator to resolve the\n           dispute that arises under the contract. Requesting\n           the Government to invoke the said powers,\n           petitioner    has   submitted      Exts.P8    to   P10\n           applications. Therefore, I think it is only appropriate\n           that, Government is directed to take into\n           consideration Clause 24 of Ext.P1 agreement and\n           take a decision as to whether an arbitrator is to be\n           appointed in order to resolve the dispute that arose\n           between the petitioner and the Government, as per\n           Ext.P1 agreement.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                  8. Therefore, there will be a direction to the\n           first respondent to take a decision on Exts.P8 to P10\n           applications submitted by the petitioner, in\n           accordance with law, within a period of two months\n           from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                 Writ petition is disposed of accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">     28. Even then, no steps were taken by the respondents and\n\nthe Government rejected the proposal to appoint an arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">     29. In this background, this writ petition has to be\n\nconsidered. As I observed earlier, admittedly, Ext.P7 is a\n\nproceeding issued without giving an opportunity of hearing to the\n\npetitioner. Moreover, the damages is fixed by the respondents\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019               49</span>\n\n\nunilaterally, when there is a dispute from the side of the\n\npetitioner. In Ext.P7, the damage assessed is Rs.4,34,12,105/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_105\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"461988\" id=\"span_106\">and that also, without giving an opportunity of hearing to the\n\npetitioner and it is a unilateral decision. According to me, this\n\nviolates the principle <a href=\"/doc/857240/\" id=\"a_73\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/461988/\" id=\"a_74\">Raman\n\nIron Foundry</a>&#x27;s case (<a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_75\">supra), Shree Rameshwara Rice Mills&#x27;</a>\n\ncase (supra) and also the dictum <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_76\">laid down by</a> this Court in Build\n\nTech India Ltd.&#x27;s case (supra). Moreover, it violates Ext.P13\n\ncircular issued by the Government itself. Therefore, according to\n\nme, Ext.P7 and all further proceedings consequent to Ext.P7\n\nincluding the revenue recovery is to be set aside. It is a fact that\n\nthis court was issuing directions after directions to assess the\n\ndamages if any sustained to the state by resorting to appropriate\n\nlegal proceedings and the first order was on 03.06.2010. But, it\n\nall falls on deaf ears. Now about 12 years elapsed. But this court\n\ncannot be a silent spectator to this. If really any damages are\n\nsustained to the state because of any violation of the terms of the\n\ncontract by the contractor, one more opportunity can be given to\n\nthe state to resort to the appropriate legal remedy in accordance\n W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019              50</span>\n\n\nto law, because the ultimate looser is the poor tax-paying\n\ncitizens. Therefore I make it clear that the respondents are free\n\nto approach the civil court with a prayer to assess the damage if\n\nany and if any such suit or other proceedings are initiated by the\n\nrespondents, the time during which this writ petition was\n\npending before this Court will be excluded while calculating the\n\nlimitation period. The petitioner will also get the same benefit if\n\nthey approach the civil court for getting any amount due to them\n\nfrom the respondents. As far as the prayer in W.P.(C.) No.\n\n4586/2019 is concerned, this Court cannot entertain the same,\n\nbecause there is a claim from the respondents for damages,\n\nwhich is to be assessed by a competent authority. Therefore, the\n\nprayer in W.P.(C.) No. 4856/2019 cannot be entertained. But as i\n\nstated earlier, the petitioner is also free to approach the civil\n\ncourt, if there is any legal claim due to them from the state. In\n\nsuch a situation also, the time during which this writ petition was\n\npending before this Court will be excluded while calculating the\n\nlimitation period.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\"> W.P(C) No.31363 of 2009 &amp;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">W.P(C) No.4856 of 2019              51</span>\n\n\n     Therefore, these two writ petitions are disposed of in the\n\nfollowing manner :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">  1) W.P.(C.)
