According to Meera, the said cheques included the earnest\n                  money amount of â‚¹ 12.5 crores paid by Priti to her. The cheques,\n                  being of three months&#x27; validity, expired between 10 August 2012 and\n                  30 August 2012.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">                  8.        The case of Priti, as set up before the learned Arbitrator, was\n                  that Meera failed to comply with the Compulsory Requirements\n                  before the terminus ad quem of 24 March 2012, though additional\n                  time in that regard was also granted by Priti.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">                  9.       The impugned award has substantially rejected this contention\n                  of Priti. The learned Arbitrator holds that sub-clauses (b) and (c) of\n                  Clause 3 of the ATS were in fact fulfilled by Meera and clause (a) was\n                  also partly fulfilled, to the extent of clearance of the dues of the Bank\n                  and obtaining of a No Dues Certificate. The learned Arbitrator has\n                  found Meera, however, to be remiss in her obligation under Clause 3\n                  of the ATS to the extent of the requirement of getting the original title\n                  deeds of the disputed property released from the bank.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                   Page 7 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">12:33:14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                   10.

They have,\n                  therefore, to be taken as correct. The only default, on Meera&#x27;s part, in\n                  respect of compliance with the Compulsory Requirements envisaged\n                  only in Clause 3 of the ATS was, as per the impugned award,\n                  therefore, only in failing to have the original title deeds of the disputed\n                  property released from the bank.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">                  11.      Meera&#x27;s contention, both before the learned Arbitrator and\n                  before this Court, is, however, that she had complied with the\n                  Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause 3 of the ATS, albeit\n                  belatedly.     The   delay   in   compliance    with   the   Compulsory\n                  Requirements, according to Meera, was because Priti defaulted in her\n                  obligation to submit the building plans in respect of the disputed\n                  property on or before the last week of January 2012. Meera contends,\n                  however, that, even if it were to be presumed that there was delay on\n                  her part in complying with the Compulsory Requirements envisaged\n                  by Clause 3 of the ATS, that did not extend the date of 10 April 2012,\n                  by which date Priti was required to pay the balance sale consideration\n                  to Meera.      The additional time granted by Priti to Meera to comply\n                  with the Compulsory Requirements, too, according to Meera, did not\n                  extend the said date.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">                  12.      Meera&#x27;s case, before the learned Arbitrator as well as before\n                  this Court, is that it was Priti who defaulted in her obligation to pay\n                  the balance sale consideration to Meera on or before 10 April 2012.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                    Page 8 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">12:33:14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">                   13.

On 2 June 2012, No Dues Certificate was obtained by\n                  Meera from the bank, and the requirement of the demarcation of the\n                  dispute property by erection of pillars was also fulfilled. According to\n                  Meera, with this, the Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause 3\n                  of the ATS stood met by her. At the highest, therefore, contends\n                  Meera, Priti would have had to make the balance payment of the sale\n                  consideration within 17 days (being the difference between 10 April\n                  2012 and 24 March 2012) from 2 June 2012, which also expired on 19\n                  June 2012.

According to Meera, this payment was made only\n                  because the building plans in respect of the disputed property had\n                  been sanctioned by the MCD on 11 May 2012.

On 30 January 2013, Meera again wrote to Priti, stating that she\n                 was terminating the ATS and enclosing, with the letter, a cheque for â‚¹\n                 5.4 crores.           The said cheque was admittedly encashed by Priti.\n                 Meera&#x27;s contention is that this act of encashment amounted to deemed\n                 acceptance, by Priti, of the terms of the letter dated 30 January 2013\n                 including the factum of termination of the ATS.

That both the aforesaid letters dated 28 December 2012 and 30\n                 January 2013 were in fact received by Priti, is manifest from the fact\n                 that Priti provided a consolidated response vide letter dated 26\n                 February 2013, addressed to Meera. Priti asserted, in the said reply,\n                 that Clause 5 of the ATS, which envisaged the balance sale\n                 consideration being made by Priti on or before 10 April 2012, stood\n                 novated by the default, on Meera&#x27;s part, to comply with the\n                 Compulsory Requirements stipulated in Clause 3 of the ATS on or\n                 before the cut off date of 24 March 2012. As such, she refuted\n                 Meera&#x27;s contention that she was entitled to terminate the ATS. Priti\n                 asserted that the ATS continued to remain valid and subsisting and\n                 called upon Meera to comply with her obligations thereunder. She\n                 also asserted, therefore, that Meera had no right to forfeit the earnest\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n                  3 (2006) 5 SCC 311\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                   Page 14 of 96</span>\nSigning Date:05.12.2023\n12:33:14\n                   money of â‚¹ 5.4 crores paid by Priti.

As none of the communications elicited any response from\n                  Meera, Priti addressed a notice, under Section 214 of the 1996 Act, to\n                  Meera on 28 January 2016, purporting to invoke arbitration in terms\n                  of Clause 23 of the ATS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_43\">                  24.

This denial constitutes a main bone of contention between\n                  Meera and Priti. Meera&#x27;s contention is that the original notice dated\n                  28 January 2016, and the postal receipt evidencing service of the said\n                  notice on Meera, never saw the light of day and that Priti only filed a\n                  certified copy of the said notice before the learned Arbitrator after\n                  conclusion of arguments. She further contends that, as the notice dated\n                  28 January 2016 is not a public document, no presumption of validity\n                  attaches to it under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_11\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> and that, therefore,\n                  Priti had necessarily to prove the document by moving an application\n                  to lead secondary evidence. Meera relies, for this proposition, on the\n                  judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/993476/\" id=\"a_12\">Dr. Gurmukh Ram Madan v.\n                  Bhagwan Ram Madan5</a>.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">                  4 21.

Re. limitation\n\n\n                  39.1 In this context, the learned Arbitrator first addressed the\n                  submission of Meera that she had not received the notice dated 28\n                  January 2016 issued by Priti under <a href=\"/doc/138599/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 21</a> of the 1996 Act. She\n                  observed that the said notice was a document which found mention in\n                  all pleadings filed by Priti since inception. It also found mention in\n                  OMP (I) 28/2016 filed by Priti under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 9</a> and Arb.

She also noted that,\n                  admittedly, the notice dated 28 January 2016, as well as the postal\n                  receipt evidencing service of the said notice on Meera had been\n                  annexed with OMP (I) 28/2016 and Arb. Pet. 585/2016.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_69\">                  39.2 The postal receipt, notes the learned Arbitrator, showed that the\n                  notice dated 28 January 2016 had, in fact, been received by Meera,\n                  whose name was mentioned on the Registered AD cover. She also\n                  notes that the tracking number and the name of the respondent as it\n                  figured on the receipt column tallied. The address reflected on the\n                  registered AD cover was admittedly the address of Meera, where she\n                  was residing even at that stage.                             As such, there was a legal\n                  presumption, under <a href=\"/doc/473654/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 114(g)</a><a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_23\">10</a> of the Evidence Act, about\n\n                  10 This appears to be a wrong reference.

Meera, even while denying receipt of the\n                  notice, did not dispute the fact that the original postal receipt was filed\n                  with Arbitration Petition. Submission to that effect was only made\n                  belatedly at the stage of final arguments before the learned Arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">                  39.4 The learned Arbitrator also relied on the order dated 15 March\n                  2019 of this Court in Crl. M.C. 1718/2017, which recorded Meera&#x27;s\n                  statement that the parties had invoked arbitration, which was pending.\n                  The only notice invoking arbitration was the letter dated 28 January\n                  2016.      Having admitted that arbitration had been invoked, Meera\n                  could not now seek to contend that she had not received the notice\n                  dated 28 January 2016.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">                  39.5 In view of all these facts, the learned Arbitrator held that the\n                  fact of issuance of notice dated 28 January 2016 by Priti, and receipt\n                  thereof by Meera on 30 January 2016 stood duly proved.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">                  39.6 The learned Arbitrator also found the submission of Meera that\n                  the ATS was terminated on 15 January 2013 to be incorrect. She\n                  noted that the termination notice was dated 30 January 2013, which\n\n\n                           But the Court shall also have regard to such facts as the following, in considering whether such\n                           maxims do or do not apply to the particular case before it--\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">                                                                      *****\n                                    as to illustration (f) -the question is whether a letter was received.

The notice dated 30 January 2013\n                  unequivocally stated that the ATS was &quot;hereby terminated with\n                  immediate effect&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_77\">                  39.7 Inasmuch as arbitration was invoked on 28 January 2016, which\n                  was within a period of 3 years reckoned from 30 January 2016, the\n                  learned Arbitrator found that the invocation of arbitration was within\n                  limitation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">                  39.8 She also noted, in this context, that the cause of action for both\n                  the claims in the claim petition i.e. for the claim or â‚¹ 12.5 crores and\n                  25.5 crores arose only after termination of the ATS. Similarly, there\n                  was no question of claiming pre-suit interest at any earlier point of\n                  time. As such, all claims filed by Priti were found to be within\n                  limitation. The plea of limitation, urged by Meera was, therefore,\n                  rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">                  40.      On merits\n\n\n                 40.1 On merits, the learned Arbitrator holds that Clause 5 of the\n                  ATS was clear and categorical in requiring payment of the balance\n                  sale consideration to be made by Priti on or before 10 April 2012 only\n                  subject to compliance, by Meera, with the Compulsory Requirements\n                  envisaged in Clause 3 on or before 24 March 2012. There were three\n                  Compulsory Requirements, envisaged in sub-clauses (a) to (c) of\n                  Clause 3 of the ATS. The Compulsory Requirements envisaged in\n                  sub-clauses (b) and (c) of Clause 3 had been fulfilled by Meera.\n                  Insofar as the Compulsory Requirements in sub-clause (a) of Clause 3\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                  Page 23 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">12:33:14</span>\n                   were concerned, though Meera had obtained a No Dues Certificate\n                  from the Bank, there was no evidence either oral or documentary,\n                  indicating that the original title deeds of the property had been\n                  collected by Meera from the Bank at any point of time. The\n                  requirement of obtaining the original title deeds of the disputed\n                  property from the Bank was not an empty formality, but was\n                  necessary in view of Clauses 9 and 11 of the ATS, of which Clause 9\n                  proscribed Meera, pending completion of sale of the disputed\n                  property, to enter into any agreement qua the said property with any\n                  third party and Clause 11 required the original documents in respect of\n                  the disputed property to be retained by Meera, pending completion of\n                  sale of the disputed property, with Priti having the right to inspect and\n                  peruse the documents. The letter dated 2 June 2012 from the Bank to\n                  Meera clearly stated that the original title deeds of the disputed\n                  property were still with the Bank, and advised Meera to have them\n                  collected. There was no evidence to indicate that Meera heeded this\n                  advice and had the original title deeds collected from the Bank. The\n                  learned Arbitrator also holds that, even before her, Meera was unable\n                  to produce the original title deeds.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">                 40.2 As such, the Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause\n                  3(a) of the ATS were not fulfilled by Meera to the extent they required\n                  her to collect the original title deeds of the disputed property from the\n                  Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">                 40.3 In view of non compliance, by Meera, with the Compulsory\n                  Requirements envisaged in Clause 3 of the ATS by 24 March 2012,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                   Page 24 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">12:33:14</span>\n                  Priti could not be compelled to pay the balance sale consideration on\n                 or before 10 April 2012. The learned Arbitrator also relied, in this\n                 context, on a suggestion put to Priti, deposing as CW-1, by Meera,\n                 that Priti was willing to comply with her obligations under the ATS\n                 upto the end of January 2013. This clearly indicated that time was no\n                 longer of the essence of the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">                 40.4 The aforesaid circumstances also indicated that Clause 5 of the\n                 Agreement stood novated/altered by the conduct of the parties. The\n                 learned Arbitrator relies, in this context, on the judgment of the\n                 Supreme Court in Nathu Lal v. Phool Chand11, which holds that,\n                 where obligations under a contract are to be performed in a particular\n                 sequence, the obligation to perform a later act in that sequence would\n                 arise only after the earlier act was performed. Meera having defaulted\n                 in complying with the Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause\n                 3(a) before 24 March 2012, the requirement of Priti having to comply\n                 with the obligation to pay the balance payment on or before 10 April\n                 2012 never arose.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">                 40.5 In that view of the matter, the learned Arbitrator holds that\n                 Meera could not have forfeited the EMD of â‚¹ 12.5 crores made by\n                 Priti, as Clause 5 of the ATS permitted forfeiture of the earnest money\n                 only when, in the first instance, there was compliance, by Meera, with\n                 the Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause 3, within the time\n                 stipulated therein.   The amount of â‚¹ 12.5 crores was, therefore,\n                 required to be refunded to Priti. As time was no longer of the essence\n\n\n                  11 AIR 1970 SC 523\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                Page 25 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">12:33:14</span>\n                  of the contract, and the obligation of Priti to pay the balance sale\n                 consideration in accordance with Clause 5 of the ATS had not arisen,\n                 it could not be said that Priti was in default of the requirement of\n                 making payment of the balance sale consideration on or before 10\n                 April 2012.            There was nothing to indicate that the said amount\n                 included the EMD of â‚¹ 12.5 crores initially paid by Priti. As there\n                 was default, on the part of Meera, in complying with the Compulsory\n                 Requirements envisaged in Clause 3 of the ATS within the time\n                 stipulated in that regard, Priti was entitled to encash the cheques for â‚¹\n                 25.5 crores paid towards damages and injury in accordance with the\n                 agreement between the parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">                 Rival Submissions before this Court\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_85\">                 41.

Without entering the factual thicket <a href=\"/doc/153664247/\" id=\"a_28\">in that case</a>, suffice it to\n                 note that, in IOCL, a learned Single Judge of the High Court of\n                 Bombay, in a challenge to an arbitral award under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 34</a> of the\n                 1996 Act, preferred not to interfere, opining that there were two\n                 possible views regarding the correct construction to be placed on the\n                 contractual covenants, and that the Arbitral Tribunal had adopted one\n                 of them, which was a reasonable interpretation. The Division Bench,\n                 however, reversed the decision of the learned Single Judge and\n                 reinterpreted Clause 5.1.2 of the contract, holding that the said clause\n                 also included indirect taxes such as service tax, GST, Works Contract\n                 Tax, etc. In doing so, the Division Bench applied the ejusdem generis\n                 principle. Proceeding therefrom, the Division Bench held that the\n                 Arbitral Tribunal, and the learned Single Judge, had erroneously\n                 assumed that the tax liability of the items forming part of the Bill of\n                 Quantities was &quot;inbuilt&quot; in the quoted costs and that no evidence was\n                 supplied to substantiate the conclusion.

The principle of interpretation of contracts adopted by the\n                           Division Bench of the High Court that when two constructions are\n                           possible, then courts must prefer the one which gives effect and\n                           voice to all clauses, does not have absolute application. The said\n                           interpretation is subject to the jurisdiction which a court is called\n                           upon to exercise. While exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1525862/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 37</a> of\n                           the Act, the Court is concerned about the jurisdiction that the\n                           <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 34</a> Court exercised while considering the challenge to the\n                           arbitral award. The jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 34</a> of the Act is\n                           exercised only to see if the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s view is perverse or\n                           manifestly arbitrary. Accordingly, the question of reinterpreting\n                           the contract on an alternative view does not arise. If this is the\n                           principle applicable to exercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 34</a> of\n                           the Act, a Division Bench exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1525862/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 37</a>\n                           of the Act cannot reverse an award, much less the decision of a\n                           Single Judge, on the ground that they have not given effect and\n                           voice to all clauses of the contract. This is where the Division\n                           Bench of the High Court committed an error, in re-interpreting a\n                           contractual clause while exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1525862/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 37</a> of\n                           the Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"180317\" id=\"span_135\">In any event, the decision in <a href=\"/doc/180317/\" id=\"a_53\">Radha Sundar\n                           Dutta v.

Similarly, in Patel Engg., the arbitral award\n                           was found to be based on irrelevant facts and the outcome was\n                           found to result in unjust enrichment, the latter being in violation of\n                           public policy of India under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 34(2)</a> of the Act.

In Associate Builders, this Court held that an award\n                           ignoring the terms of a contract would not be in public interest.

Furthermore,\n                           in Associate Builders the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to\n                           adjudicate a dispute itself was not in issue. The Court was dealing\n                           with the circumstances in which a court could look into the merits\n                           of an award.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">                           47.    In this case, as observed above, the impugned award\n                           insofar as it pertains to lease rent and lease period is patently\n                           beyond the scope of the competence of the arbitrator appointed in\n                           terms of the dealership agreement by the Director (Marketing) of\n                           the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">                           48.     The lease agreement which was in force for a period of 29\n                           years with effect from 15-4-2005 specifically provided for monthly\n                           lease rent of Rs 1750 per month for the said plot of land on which\n                           the retail outlet had been set up. It is well settled that an Arbitral\n                           Tribunal, or for that matter, the Court cannot alter the terms and\n                           conditions of a valid contract executed between the parties with\n                           their eyes open.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">                           49.

However, when it comes to the public policy of\n                                  India, argument based upon &quot;most basic notions of justice&quot;,\n                                  it is clear that this ground can be attracted only in very\n                                  exceptional circumstances when the conscience of the\n                                  Court is shocked by infraction of fundamental notions or\n                                  principles of justice. It can be seen that the formula that\n                                  was applied by the agreement continued to be applied till\n                                  February 2013 -- in short, it is not correct to say that the\n                                  formula under the agreement could not be applied in view\n                                  of the Ministry&#x27;s change in the base indices from 1993-\n                                  1994 to 2004-2005. Further, in order to apply a linking\n                                  factor, a circular, unilaterally issued by one party, cannot\n                                  possibly bind the other party to the agreement without that\n                                  other party&#x27;s consent. Indeed, the circular itself expressly\n                                  stipulates that it cannot apply unless the contractors furnish\n                                  an undertaking/affidavit that the price adjustment under the\n                                  circular is acceptable to them. We have seen how the\n                                  appellant gave such undertaking only conditionally and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">Signature Not Verified            without prejudice to its argument that the Circular does not</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                               Page 34 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">12:33:14</span>\n                                     and cannot apply. This being the case, it is clear that the\n                                    majority award has created a new contract for the parties by\n                                    applying the said unilateral circular and by substituting a\n                                    workable formula under the agreement by another formula\n                                    dehors the agreement. This being the case, a fundamental\n                                    principle of justice has been breached, namely, that a\n                                    unilateral addition or alteration of a contract can never be\n                                    foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party to the\n                                    agreement be liable to perform a bargain not entered into\n                                    with the other party. Clearly, such a course of conduct\n                                    would be contrary to fundamental principles of justice as\n                                    followed in this country, and shocks the conscience of this\n                                    Court.

In our view, re-\n                                    writing a contract for the parties would be breach of\n                                    fundamental principles of justice entitling a court to\n                                    interfere since such case would be one which shocks the\n                                    conscience of the Court and as such, would fall in the\n                                    exceptional category.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">                           51.

The scope of interference would be limited to\n                                 grounds provided under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_139\">                                 The interference would be so warranted when the award is\n                                 in violation of &quot;public policy of India&quot;, which has been\n                                 held to mean &quot;the fundamental policy of Indian law&quot;. A\n                                 judicial intervention on account of interfering on the merits\n                                 of the award would not be permissible. However, the\n                                 principles of natural justice as contained in <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 18</a> and\n                                 <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_112\">34(2)(a)(iii)</a> of the Arbitration Act would continue to be the\n                                 grounds of challenge of an award. The ground for\n                                 interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with\n                                 justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict\n                                 with the &quot;most basic notions of morality or justice&quot;. It is\n                                 only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the\n                                 court, that can be set aside on the said ground. An award\n                                 would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality\n                                 appearing on the face of the award and as such, which goes\n                                 to the roots of the matter. However, an illegality with\n                                 regard to a mere erroneous application of law would not be\n                                 a ground for interference. Equally, reappreciation of\n                                 evidence would not be permissible on the ground of patent\n                                 illegality appearing on the face of the award.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">                                 44.

For the purposes\n                 of the dispute at hand, suffice it to state that, while interference with\n                 arbitral awards, under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 34</a>, is not proscribed, circumspection\n\n                 39 (2006) 10 SCC 763\n                 40 (1994) 2 SCC 70\n                 41 (2020) 13 SCC 564\n                 42 (2021) 7 SCC 704\n                  43 (2021) 9 SCC 449\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n                  44 (2022) 4 SCC 657\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                                 Page 43 of 96</span>\nSigning Date:05.12.2023\n12:33:14\n                   has to constitute the guiding principle. The Court does not sit in\n                  appeal over the arbitral award. Errors committed by the arbitrator,\n                  whether of fact or of law, are ordinarily impervious to interference.\n                  The arbitrator is the final arbiter of the facts, and the law. Equally, the\n                  arbitrator is free to follow her, or his, own procedure in administering\n                  the arbitration. Strict rules of evidence do not apply, although basic\n                  principles cannot be jettisoned. The relevance and materiality of the\n                  evidence is also a matter over which the arbitrator exercises\n                  discretionary dominion.     There is a complete proscription on the\n                  <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 34</a> court re-examining or revisiting the evidence, and holding,\n                  on that basis, that the evidence points to a conclusion other than that at\n                  which the arbitrator has arrived, so long as the decision of the\n                  arbitrator does not suffer from patent illegality or perversity. The\n                  Court must also be chary of broadening the scope of the expression\n                  &quot;patent illegality&quot; and drawing, within it, mere illegality. The word\n                  &quot;patent&quot; has to be accorded its due importance. It is only, therefore,\n                  where the findings of the arbitrator shock the conscience of the Court,\n                  or are so contrary to the facts and law that no person legally informed\n                  would arrive at such findings, that the Court would interfere with the\n                  award.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">                  48.

Mr. Mata submits that the terminus a quo, for\n                   commencement of limitation could, without prejudice to each other,\n                   be 24 March 2012, May 2012, 29 September 2012, 24 December 2012\n                   or 15 January 2013.                    Reckoned from any of the said dates, the\n                   institution of arbitration by Priti - assuming receipt of the notice dated\n                   28 January 2016 by Meera - was beyond time. He justifies the\n                   computation of the starting point for limitation as one or other of the\n                   aforenoted dates on the following reasoning:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">                             (i)       Admittedly, the ATS required Meera to fulfil the\n                             Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause 3 on or before\n                             24 March 2012. Priti&#x27;s allegation, and the very basis of her\n                             claim, was that Meera defaulted in doing so. Under Article 2745\n                             of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_123\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>, the starting point for limitation for\n                             institution of arbitration would be 24 March 2012.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">                             (ii)      Alternatively, Mr. Mata relies on para 3(viii) of the SOC\n                             and the cross examination of CW-2, Rohit Saraf on 19 August\n                             2019 to contend that, in terms of Article 5546 read with Article\n                             5447 of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_124\">Limitation Act</a>, the starting point for limitation, for\n                             Priti, would be May 2012.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">                   45 <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 27</a> requires any suit for &quot;compensation for breach of a promise to do anything at a specified time, or\n\n                  upon the happening of a specified contingency&quot; to be instituted within 3 years of the date &quot;when the time\n                  specified arrives or the contingency happens&quot;.\n                  46 <a href=\"/doc/1164414/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 55</a> provides that the period of limitation for institution of proceedings &quot;for compensation for the\n\n                  breach of any contract, express or implied, not herein specially provided for&quot; would be 3 years from the date\n                  &quot;when the contract is broken or (where there are successive breaches) when the breach in respect of which the\n                  suit is instituted occurs or (where the breach is continuing) when it ceases&quot;.\n                  47 <a href=\"/doc/887242/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 54</a> provides that the suit &quot;for specific performance of a contract&quot; has to be instituted within 3 years\n\n                  of &quot;The date fixed for the performance, or, if no such date is fixed, when the plaintiff has notice that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n                  performance is refused.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                                                     Page 45 of 96</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\">Signing Date:05.12.2023\n12:33:14\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_153\">                            (iii)    Alternatively, Mr. Mata contends that the period of 3\n                           years, envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/1164414/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 55</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_129\">Limitation Act</a>, could be\n                           reckoned from 29 September 2012, when the last of the 11\n                           PDCs tendered by Meera to Priti expired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_154\">                           (iv)     Alternatively, Mr. Mata submits, relying on the cross-\n                           examination of Priti, deposing as CW-1, that she had lost\n                           confidence, having been cheated by Meera on 24 December\n                           2012, when Meera communicated, to Priti, her intention to\n                           cancel the ATS, that the period of three years, for the purposes\n                           of <a href=\"/doc/1164414/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 55</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_131\">Limitation Act</a>, could be reckoned from 24\n                           December 2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">                           (v)      Alternatively, Mr. Mata submits, relying on the contents\n                           of the letter dated 28 December 2012 addressed by Meera to\n                           Priti, that it was made clear, in the said communication, that\n                           failure, on Priti&#x27;s part, to pay the balance sale consideration\n                           would result in ipso facto termination of the said agreement on\n                           the expiry of fifteen days of receipt of the letter by Priti.

Mr. Sethi submits, relying on the\n                  words used in the communication dated 30 January 2013 from Meera\n                  to Priti, the affidavit dated 16 September 2019 filed by way of\n                  examination-in-chief by RW-1, S. C. Goyal, and the order dated 15\n                  March 2019, passed by this Court in CRL. M.

Mr. Sethi, therefore, emphatically refutes the\n                  contention of Mr. Mata that the ATS stood terminated on any date\n                  prior to 30 January 2013.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">                  50.

He submits that Priti had failed to prove, in\n                  the arbitral proceedings, that the said notice had been delivered to\n                  Meera. Meera, for her part, specifically denied receipt of any such\n                  letter, in her reply to Arb. Pet. 585/2016.

Liberty had\n                  been reserved with the learned Arbitrator to decide whether the\n                  invocation of arbitration was within time and whether Priti&#x27;s claims\n                  themselves were barred by limitation. In that view of the matter, the\n                  question of service of the notice dated 28 January 2016 on Meera had\n                  to be strictly decided on the basis of the principles contained in the\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_138\">Evidence Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_160\">                  50.2 It is sought to be pointed out that Priti had neither filed the\n                  notice dated 28 January 2016, nor any proof of delivery thereof with\n                  its SOC and that no evidence in that regard was led during trial.\n                  Certain documents were sought to be introduced in the arbitral\n                  proceedings after conclusion of arguments, by way of an application\n                  under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 151</a> of the CPC.

M. C. 1718/2017. He submits that the\n                  said reliance constitutes &quot;patent illegality&quot;, within the meaning of\n                  <a href=\"/doc/147188107/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 34 (2A)</a> of the 1996 Act.

There was no discussion, in the judgment dated 15\n                  March 2019, on the fact of whether, in fact, the notice dated 28\n                  January 2016 had been served on Meera. In any event, he submits\n                  that the judgment dated 15 March 2019 itself directed that the\n                  observations contained in <a href=\"/doc/63713839/\" id=\"a_141\">the said judgment</a> on merits would not\n                  influence the arbitral proceedings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_166\">                  50.5 Mr. Mata further faults the learned Arbitrator in her finding\n                  that, as Meera did not state, in her reply to Arb. Pet. 585/2016, that the\n                  original of the notice dated 28 January 2016 and the postal receipts\n                  thereof were not on record, they were not proved. This finding,\n                  submits Mr. Mata, is perverse, especially as the documents filed with\n                  Arb. Pet. 585/2016 was specifically stamped &quot;true copy&quot;.

Apart from the notice dated 28 January 2016, Mr.\n                  Sethi submits that there is no document which invokes the arbitral\n                  proceedings. If, therefore, the learned Arbitrator relied on the said\n                  order to hold that the invocation of the arbitral proceedings stood\n                  admitted by Meera, no error, in the said finding, could be said to exist.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">                  51.

This\n                  stand was reflected in the notice dated 28 January 2016, whereby\n                  arbitrations were invoked as well as in the SOC filed by Priti before\n                  the learned Arbitrator. It was also specifically urged in the affidavit in\n                  evidence filed by Priti in the arbitral proceedings. Rather, submits Mr.\n                  Sethi, Meera herself, in her statement of defence, had asserted to\n                  having had the building plans sanctioned on 11 May 2012, as well as\n                  having dues of the Bank cleared and obtaining No Dues Certificate on\n                  2 June 2012 and having the property demarcated by erection of pillars\n                  also on 2 June 2012. There was no assertion regarding obtaining the\n                  title deeds from the Bank. Suresh Chand Goyal, Meera&#x27;s husband,\n                  too, in his affidavit in evidence as RW-1 did not depose, anywhere,\n                  that the title deeds of the disputed property had been obtained from the\n                  Bank.

It finds mention\n                           in the <a href=\"/doc/1589358/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 9</a> petition and the <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 11</a> petition and thereafter\n                           in the claim petition filed by the claimant.

The document dated 28.1.2016 is a crucial document. It is\n                           this document which would decide the question of limitation. The\n                           case of the claimant is that he had sent this notice on 28.1.2016. It\n                           is a settled position of law that a legal notice invoking arbitration is\n                           the date of the commencement of arbitration. A perusal of this\n                           notice dated 28.1.2016 (certified copy of the record filed by the\n                           claimant as annexures under <a href=\"/doc/1589358/\" id=\"a_168\">section 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_169\">section 11</a> petitions\n                           before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court) shows that the claimant had sent\n                           this notice on 28.1.2016 to the respondent. The postal receipt\n                           shows that this notice had been received by the respondent namely\n                           Meera Goyal whose name finds the mention in the Registered AD\n                           cover. The submission of the respondent that the complete address\n                           of the respondent not having been mentioned therein for which\n                           reason this document has no authenticity is a mistaken argument.\n                           The name of the respondent clearly finds mention in the receipt\n                           column and the tracking number is also the same. It was sent at the\n                           last known address of the respondent which is admittedly the place\n                           where the respondent resides even today. It also finds mention in\n                           all pleadings of the claimant including his petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1589358/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 9</a>\n                           and <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 11</a>) The presumption as contained under <a href=\"/doc/473654/\" id=\"a_172\">section\n                           114(g)</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, clearly lies in favour of the\n                           claimant that this document having been sent by Registered AD\n                           post at the correct address of the respondent was duly received by\n                           the respondent. That apart in the <a href=\"/doc/1067003/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 11</a> petition (Arbitration\n                           Petition 585/2016) in para 6 the claimant had clearly stated that\n                           alongwith this notice the original postal receipt has been attached.\n                           While denying the receipt of the notice the respondent had\n                           nowhere ever questioned the fact that the original postal receipt has\n                           not been filed. This submission has been made only at the stage of\n                           final arguments. Further in the order of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court\n                           dated 15.3.2019 (Crl. M.C 1718/2017 and Cr. M.A. 7009/2017)\n                           (internal page 4) it was the statement of the respondent herself that\n                           the parties had invoked arbitration which is pending. The\n                           arbitration had been invoked upon this notice dated 28.1.2016. It\n                           does not now lie in the mouth of the respondent to deny this\n                           document. The presumption raised under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_174\">Indian Evidence Act</a>\n                           is in addition to what has been discussed supra.

It can only be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                            Page 64 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">12:33:14</span>\n                   made by a notice issued under the said provision. Significantly, the\n                  statement of learned Senior Counsel before this Court was not even\n                  that Priti had invoked arbitration proceedings, but that the parties had\n                  invoked arbitration proceedings under the Agreement to Sell.\n                  Invocation of arbitration ad idem, was, therefore, conceded by learned\n                  Senior Counsel for Meera before this Court, while advancing\n                  arguments in Crl. M. C. 1718/2017 as recorded in the order dated 15\n                  March 2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">                  55.6 There is really no escape, for Meera, from this concession made\n                  before this Court. Meera seeks to contend, now, through Mr. Mata,\n                  that the concession did not amount to an admission of service of the\n                  notice dated 28 January 2016. It is also sought to be contended that\n                  the statement was made only because of the pendency of Arb. Pet.\n                  585/2016. Neither contention, in my view, can be accepted. What has\n                  been conceded before this Court is the invocation of the arbitration\n                  clause in the Agreement to Sell.       The arbitration clause in the\n                  Agreement to Sell envisages mutual appointment of an Arbitrator\n                  within 30 days of occurrence of the dispute, failing which the\n                  Arbitrator would be appointed by this Court. The submissions that\n                  arbitral proceedings had been invoked as envisaged in the Agreement\n                  to sell amounts, therefore, to a candid acknowledgement of the fact\n                  that, in fact, Priti had issued the notice dated 28 January 2016. Sans\n                  such a notice, there could be no question of invocation of arbitration\n                  in terms of the ATS.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_231\">                  55.7 That apart, I am exercising <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 34</a> jurisdiction. If the\n                  learned Arbitrator has relied on the statement of Meera&#x27;s Counsel as\n                  recorded in the order dated 15 March 2019, as acknowledging the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                  Page 65 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">12:33:14</span>\n                   invocation of arbitration which would, inter alia, amount to\n                  acknowledgement of the notice dated 28 January 2016 having been\n                  issued by Priti to Meera, it would be completely outside the limited\n                  purview of my jurisdiction to revisit the said finding on facts and\n                  arrive at a different conclusion. The statement made by learned Senior\n                  Counsel for Meera before this Court, as recorded in the order dated 15\n                  March 2019, is not hedged in by any caveat. It has, therefore, to be\n                  taken at face value.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">                  55.8 The reliance, by Mr. Mata, on the concluding observation, in\n                  the order dated 15 March 2019, that observations contained in the said\n                  order would not be construed to be an expression on merits in the\n                  arbitral proceedings, has merely to be urged to be rejected. In relying\n                  on the statement made by learned Senior Counsel for Meera, with\n                  respect to the aspect of service of the letter dated 28 January 2016 by\n                  Priti on her, it can hardly be said that the learned Arbitrator was\n                  construing any finding in the order dated 15 March 2019 as an\n                  expression of merits in the arbitral proceedings.       The concluding\n                  caveat, in the order dated 15 March 2019, can also, therefore, not be\n                  used by Mr. Mata as a ground to question the validity of the findings\n                  of the learned Arbitrator in that regard.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">                  55.9 Also of importance, in this regard, is the order dated 4\n                  November 2016 passed by this Court in Arb. Pet. 585/2016, whereby\n                  Mukul Mudgal J. was appointed as the sole arbitrator to arbitrate on\n                  the dispute between the parties.

Although the Respondent denies having\n                           received the legal demand notice dated 28th January 2016 issued by\n                           the Petitioner, a copy of the postal receipt for dispatch of said\n                           notice has been placed on record.

The\n                 tenor of the sentence &quot;although the respondent denies having received\n                 the legal demand notice dated 28 January 2016 issued by the\n                 Petitioner, a copy of the postal receipt for dispatch of the said notice\n                 has been placed on record&quot; indicates, at the very least, that this Court\n                 found the placing of record of the copy of the postal receipt for\n                 dispatch of the said notice as evidencing receipt of the notice by\n                 Meera. What was left open for consideration by the learned Arbitrator\n                 was not, strictly speaking, the correctness of the factum of the receipt\n                 of the notice, but only whether the invocation was within time and\n                 whether the claim itself was barred by limitation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">                 55.10 Even if it were to be presumed that the fact of receipt of the\n                 notice dated 28 January 2016 was open for consideration and decision\n                 by the learned Arbitrator, the afore-extracted sentence &quot;Although the\n                 Respondent denies having received the legal demand notice dated 28\n                 January 2016 issued by the Petitioner, a copy of the postal receipt for\n                  dispatch of the said notice has been placed on record&quot; clearly indicates\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                             Page 67 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">12:33:14</span>\n                   that it is not open to Meera, at this stage, to contest the issue of\n                  delivery and receipt of the notice dated 28 January 2016 on the ground\n                  that what had been placed on record was only a copy of the postal\n                  receipt.       The copy of the postal receipt has been accorded due\n                  importance by this Court in its order dated 4 November 2016, while\n                  referring the dispute to arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">                  55.11 As to whether the copy of the postal receipt of the notice dated\n                  28 January 2016, as placed on record, evidenced, or did not evidence\n                  its receipt by Meera, may have been open to debate. Even if it was, I\n                  do not find, on a consideration of the findings of the learned Arbitrator\n                  in that regard, that they suffer either from perversity or patent\n                  illegality, as to justify interference by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 34</a> of\n                  the 1996 Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_237\">                  55.12 The learned Arbitrator has clearly found that Meera&#x27;s name\n                  found mention on the Registered AD cover. Meera&#x27;s name also found\n                  name mentioned in the receipt column and the tracking number also\n                  tallied. The correctness of these findings has not been contested by\n                  Meera. The learned Arbitrator has further noted that, as the document\n                  was sent by registered post, the presumption of its receipt by Meera\n                  would be available under <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act.\n                  Illustration (f) below <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 114</a> specifically allows the Court to\n                  presume that the common course of business has been followed in\n                  particular cases. The illustration goes on, however, to require the\n                  Court to, while applying Illustration (f) to the issue of whether a letter\n                  was received, take into account interruption of the usual course of post\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_324\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                   Page 68 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">12:33:14</span>\n                   by disturbances.

That\n                  being so, the learned Arbitrator cannot be faulted, either on facts or in\n                  law, in relying on the dispatch, by Priti, of the notice dated 28 January\n                  2016 by Registered AD post to Meera as evidence of service of the\n                  said notice on Meera.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_238\">                  55.13 Much has been sought to be made, by Mr. Mata, of the fact that\n                  the original postal receipt had not been filed before the Court or before\n                  the learned Arbitrator.

Attention has been drawn to the aforenoted documents it is\n                           pointed out that these documents bear the stamp of the High Court\n                           under <a href=\"/doc/1350009/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 70</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and thus not being\n                           public documents, the question of a presumption being raised\n                           would not arise.

It is admittedly\n                           pointed out that the parties have been in litigation since the year\n                           2016 and it was way back on 23.5.2017 that the erstwhile\n                           Arbitrator has noted that the pleadings would constitute the issues.\n                           The documents now purported to be brought on record are being\n                           filed hugely belatedly. Reliance have been placed upon certain\n                           judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n                           Court, a judgment of Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Gujarat as also the\n                           Delhi High Court Rules. The latter have been relied upon to drawn\n                           distinction between a private document, a public document and an\n                           attested document.

The Claimant had concluded her final arguments when\n                           the present application was filed. The bone of contention in this\n                           application boils down largely to one document i.e. the notice\n                           purported to have been issued by the Claimant to the Respondent\n                           on 28.01.2016 and its receipts thereof. The other documents are the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_334\">Signature Not Verified     five annexures appended along with the petition under <a href=\"/doc/1067003/\" id=\"a_196\">Section 11</a></span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_335\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_336\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                             Page 70 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_337\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">12:33:14</span>\n                            and <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 9</a> of the said Act.

Thus, it is only the\n                           notice dated 28.01.2016 and its receipt thereof which appears to be\n                           the reason for vehemently opposing the present application. The\n                           undersigned notes that it is not the case of the Respondent that all\n                           the aforenoted six annexures did not form a part of <a href=\"/doc/1067003/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 11</a> and\n                           <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 9</a> petitions.

It\n                  was pointed out, by Priti, that all these documents formed subject\n                  matter of the proceedings in Arb. Pet. 585/2016 and OMP (I) No.\n                  28/2016.       It was not, therefore, as though Priti was seeking to\n                  introduce a new document in the proceedings, which Meera had no\n                  opportunity to refute. The learned Arbitrator noted that, of the six\n                  documents that were sought to be placed on record by Priti, receipt of\n                  five of the documents was admitted by Meera. The only document, of\n                  which the receipt formed subject matter of contest, was the notice\n                  dated 28 January 2016. The learned Arbitrator notes, in her order\n                  dated 4 February 2020, that it was not Meera&#x27;s case that these six\n                  annexures did not form part of Arb Pet 585/2016 or OMP (I) No.\n                  28/2016. The objection was, rather, that the documents were only\n                  copies of copies and not certified copies. In this regard, the learned\n                  Arbitrator has placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1166210/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 19</a> of the 1996 Act, which\n                  empowered her to conduct the proceedings in the manner which she\n                  deemed best appropriate and also to determine admissibility,\n                  relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.       The admitted\n                  position, nonetheless, as she had noted, was that the said documents\n                  were in fact filed before this Court along with OMP (I) No. 28/2016\n                  and Arb. Pet. 585/2016. The notice dated 28 January 2016 and the\n                  postal receipt whereby it was dispatched to Meera, as the learned\n                  Arbitrator correctly notes, also finds reference in the order dated 4\n                  November 2016 passed by this Court in Arb Pet 585/2016, whereby\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_345\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_346\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                 Page 72 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_347\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_348\">12:33:14</span>\n                   Mukul Mudgal, J. was appointed as the sole arbitrator to arbitrate on\n                  the disputes.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">                  55.16 In that view of the matter, it cannot be said that the decision of\n                  learned Arbitrator, in her order dated 4 February 2020, to allow the\n                  said documents to be taken on record, resulted in any miscarriage of\n                  justice or suffered from patent illegality. The only one of the said\n                  documents which forms subject matter of contest in the present\n                  proceedings is the letter dated 28 January 2016 and, specifically, the\n                  fact of its having been issued to, and received by, Meera. On that\n                  aspect, the learned Arbitrator had, for independent reasons, found the\n                  contention of Meera regarding non-service of the said notice not to be\n                  sustainable, and I find no reason to interfere with the said decision in\n                  exercise of the limited jurisdiction conferred by <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 34</a> of the\n                  1996 Act. It has to be remembered that the Court, while exercising\n                  <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 34</a> jurisdiction would not interfere with findings of the learned\n                  Arbitrator, even if they are erroneous on facts or in law, unless they\n                  suffer from patent illegality or perversity as defined by the Supreme\n                  Court in the decisions already cited earlier in this judgment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">                  55.17 What Mr Mata exhorts this Court to do is to revisit the material\n                  which was on record as evidencing receipt of the notice dated 28\n                  January 2016 by strictly applying the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_207\">Evidence Act</a>\n                  and, in the manner in which a civil court trying the matter in a suit\n                  would proceed, to hold that the evidence did not unequivocally\n                  establish service of the notice dated 28 January 2016 on Meera. The\n                  grounds on which Mr. Mata seeks to question the receipt of the notice\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_349\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_350\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_351\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                     Page 73 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_352\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">12:33:14</span>\n                   dated 28 January 2016 by Meera involve an entire reappreciation of\n                  the evidence relating to dispatch and receipt of the notice. Such an\n                  endeavour cannot be undertaken by this Court, while exercising\n                  jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 34</a> of the 1996 Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">                  55.18 For these reasons, the findings, of the learned Arbitrator, that\n                  the notice dated 28 January 2016 was, in fact, dispatched by Priti and\n                  received by Meera does not suffer from any patent illegality as would\n                  justify interference under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 34</a> of the 1996 Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_244\">                  56       Re-limitation\n\n\n                  56.1 That the period of limitation which applies in the present case is\n                  three years, irrespective of the Article of the Limitation Act which\n                  would apply, is not in dispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_245\">                  56.2 It is also not in dispute that the period of three years would have\n                  to be reckoned backwards from 28 January 2016, when the purported\n                  notice invoking arbitration under <a href=\"/doc/1712157/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 21</a> of the 1996 Act was sent\n                  by Priti to Meera.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_246\">                  56.3 Mr. Mata has sought to contend that he had not accepted the\n                  date of termination of the ATS as the starting point for limitation.\n                  Rather, it is submitted that the date of termination of the ATS was\n                  only one of the five dates from which, according to Mr. Mata,\n                  limitation for instituting arbitration would commence.

Second, it must be noted that a failure by an Arbitral\n                           Tribunal to deal with every issue referred to it will not ordinarily\n                           render its arbitral award liable to be set aside. The crucial question\n                           in every case is whether there has been real or actual prejudice to\n                           either (or both) of the parties to the dispute. In this regard, the\n                           following passage in Redfern and Hunter correctly summarises the\n                           position:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">                                    The significance of the issues that were not dealt with has\n                                    to be considered in relation to the award as a whole. For\n                                    example, it is not difficult to envisage a situation in which\n                                    the issues that were overlooked were of such importance\n                                    that, if they had been dealt with, the whole balance of the\n                                    award would have been altered and its effect would have\n                                    been different.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_248\">                 As such, it is only if the point which has not been considered by the\n                 Arbitrator is one which, if considered, would affect the final award, or\n                 result in a different final outcome, that non-consideration of the point\n                 becomes a ground for interference under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 34</a>.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_359\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">                  60 2011 SGCA 33\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_360\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_361\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                               Page 75 of 96</span>\nSigning Date:05.12.2023\n12:33:14\n                   56.5 In the present case, the findings of the learned Arbitrator on the\n                  points of limitation read thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">                           &quot;58. The submission of the respondent that that ATS stood\n                           terminated on 15.1.2013 is also a wrong submission. The document\n                           dated 30.1.2013 is the termination notice sent by the respondent to\n                           the claimant. The language contained in this document is clear and\n                           unequivocal. This document has been relied upon by the\n                           respondent. A perusal of the contents of this document shows that\n                           it was on 30.1.2013 that the respondent had terminated the ATS\n                           with the claimant. It inter alia states: &quot;This in view of the aforesaid\n                           breaches committed by you, the agreement dated 24.12.2015 is\n                           hereby terminated with immediate effect and the earnest money of\n                           Rs. 12.5 crores paid by you is forfeited as provided in the\n                           agreement&#x27;&#x27;. It was this notice which had &quot;new&quot; terminated the\n                           ATS. The notice invoking arbitration by the claimant dated\n                           28.1.2016: received by the respondent on 30.1.2016 was thus\n                           invoked within a period of 3 years from the date when the contract\n                           stood terminated. This period has to be counted from the date of its\n                           receipt which was obviously after 30.1.2013. The notice dated\n                           28.1.2016 fell within this period of 3 years. The cause of action for\n                           filing the claim petition qua both the claims in the present petition\n                           i.e. for the return of EMD amount of Rs. 12.50 crores and the\n                           second amount of Rs. 25.50 crores (in lieu of a security and an\n                           injury for non performance of the ATS by the respondent) would\n                           only arise once the ATS was terminated. The pre-suit interest of\n                           Rs. 19.55 crores also obviously could not have been cleared earlier.\n                           At the cost of repetition the ATS was terminated by the respondent\n                           on 30.1.2013. The notice invoking the arbitration is dated\n                           28.1.2016 i.e. within 3 years from 30.1.2013. All claims filed by\n                           the claimant are within the period of limitation.

The question of\n                           showing these title deeds to the claimant thus does not arise.\n                           Clause 3(a) clearly stipulated that the original title deeds had to be\n                           got released by the respondent from the bank. At the cost of\n                           repetition there is no evidence filed by the respondent to show that\n                           he had taken back the title deeds from the bank. In fact in the\n                           course of the arguments a question had been put by this Tribunal to\n                           the respondent and his Counsel on this score for which his answer\n                           was absolutely evasive. Even before this Tribunal the respondent\n                           was not in a position to produce the original title deeds of the\n                           property. It is not as if this compulsory requirement envisaged that\n                           the respondent would hand over the title deeds to the claimant but\n                           the compulsory requirement was that he would obtain the title\n                           deeds from the Bank in order that the claimant could satisfy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_377\">Signature Not Verified     himself that the property was now free of encumbrance.

This was to safeguard\n                           the interests of the claimant in order that the respondent would not\n                           enter into any further agreement to sell with any third party\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_382\">Signature Not Verified     pending the completion of the sale with the claimant.

The\n                           letter dated 2.6.2012 sent by the Bank to the respondent clearly\n                           states that although a No Dues Certificate had been issued by the\n                           Bank to the respondent but the original papers of the said property\n                           were still lying with them with an advice to get them collected\n                           from the bank. There is no evidence either oral or documentary to\n                           substantiate that the original title deeds or the property were taken\n                           back by the respondent from the Bank. At the cost of repetition the\n                           respondent even on a specific query on this point had no answer.\n                           He was not able to show the title deeds even before this Tribunal.\n                           The first compulsory requirement required to be completed by the\n                           respondent was thus not completed by him.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_262\">                  57.2 To my mind, there is no substance whatsoever in Meera&#x27;s\n                  contention insofar as obtaining of the title deeds from the Bank is\n                  concerned. There is, indeed, nothing to indicate that the title deeds\n                  were obtained except for one stray statement made by RW-1 in his\n                  cross-examination.         Priti, from the stage of the notice invoking\n                  arbitration dated 28 January 2016, through the SOC filed before the\n                  learned Arbitrator as well as affidavit in evidence filed by her as CW-\n                  1, consistently adopted the stand that there was no compliance, by\n                  Meera, with any of the Compulsory Requirements envisaged in Clause\n                  3 of the ATS. Once there was an allegation of wholesale failure, on\n                  Meera&#x27;s part, to comply with Compulsory Requirements stipulated in\n                  Clause 3 of the ATS, it can obviously not be argued that there was no\n                  specific allegation of Meera having failed to obtain title deeds from\n                  the Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">                  57.3 I am also entirely in agreement with Mr. Sethi in his submission\n                  predicated on the assertion contained in SOD filed by Meera before\n                  the learned Arbitrator. The averments in the SOD are revealing, and\n                  are severely damaging to the submission that Mr. Mata seeks to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_387\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_388\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_389\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                              Page 81 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_390\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_391\">12:33:14</span>\n                   advance before this Court.

Hence all the compulsory\n                           requirements mentioned in Clause 3(a) to 3(c) of agreement to sell\n                           dated 24.12.2012 were completed by 02.06.2012.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_264\">                  Clearly, Meera has admitted that she only had the building plans\n                  sanctioned, Bank&#x27;s dues cleared, No Dues Certificate issued by the\n                  Bank and property demarcated by erection of pillars. Any reference to\n                  obtaining of the title deeds of the disputed property from the Bank is\n                  conspicuously absent in the SOD. It is therefore obvious that the title\n                  deeds, in fact, were not obtained from the Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_265\">                  57.4 The letter dated 2 June 2012 issued by the Bank also confirms\n                  this position. It is clearly stated in the letter that the loan had been\n                  adjusted and there was nothing due from Meera towards the Bank.\n                  However, the letter does not enclose the original title deeds. Rather, it\n                  calls upon Meera to take back the title deeds from the Bank. There is\n                  nothing - barring a lone statement in the record of cross-examination\n                  of RW-1 - to indicate that, in fact, the original title deeds were taken\n                  back by Meera from the Bank at any point of time.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_266\">                  57.5 The position that emerges from a reading of the evidence of\n                  RW-1 is interesting. The deposition of RW-1 insofar as it relates to\n                  obtaining of documents from the Bank, deserves to be reproduced,\n                  thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">                            During cross-examination on 17 October 2019:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">                                 &quot;The title deeds of the property were handed over to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_392\">Signature Not Verified      Respondent by the bank after 02.06.2012 i.e. after the time when</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_393\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_394\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                             Page 82 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_395\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_396\">12:33:14</span>\n                             the No dues certificate was given by the bank.

The\n                  subsequent statements made by RW-1 substantially dilute and, in fact,\n                  almost completely erode the value of that initial assertion.\n                  Immediately after making the said statement, RW-1, in the very next\n                  sentence, states that he would have to verify what documents were\n                  handed over by the Bank to Meera after No Dues Certificate had been\n                  given. In the next statement, while deposing that he could not recall\n                  whether, apart from the title deeds of the dispute property, any other\n                  document was handed over by the Bank to Meera, he immediately\n                  retracts on that assertion by stating that he was unaware whether\n                  Meera had personally received the title deeds or any other document\n                  from the Bank. Then again, he proceeds to make two statements\n                  which are contradictory to each other, stating, first, that he would have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_397\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_398\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_399\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                                 Page 83 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_400\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_401\">12:33:14</span>\n                   to check whether he was present with Meera at the time of receipt of\n                  documents and, immediately thereafter, voluntarily stating that he was\n                  always present with Meera during all transactions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_269\">                  57.7 RW-1 is, therefore, clearly an unreliable witness. While these\n                  assertions are themselves sufficiently damaging the case that Meera\n                  seeks to set up, the statements of RW-1 in his subsequent cross-\n                  examination on 11 November 2019 puts the nail in the coffin as it\n                  were. While, on 17 October 2019, RW-1 stated that he had to check\n                  the position, on 11 November 2019, after checking the actual position\n                  and scrutinizing the books, RW-1 executed a volte face, by stating that\n                  he was unable to trace out the details of the documents which were\n                  handed over by the Bank to Meera at the time of issuance of No Dues\n                  Certificate and further clarifying that he was not in possession of the\n                  said documents.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_270\">                  57.8 There is, therefore, effectively nothing to indicate that, in fact,\n                  at the time of issuance of the No Dues Certificate or at any time\n                  thereafter, original title deeds of the disputed property had been taken\n                  back by Meera. The specific stand adopted by Meera herself, in her\n                  SOD, clearly indicates to the contrary.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_271\">                  57.9 The onus to prove that she had complied with the Compulsory\n                  Requirements envisaged in Clause 3 of the ATS was clearly on Meera.\n                  She miserably failed to discharge that onus, insofar as the question of\n                  receipt of the original title deeds of the disputed property from the\n                  Bank was concerned.

For that matter, even in the SOD, while asserting\n                  that she had liquidated the dues of the Bank and obtained a No Dues\n                  Certificate, had the building plans sanctioned and had the property\n                  demarcated by erection of pillars within the time stipulated in that\n                  regard by Clause 3 of the ATS, Meera sought to contend that,\n                  therefore, that she had complied with all Compulsory Requirements\n                  envisaged by the said Clause. In so asserting, Meera seems to have\n                  forgotten that an additional Compulsory Requirement envisaged by\n                  Clause 3(a) of the ATS was obtaining of the original title deeds from\n                  the Bank.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_272\">                  57.10 The learned Arbitrator has also relied on Clauses 8 and 9 of the\n                  ATS to emphasize why the obtaining of the original title deeds from\n                  the Bank was necessary. The findings, in that regard, by the learned\n                  Arbitrator have not been questioned by Meera either during oral\n                  arguments or in the written submissions tendered to the Court.

Re: Consequence of non-compliance by Meera with Clause 3(a)\n                  of the ATS\n\n\n                  58.1 The learned Arbitrator, relying on the judgment of the Supreme\n                  Court in Nathu Lal, holds that whether a contract envisages\n                  performing of obligations by the parties to the contract in a particular\n                  sequence, the obligations to perform a later act would arise only if the\n                  earlier act is first performed. Clause 5 of the ATS clearly envisaged\n                  payment of the balance sale consideration by Priti, by 10 April 2012\n                  only if, in the first instance, Meera completed the Compulsory\n                  requirements. This finding is, on a plain reading of Clause 5 of the\n                  ATS, clearly unassailable and indeed Meera has also not sought to\n                  join issue thereon. The finding of the learned Arbitrator that, as\n                  Meera had failed to comply with the Compulsory Requirements\n                  envisaged in Clause 3(a) of the ATS within the time stipulated in that\n                  regard, the time no longer remained of the essence of the contract and\n                  the requirement of Priti paying the balance sale consideration on or\n                  before 10 April 2012, as envisaged by Clause 5 of the ATS stood\n                  novated, does not call for any interference.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_276\">                  58.2 In view of the clear words of Clause 5 of the ATS, no real\n                  occasion to examine the applicability of the contractual principle of\n                  novation would arise.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_412\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_413\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_414\">By:HARIOM           OMP 5/2020                                                  Page 86 of 96</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_415\">Signing Date:05.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_416\">12:33:14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_277\">                   58.3 As there was no want of compliance, by Priti, of any obligation\n                  cast on her under the ATS, Meera could not have forfeited the EMD\n                  of â‚¹ 12.5 crores. Even in its judgment in Kailash Nath, the Supreme\n                  Court clearly held that EMD could not be forfeited unless the party\n                  forfeiting the EMD was not in default and had suffered a loss owing to\n                  the act of the opposite party. In the present case, the default being on\n                  the part of Meera, and not on the part of Priti, there could be no\n                  justification for Meera, to forfeit the EMD of â‚¹ 12.5 crores.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_278\">                  58.4 As such, the learned Arbitrator&#x27;s decision to direct refund of the\n                  amount of â‚¹ 12.5 crores to Priti calls for no interference.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_279\">                  58.5 Equally unassailable in law, in my view, is the direction of the\n                  learned Arbitrator for payment of â‚¹ 25.5 crores by Meera to Priti.\n                  Meera herself acknowledged, in her SOD, that the amount of â‚¹ 25.5\n                  crores represented security towards fulfillment, by Meera, of her\n                  obligations under the ATS.

We may at this juncture also note the following\n                           observations made by this Court in Saw Pipes:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">                                  &quot;64. ... <a href=\"/doc/1227984/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 74</a> emphasises that in case of breach of\n                                  contract, the party complaining of the breach is entitled to\n                                  receive reasonable compensation whether or not actual loss\n                                  is proved to have been caused by such breach. Therefore,\n                                  the emphasis is on reasonable compensation. If the\n                                  compensation named in the contract is by way of penalty,\n                                  consideration would be different and the party is only\n                                  entitled to reasonable compensation for the loss\n                                  suffered. But if the compensation named in the contract for\n                                  such breach is genuine pre-estimate of loss which the\n                                  parties knew when they made the contract to be likely to\n                                  result from the breach of it, there is no question of proving\n                                  such loss or such party is not required to lead evidence to\n                                  prove actual loss suffered by him. Burden is on the other\n                                  party to lead evidence for proving that no loss is likely to\n                                  occur by such breach.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_286\">                                                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_287\">                           43.

Even at the\n                  time of execution of the ATS, therefore, there was not only a clear\n                  understanding between Meera and Priti that Priti would be entitled, in\n                  the event of Meera defaulting in complying with her obligations under\n                  the ATS, to the amount of â‚¹ 25.5 crores, but PDCs for the said amount\n                  were also tendered by Meera.
