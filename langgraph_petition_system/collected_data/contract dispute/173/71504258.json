RAVEENDRAN, J. 1. Leave granted. Heard the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2. The appellant, by `Notice Inviting Tenders&#x27; dated 27.3.2001, invited\nbids for supply of 441 LCKM of different sizes of Polythene Insulated Jelly\nFilled cables (`PIJF cables&#x27; for short). The tender procedure (vide clause\n13 of Special Conditions of Contract) required an evaluation of the bids,\nso as to limit the number of bidders selected for placing orders against\nthe tender, to two-third of the participating and eligible bidders in each\ngroup; and the bidders for placement of orders were to be selected from the\nlist of technically and commercially responsive bidders in each group\narranged in decreasing order of `Vendor Rating&#x27; starting from the highest.\nThe bidder with the highest Vendor Rating (V-1) was to be considered for\nplacing the order for about 30% of the tendered quantity and the balance\nquantity was to be distributed among the remaining selected bidders in each\ngroup in direct ratio of their Vendor Rating. Thus the quantity for which a\npurchase order was to be placed by BSNL on a bidder depended upon the\n`Vendor Rating&#x27; of such a bidder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">The first round of litigation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3. There were several bidders including the respondent and NICCO\nCorporation Ltd. BSNL awarded the highest vendor rating (V-1), to NICCO.\nThe respondent claimed that on a proper evaluation of bidders, it should\nhave been given the highest Vendor Rating (V-1) in regard to 10P x 0.5 (UA)\nsize cable instead of NICCO; that if it had been adjudged as V-1, it would\nhave secured a Purchase Order for a quantity of 5.842 LCKM from BSNL; that\nas NICCO was adjudged as V-1, the appellant treated the respondent as one\nof the `other bidders&#x27; and consequently placed an order only for a quantity\nof 0.536 LCKM; and that resulted in a shortfall of 5.306 LCKM in the order\nplaced on it. The respondent therefore filed Writ Petition [C] No.5808/2001\nin the Delhi High Court on 18.9.2001 alleging that BSNL had arbitrarily\nadjudged NICCO as the person with the highest Vendor Rating thereby pushing\nit down to the category of `other bidders&#x27; which adversely affected the\nsize of its order. It prayed for the following reliefs :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(a)\tto quash the Advance Purchase Orders dated 11.9.2001 issued by BSNL\nto NICCO.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(b)\tto issue a direction to BSNL to issue fresh Advance Purchase Orders\nin terms of the Vendor Rating as on 22nd May, 2001 (date of the opening of\nthe Tender) to it (respondent herein); and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(c)\tto quash the Revised Delivery Rating of NICCO as set out in the\nInternal Office memo dated 27.7.2001.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4. A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court allowed the said writ petition\nby order dated 29.4.2004 (reported in (2004) Delhi Law Times 112). It held\nthat assessment of Vendor Rating done by BSNL in regard to NICCO was not\nproper. It therefore directed BSNL to redo the Vendor Rating by following\nthe formulae laid down in the tender document, as indicated in the\njudgment. As the High Court was aware that by then contracts had already\nbeen awarded in respect of most of the tendered quantity and only a\nnegligible quantity remained, it issued the following consequential\ndirection :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;In this court&#x27;s order dated 9.10.2002, it is recorded that there are some\nsupplies which are to be made for which no orders have been placed. . If\nthe petitioner is rated as V-1, then it shall be given the benefit in the\nbalance supplies that are yet to be made.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">The High Court then proceeded to make the following observation, even\nthough there was no claim for compensation/damages in the writ petition :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;If after adjusting the balance amount the petitioner is still entitled to\nfurther supplies then it will be open to the petitioner to pursue its\nremedies against the respondents for compensation/damages that may be\navailable to it in law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">The special leave petition filed by BSNL against the said judgment was\ndismissed by this court on 1.4.2005. The decision of the High Court thus\nattained finality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">The second round of litigation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">5. By the time the said decision was rendered on 29.4.2004, BSNL, as per\nits policy, had already carried forward the balance quantity of the Tender\ndated 27.3.2001 to the next tender issued in 2002 and had even placed the\npurchase orders on the successful bidders against the said tender issued in\n2002. (BSNL claimed that its counsel had erroneously submitted to the court\nduring hearing of the first writ petition that some quantity still remained\nto be ordered. Be that as it may). Therefore, according to BSNL, no balance\nquantity was available and no order for any further quantity could be\nplaced with the respondent, even if the respondent was to be given V-1\nrating on a re-evaluation. The respondent was aggrieved that the BSNL did\nnot adjudge it as V-1 and did not place orders for further quantities, as\nper the direction of the High Court. According to the respondent, on\naccount of the failure on the part of BSNL to adjudge it with V-1 rating,\nand consequential failure to place a purchase order for 30% tendered\nquantity, it was denied the opportunity to manufacture and supply a\nquantity of 5.306 LCKM of cables, resulting in a loss of profit at the rate\nof Rs.200/- per CKM (or Rs.2 crores per LCKM) on the quantities for which\nit did not get an order; and therefore it was entitled to Rs.10,61,20,000/-\nas damages from BSNL.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">6. The respondent issued a notice dated 26.10.2005 calling upon the\nappellant to pay the said amount as compensation. The demand was reiterated\non 28.4.2006. BSNL rejected the claim by its reply dated 10.7.2006. The\nrespondent therefore filed a second writ petition (WP [C] No.18393/2006) on\n27.9.2006 seeking a direction to the appellant to comply with the decision\nrendered on 29.4.2004 by paying a sum of Rs.10,61,20,000/- with interest\nfrom the date of demand (26.10.2005) till the date of payment, with costs\nof Rs.20,000/-. The said writ petition came up for consideration on\n11.12.2006 before a learned Single Judge of the High Court and arguments\nwere heard for some time. When the respondent found that it would not be\npossible for it to get a direction for payment of compensation in the writ\npetition, it sought to withdraw the petition, with liberty to take\nappropriate civil remedies. The second writ petition was therefore\ndismissed as withdrawn reserving liberty as prayed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">The third round of litigation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">7. Thereafter, the respondent issued a notice dated 30.6.2007 through\ncounsel, to BSNL suggesting that the disputes between them (for payment of\nRs.10,61,20,000/- as damages to respondent) be referred to arbitration.\nBSNL by its reply dated 17.7.2007 rejected the request for arbitration. The\nrespondent therefore filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_1\">section 11(6)</a> of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (`the Act&#x27; for short) in Arbitration\nPetition No. 461/2007 for appointment of an Arbitrator to decide its claim\nfor Rs.10,61,21,000/-. The appellant resisted the said petition on the\nground that there could be no arbitration in regard to the said claim. A\nlearned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court, by the impugned order dated\n1.8.2008, has allowed the said application and appointed a retired Judge of\nthe Delhi High Court as an Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">Questions for consideration\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">8. On the contentions urged, two questions arise for consideration:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(i)\tWhether there exists an arbitration agreement between the parties ?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(ii)\tEven if there is an arbitration agreement, whether the respondent,\nhaving availed the public law remedy in regard to its grievance, will be\nentitled to again seek remedy by way of arbitration?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">Relevant provisions of the bid documents\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">9. The Bid Documents in regard to the tender issued on 27.3.2001 consisted\nof twelve sections. Section I consisted of Notice Inviting Tenders. Section\nII consisted of Instructions to Bidders. Section III consisted of General\nConditions of Contract. Section IV consisted of Special Conditions of\nContract. Sections V and VI consisted of Schedule of Requirements and\nTechnical Specifications. Schedule VII consisted of Bid Form and Price\nSchedules. Schedule XI contained the Price Variation Table. Sections VIII,\nIX, X and XII contained formats of Bid Security form, Performance security\nbond, Bidder&#x27;s Authorization Letter and Declaration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">10. Definition clause 1(f) of Instructions to Bidders defined `Purchase\nOrder&#x27; as meaning &quot;the order placed by the Purchaser on the Supplier,\nsigned by the Purchaser including all attachments and appendices thereto\nand all documents incorporated by reference therein. The purchase order\nshall be deemed as `Contract&#x27; appearing in the document.&quot; Clause 28 of\nInstructions to Bidders clarified that the issue of purchase order shall\nconstitute the award of contract on the bidder. Clause 26 of Instructions\nto bidders made it clear that BSNL could reject any or all bids. The said\nclause is extracted below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;The Purchaser reserves the right to accept or reject any bid, and to annul\nthe bidding process and reject all bids, at any time prior to award of\ncontract without assigning any reason whatsoever and without thereby\nincurring any liability to the affected bidder or bidders on the grounds of\npurchaser&#x27;s action.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">Clause 30 of the Instructions to bidders related to jurisdiction and the\nsame is extracted below :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;COURT JURISDICTION: The contract shall be governed by Indian laws and\ncourts at Delhi/New Delhi will have jurisdiction to entertain any dispute\nor claim arising out of this tender till issue of authorization letters to\nCircles for placement of Purchaser Orders(P.O.s)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">(emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">11. Section III (General Conditions of Contract) started with the preamble\n(in clause 1) that the General Conditions shall apply to contracts made by\nBSNL for the procurement of goods. Clause 20 of the General Conditions of\nContract provided for arbitration and relevant portion thereof is extracted\nbelow :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;20. ARBITRATION:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(20.1.) In the event of any question, dispute or difference arising under\nthis agreement or in connection therewith except as to the matters, the\ndecision of which is specifically provided under this agreement, the same\nshall be referred to sole arbitration of the CMD, BSNL, New Delhi or in\ncase his designation is changed or his office is abolished then in such\ncase to the sole arbitration of the officer for the time being entrusted\n(whether in addition to his own duties or otherwise) with the functions of\nthe CMD, BSNL or by whatever designation such an officer may be called\n(hereinafter referred to as the said officer), and if the CMD, BSNL or the\nsaid officer is unable or unwilling to act as such, then to the sole\narbitration of some other person appointed by the CMD, BSNL or the said\nofficer. The agreement to appoint an arbitrator will be in accordance with\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_2\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.... &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">The first question\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">12. At the outset, what should be noticed is that there was no contract or\nagreement between the parties (except in regard to the contracted quantity\nof 0.536 LCKM for which an order was placed by BSNL, but which is not the\nsubject matter of the present dispute). Bid documents did not constitute a\ncontract, or an agreement or an agreement to enter into a contract. It was\nmerely an invitation to make an offer. It informed the prospective bidders,\nhow they should make their bids; how the bids would be processed by BSNL;\nhow contracts would be entered by placing purchase orders; and what terms\nwould govern the contracts, if purchase orders were placed. Some sections\nof the bid documents governed the tender process which preceded the placing\nof purchase orders. Some sections contained the forms in which the bid\nshould be made by the bidder. Other sections of bid documents contained\nprovisions which would govern the contracts, when purchase orders were\nplaced by BSNL by accepting the bid. For example, Section I (Notice\nInviting Tenders) and Section II (Instructions to bidders) had nothing to\ndo with the performance of the contract. They relate to the pre-contract\nprocess of bidding, that is who would be eligible to make bids and how the\nbids should be made. On the other hand, Section III had nothing to do with\nthe bidding process or selection of suppliers, but contained provisions\nwhich would govern the performance - that is the terms and conditions of\nthe contract - if and when contracts were entered by placing purchase\norders. The arbitration clause (clause 20) is a part of Section III of the\nBid documents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">13. As per the scheme of Bid documents, there is a clear division of the\nterms that will govern the tender process, and the terms that will govern\nthe contract, when the bids are accepted. One part regulated the tender\nprocess that led to placing of purchase orders. That part contained a\nprovision as to what should be the forum of dispute resolution, if there\nwas a dispute at the tender or bidding stage. The other part stipulated the\nterms and conditions which will govern the contract, if and when purchase\norders were placed. That part also contained a provision as to what should\nbe the forum if there was a dispute after the contract was entered. Clause\n30 of Instructions to Bidders makes it clear that in regard to tender-stage\ndisputes, the forum will be Civil Courts. Clause 20 of General Conditions\non the other hand was intended to operate when contracts were made and it\nspecified that if disputes arose in regard to the contracts, the forum for\ndispute resolution will be the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">14. Clause 1 of the General Conditions of Contract (Section III) makes it\nclear that the General Conditions of Contract contained in Section III of\nthe document shall apply in contracts made by the purchaser for the\nprocurement of goods. Clause 20 of Section III, that is the arbitration\nclause makes it clear that arbitration is available in regard to `any\nquestion, dispute or difference arising under this agreement or in\nconnection therewith&#x27;. Therefore, it is evident that the General Conditions\nof Contract (Section III) and clause 20 therein providing for arbitration,\nwill not apply in regard to any dispute in regard to the tender or bid, or\nnon-placing of a purchase order, but will apply only in regard to any\ncontract awarded by BSNL by placing a purchase order. A contract is entered\nin pursuance of the bid, when a purchase order is placed by BSNL on a\nbidder (vide clauses 1(f) and 28 of Section II - Instructions to Bidders).\nWhen a purchase order is not placed, there is no contract or agreement and\nif there is no contract or agreement, the terms of General Conditions\nincluding the arbitration clause do not come into existence. In other words\nthere is no arbitration agreement at all. BSNL intended to have\narbitrations only where it had entered into contracts and there were\ndisputes relating to such contracts. It did not intend to have arbitrations\nin regard to tender stage disputes or pre-contract differences, at a stage\nwhen there was no privity of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">15. It is also very significant that Section II (Instructions to Bidders)\nand Section IV (Special Conditions) which are relevant at the bid stage do\nnot contain any arbitration clause providing that if there is any dispute\nbetween BSNL and a bidder in regard to the bid/tender process, the dispute\nwill be settled by arbitration. On the other hand, the Instruction to\nBidders contains a specific provision that if there is a dispute or claim\narising out of the tender till (issue of authorization for) placement of\nthe purchase order, only courts will have jurisdiction. Of course, as and\nwhen appellant placed a purchase order on a bidder, the purchase order\ncontained a term that the General conditions of contract, forming part of\nthe bid documents would be a part of the contract documents, and\nconsequently the arbitration clause applied to the contracts entered\nbetween BSNL and the bidders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1159642\" id=\"span_1\">16. We may in this behalf usefully refer to the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1159642/\" id=\"a_3\">Dresser Rand\nS.A. vs. Bindal Agro Chem.Ltd</a> (2006) 1 SCC 751 wherein this Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;27. The tender document or the invitation to bid of BINDAL (containing the\n&quot;instructions to bidders&quot; and the &quot;general conditions of purchase&quot;), by\nitself, is neither an agreement nor a contract. The instructions to bidders\ninformed the intending bidders how the bid should be made and laid down the\nprocedure for consideration and acceptance of the bid. The process of\nbidding or submission of tenders would result in a contract when a bid or\noffer is made by a prospective supplier and such bid or offer is accepted\nby BINDAL. The second part of the Invitation to Bid consists of the\n`General Conditions of Purchase&#x27;, that is, the conditions subject to which\nthe purchase order will be placed or offer will be accepted. The `General\nConditions of Purchase&#x27; were made available as a part of the Invitation to\nbid, so as to enable the prospective suppliers to ascertain their\nobligations and formulate their offers suitably.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;32. Parties agreeing upon the terms subject to which a contract will be\ngoverned, when made, is not the same as entering into the contract itself.\nSimilarly, agreeing upon the terms which will govern a purchase when a\npurchase order is placed is not the same as placing a purchase order. A\nprelude to a contract should not be confused with the contract itself. The\npurpose of Revision No. 4 dated 10.6.1991 was that if and when a purchase\norder was placed by BINDAL, that would be governed by the &quot;general\nconditions of purchase&quot; of BINDAL, as modified by Revision No. 4. But when\nno purchase order was placed, neither the `general conditions of purchase&#x27;\nnor the arbitration clause in the `General Conditions of Purchase&#x27; became\neffective or enforceable.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">17. Therefore, only when a purchase order was placed, a `contract&#x27; would be\nentered; and only when a contract was entered, the General Conditions of\nContract including the arbitration clause would become a part of the\ncontract. If a purchase order was not placed, and consequently the general\nconditions of contract (Section III) did not become a part of the contract,\nthe conditions in Section III which included the arbitration agreement,\nwould not at all come into existence or operation. In other words, the\narbitration clause in Section III was not an arbitration agreement in\npraesenti, during the bidding process, but a provision that was to come\ninto existence in future, if a purchase order was placed. In this case, the\ndispute raised is in regard to a claim for Rs.10,61,28,000/- as damages on\naccount of BSNL not placing a purchase order, that is loss of profit @\nRs.200/- per CKM for a quantity of 5.306 LCKM. Obviously the respondent\ncannot invoke the arbitration clause in regard to that dispute as the\narbitration agreement was non-existent in the absence of a purchase order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1538559\" id=\"span_2\">18. The respondent contended that BSNL has entered into a contract with it\nin respect of a quantity (0.536 LCKM), and as the dispute raised was\nwhether the contract quantity should be more, the arbitration clause was in\nforce and available. The contention has no merit. The arbitration agreement\nwas available in regard to the contract for 0.536 LCKM. But in the absence\nof any purchase order in respect of 5.306 LCKM by BSNL on the respondent,\nrespondent cannot seek recourse to the arbitration agreement contained in\nclause 20 of Section III of the bid document, in regard to a dispute\nrelating to that quantity for which order was not placed. It is not\nsufficient to show that there was an arbitration agreement in regard to\nsome contract between the parties. To constitute an arbitration agreement\nfor the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_5\">11</a> of the Act, two requirements should be\nsatisfied. The first is that there should be an arbitration agreement\nbetween the parties to the dispute. The second is that it should relate to\nor be applicable to the dispute in regard to which appointment of\nArbitrator is sought (See <a href=\"/doc/1538559/\" id=\"a_6\">Yogi Agarwal v. Inspiration Clothes &amp; U</a> - 2009\n(1) SCC 362). For the foregoing reasons, we hold that in the absence of an\narbitration agreement, the application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_7\">section 11</a> of the Act was not\nmaintainable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">Some collateral issues\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">19. This case makes it necessary to refer to two areas of concern. The\nfirst relates to misuse by litigants, of routine observations made by\ncourts reserving liberty to a litigant to seek further remedy, while\ndisposing the matters, to claim non-existent rights and remedies. Second\nrelates to the unenviable position to which public undertakings are\nreduced, for lack of freedom and unnecessary litigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">Misuse of liberty reserved for further action\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">20. In the first writ petition filed by the respondent, the issue was\nwhether the BSNL while evaluating the bidders had committed an error in\nadjudging NICCO as V-1 (vendor with the highest rating). The assessment of\nvendor rating (VR) was governed by the following formula : VR = 0.6PR +\n0.3DR + 0.1 QR (PR, DR and QR referring to price rating, delivery rating\nand quality rating). The formula for arriving at PR was simple. QR did not\ninvolve any formula. But the formula prescribed to arrive at DR was\ncomplicated. The High Court found that the delivery rating (DR) of NICCO\nwas modified by BSNL on a representation by NICCO, which led to NICCO,\nbeing adjudged as V-1. The High Court found that the modification of\nDelivery Rating was not warranted and consequently held that the vendor\nrating of NICCO was not proper. But it did hold that there was any\nmalafides, bias or arbitrariness in the process of assessment of vendor\nrating by BSNL. In other words, the rating of NICCO as V-1 was apparently\non account of a bonafide error in assessment or wrong understanding of the\nprinciples relating to assessment of Vendor Rating. The High Court directed\ncorrection of that error. The High Court was also aware that by the time it\ndecided the writ petition, BSNL had completed the process of placing of\npurchase orders and only a very small quantity remained unallotted (In fact\naccording to BSNL even this quantity had been transferred to next year&#x27;s\ntender). Consequently, the High Court while disposing of the first writ\npetition directed the BSNL to reassess the vendor rating, and if as a\nresult the respondent secured V-1 rating, to allot to it, any unallotted\nquantity of cables. So far so good.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">21. But the High Court did not stop there. It proceeded to observe at the\nend of the order that after giving effect of balance supply, if the\nrespondent was entitled to further supplies, it will be open to the\nrespondent to pursue its remedies against the appellant for\ncompensation/damages that may be available to it in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">22. Where the terms of the bid documents barred any claim being made on\naccount of the rejection or non-acceptance of any bid, the bid inviter\nwould not incur any liability to any aggrieved bidder, and the bidder would\nnot have any cause of action in private law. But as the bids were invited\nby BSNL, which is `state&#x27; for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 12</a>, a writ petition\nwas entertained, when respondent alleged arbitrariness in the process of\nassigning vendor-rating. In the absence of a finding in regard to\narbitrariness, bias or malafides in the decision but only a mere error in\nassessment, the High Court ought not to have interfered in the tender\nprocess. In fact, it did not set aside the contract awarded to NICCO. But\nthe High Court chose to issue a direction for re-assessment of the vendor\nrating and if respondent was found to have V-1 rating, then place a\npurchase order for the quantity that remained over after all the purchase\norders. This was unobjectionable as a public law remedy. Having done so,\nthere was no justification for the High Court to make any observation\nregarding compensation, as that was impermissible on the facts and\ncircumstances, either in public law or private law. In fact, it was not\nbased on any prayer. That unwarranted observation while disposing of the\nfirst writ petition, though it did not cast any liability on BSNL, was\nsufficient to persuade the designate of the Chief Justice while exercising\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_9\">section 11</a> of the Act to assume that the High Court in\nthe order dated 29.4.2004 had ordered the respondent to pursue the remedy\nagainst the appellant for compensation/damages and therefore, an arbitrator\nshould be appointed to decide the claim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">23. Instances abound where observations of the court reserving liberty to a\nlitigant to further litigate have been misused by litigants to pursue\nremedies which were wholly barred by time or to revive stale claims or\ncreate rights or remedies where there were none. It is needless to say that\ncourts should take care to ensure that reservation of liberty is made only\nwhere it is necessary, such reservation should always be subject to a\nremedy being available in law, and subject to remedy being sought in\naccordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">Position of public undertakings\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">24. The second issue relates to the vulnerable position of public\nundertakings. More and more they are subjected to vexatious litigations and\nother travails which their competitors in the private sector do not\nnormally face. When public undertakings used to have monopoly and\ndischarged public duties, control by the government and legislature and\njudicial review by the Judiciary was an absolute necessity to safeguard\npublic interest and ensure transparency and accountability. But when public\nundertakings are required to compete with private sector, in commercial\nareas, controls by the executive and legislature (sometimes referred to as\npolitical bondage) and judicial review of their action, became a handicap\nwhich impedes their progress. A public undertaking is required to ensure\nfairness, non-discrimination and non-arbitrariness in their dealings and\ndecision making process. Their action is open to judicial review and\nscrutiny under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_10\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. They are required to\ntake out advertisements and undergo elaborate and time-consuming selection\nprocesses, whether it is purchase of materials or engaging of contractors\nor making appointments. Just to ensure that everyone is given a fair and\nequal opportunity, public undertakings are required to spend huge amounts\nand enormous time in elaborate tender processes. A proposal for a purchase\nof the value of Rupees Ten lakhs may involve a `material procurement\nexpenditure&#x27; of Rupees Two Lakhs in advertisements and tender evaluation\ncost, and a total tender process period ranging from three to six months. A\ncompeting private undertaking can go straight into market and negotiate\ndirectly and get the same material for Rupees five lakhs without any\nexpenditure in a week. Public undertakings to avoid being accused of\nmalafides, bias or arbitrariness spend most of their time and energy in\ncovering their back rather than in achieving development and progress. When\ncourts grant stay, the entire projects or business ventures stand still or\nget delayed. Even if ultimately the stay is vacated and the complaint is\nrejected as false, the damage is done as there is enormous loss to the\npublic undertaking in terms of time and increase in costs. The private\nsector is not open to such scrutiny by courts. When the public sector is\ntied down by litigations and controls, the private sector quietly steals a\nmarch, many a time at the cost of the public sector. We are not advocating\nless of judicial review. We are only pointing out that if the public sector\nhas to survive and thrive, they should be provided a level playing field.\nHow and when and by whom is the question for which answers have to be\nfound. Be that as it may.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">Conclusion :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">25. In view of our finding on the first issue, the second question does not\nsurvive for consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">26. Therefore, we allow this appeal, set aside the order and dismiss the\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n","numcites":9,"numcitedby":22,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":71504258,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"is purchase order a contract","formInput":"is%20purchase%20order%20a%20contract"},{"value":"r. v. raveendran ","formInput":"r.%20v.%20raveendran%20"},{"value":"judicial review","formInput":"judicial%20review"},{"value":"place of contract","formInput":"place%20of%20contract"},{"value":"general conditions of contract","formInput":"general%20conditions%20of%20contract"},{"value":"\"bias\"","formInput":"%22bias%22"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"damages and compensation","formInput":"damages%20and%20compensation"},{"value":"bsnl ","formInput":"bsnl%20"},{"value":"bharat sanchar nigam ltd.
