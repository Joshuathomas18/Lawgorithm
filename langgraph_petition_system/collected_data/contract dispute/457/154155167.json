The\npetitioners seek the extension of the tenure of the PSC for a further period\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 1 of 56</span>\n of 10 years i.e., till 14.5.2030. This right, the petitioners claim, based on\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">1.2   It is the stand of the petitioners that the extension of tenure of the\nPSC is required to take place without alteration of the subsisting terms.\nThe petitioners claim that the mutuality envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 2.1</a> of the\nPSC pertains to the periods in issue and not qua financial terms already\nagreed to by respondent no.1 and 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">2.    Therefore, much would turn upon how <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSCs is\nconstrued. Thus, for the sake of convenience, <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSCs is\nextracted hereafter:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      &quot;The term of this Contract, subject to the terms hereof and the\n      applicable laws, shall be for a period of twenty five (25) years\n      from the Effective Date, unless the Contract is terminated\n      earlier in accordance with its terms, but may be extended\n      upon mutual agreement between the Parties for a further\n      Period not exceeding five (5) years; provided that in the event\n      of Commercial Production of Natural Gas, which is expected\n      to continue beyond the end of the term of the Contract, the\n      Contract shall be extended for such a period up to but not\n      exceeding thirty five (35) years from the Effective Date, as\n      may be mutually agreed between the Parties to be sufficient to\n      permit the Contractor to maximize the production of Natural\n      Gas in accordance with good petroleum industry practice. If\n      the production of Crude Oil or of Natural Gas is expected to\n      continue beyond the end of the relevant period referred to\n      above, the Parties may agree to extend this Contract for a\n      further period upon such terms as may be mutually agreed.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.    Respondent no.1 and 2, who are charged with the responsibility of\ntaking a decision on the extension of the tenure of the PSC, resist the same,\non the ground that during the pendency of the writ petition, a New Policy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 2 of 56</span>\n stood framed, and therefore, grant of extension can only be on the terms\nand conditions stipulated therein.      This policy, which was framed on\n07.04.2017 (hereafter referred to as &quot;New Policy&quot;) according to respondent\nno. 1 and 2 should form the basis for extension of the PSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">3.1   According to respondents no. 1 and 2, the New Policy provides for a\ntransparent and defined framework for granting extension to operational\nPre-New Exploration Licensing Policy (Pre-NELP) exploratory PSCs. The\nNew Policy, thus, as per the stand of the respondent no.1 and 2, provides a\nlevel playing field to all contractors, who had secured for themselves Pre-\nNELP blocks for exploration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">3.2   It is the stand of respondent no. 1 and 2 that, the Government of\nIndia (GOI) is the owner of natural resources and, thus, holds sway over\nthe exploration blocks in the larger interest of the people of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">3.3   The logical sequitur of this argument is that the GOI cannot be\ndivested of its supervisory power in matters pertaining to national\nimportance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">4.    This, in effect, is the stand of respondent no. 1 and 2 on merits.\nThus, in line with the foregoing submission it is stated, on behalf of\nrespondent no.1 and 2 that the petitioners&#x27; were advised vide letter dated\n12.04.2017 to submit a formal application to seek approval of the extension\nof the PSC tenure in accordance with the New Policy framework.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">4.1   The respondent no.1 and 2, thus, take the line that the expression\n&quot;mutual agreement&quot; obtaining in <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC would mean that\nextension can only be granted in terms of the New Policy.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                                  Page 3 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\"> 5.    This apart the respondent no.1 and 2 take the objection that no writ\npetition would lie in respect of rights and obligation which are rooted in a\ncontract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">5.1   In this behalf, respondent no.1 and 2 have referred to the order dated\n14.12.2015, when, while issuing notice in the writ petition, this aspect was\ntaken note of.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">Background Facts:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">6.    Therefore, before I proceed to deal with the issues raised in the writ\npetition, I propose to set out the following broad facts which form the\nbackground in which the instant dispute has arisen between the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">6.1   On 15.5.1995, when, the PSC was first executed, there were two\nparties to the contract, i.e., ONGC and Shell India Production Development\nNV (hereafter referred to as &quot;Shell&quot;). At this point of time, Shell had 100%\nparticipating interest in the Rajasthan Block.     Via an addendum dated\n07.06.2000, Shell assigned 50% of its participating interest in the Rajasthan\nBlock in favour of an entity by the name of: Cairn Energy India Pvt. Ltd.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">(&quot;CEIL&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">6.2   On 27.07.2004, Shell assigned the remaining 50% of its participating\ninterest in the Rajasthan Block in favour of petitioner no.3/ CEHL. This\nwas captured in Amendment no.2 to the PSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">6.3   Since, GOI decided to exercise its back-in-option under the PSC,\nONGC was nominated to hold 30% of the participating interest in the\nRajasthan Block. Accordingly, at that juncture, the participating interest in\nthe Rajasthan Block was spread out as follows:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 4 of 56</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> (i) While Petitioner no.3 and CEIL held 35% each of the participating\ninterest, the balance 30% was held by ONGC.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">6.4   This arrangement underwent a change when on 18.10.2012, GOI\nallowed CEIL to assign its entire participating interest in favour of\npetitioner no.1/ CIL. This apart, a change in operatorship was also brought\nabout. Consequently, petitioner no.1 acquired 35% participating interest in\nthe Rajasthan Block and, was also, designated as the operator under the\nPSC. In this capacity, petitioner no.1 was required to act on behalf of its\njoint venture partners. Thus, in effect, at present, the participating interest\nin the Rajasthan Block is shared in the following manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(i)   Petitioner no.1 and 3 hold 35 % each of the participating interest,\nwhile ONGC holds 30%.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">7.    It is the case of the petitioners that though the PSC was executed as\nfar back in May, 1995, the delay in commencement of production of crude\noil and natural gas was attributable to respondent no. 1 and 2. Though a\nchart in that behalf comprising of dates and events has been appended to\nthe writ petition, it is not necessary to discuss the same in detail in view of\nthe nature of the controversy at hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">8.     Suffice it to say that according to the petitioners, on 15.09.2004,\n&quot;Commercial Discovery&quot; at Rajasthan Block was made which led to\ncommercial production of crude oil, in 2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">8.1   It is the case of the petitioners that, with the use of sound industry\npractices and latest technology, they were able to make 25 hydrocarbon\ndiscoveries in the Rajasthan Block.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                              Page 5 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\"> 9.     The petitioners&#x27; claim that they have made an additional investment\nof USD 4 billion towards development of fields and construction of pipe\nlines. It is the petitioners‟ say that there is considerable potential in the\nRajasthan Block provided latest petroleum industry practices are employed.\nIt is also the petitioners&#x27; assessment, that estimated recoverable reserves in\nRajasthan Block is approximately 1.2 billion Barrels of Oil Equivalent\n(&quot;BOE&quot;). Furthermore, according to the petitioners, out of this reserve, 466\nmillion BOE can be recovered if the tenure of the existing PSC is extended\ntill 2030.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">9.1    The petitioner no. 1 &amp; 3 claim that they have uptil now invested in\nthe Rajasthan Block moneys in excess of the Rs.30,000/- crores.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">9.2    It is also the say of the petitioners that currently GOI‟s revenue\nwhich includes its nominee/licensee is, approximately, 60-70% of the\nprevailing price; which includes the revenue from &quot;Profit Petroleum&quot;,\nroyalty, and cess.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">10.    It is in this background that on, 15.01.2009, petitioner no.1 made a\nrepresentation to respondent no.2 to extend the PSC tenure by 20 years i.e.,\nup to 14.05.2040.        In this communication, petitioner no.1, inter alia,\nindicated to respondent no.2, that if, enhanced oil recovery methods were\nused in addition to conventional recoveries schemes, it had the potential of\nincreasing the expected ultimate recovery by 10-20% of Stock-Tank Oil\nInitially In Place (hereafter referred to as &quot;STOIIP&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">10.1 In response thereto, vide communication dated 21.03.2009,\nrespondent no.2 requested petitioner no.1 to submit long term production\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                             Page 6 of 56</span>\n profiles of the Rajasthan Block to establish that the production line of the\nsaid block would continue beyond the current tenure of the PSC.\nFurthermore, petitioner no.1 was also told to furnish detailed break-up of\nadditional investment which was required to be made in the Rajasthan\nblock.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">10.2 In response thereto, petitioner no.1 vide its communication dated\n06.03.2009 provided the production profile and proposed investment,\nwhich, incidentally, was factored for development of both, existing\ndiscoveries and future potential of the Rajasthan Block.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">11.      Having received the requisite information from petitioner no.1,\nrespondent no. 2 did a wee bit of U-turn by indicating to it via its\ncommunication dated 31.03.2009 that it was in the process of framing\npolicy guidelines qua extension of PSCs beyond the initial contractual\nperiod. In this behalf, reference was also made to <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">12.      Pertinently, in view of the fact that no permission was granted to\nconduct further exploration activities in the Rajasthan Block beyond the\nexploration phase, further exploratory development could not be\nundertaken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">13.      It is the petitioners‟ say that, since, GOI issued office memorandum\ndated 1.2.2013 permitting contractors under PSCs to undertake further\nexploratory activities, in the mining areas, beyond the initial exploration\nperiod, albeit, on certain terms and conditions (such as Government‟s share\nof petroleum profits was not impacted), they recommenced their\nexploratory activities in the Rajasthan Block.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                             Page 7 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\"> 13.1 It is in this context that on 05.04.2013, petitioner no.1 wrote to\nrespondent no.1 that, while the known commercial production profile of the\nRajasthan Block extends beyond 2040, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC,\nextension by a period of 10 years beyond 2020 would suffice. The relevant\nobservation made in this communication is extracted hereafter for the sake\nof convenience:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">         &quot;At this point in time the PSC term is valid till 14 May 2020\n         while the known commercial production profile extends\n         beyond 2040. Also while all the stakeholders believe in the\n         further and huge potential of the block, we are keen and\n         ready to proceed with huge investments to find more and\n         more hydrocarbons. We will be able to firm up our\n         investment and action plans and with reasonable certainty\n         once the PSC term is formally extended.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">         The RJ-ON-90/1 PSC (pre NELP PSC) has been\n         contemplated extension of PSC term vide Art 2.1. It initially\n         provides for 5 years extension on general merit basis and in\n         the alternative 10 years extension if gas sales profile is\n         extending beyond 2020. It also provides for subsequent\n         extension for indefinite period. In the present case 10 years\n         extension is applicable. In respect of this 10 years extension\n         Art 2.1 uses the expression &quot;shall&quot; which is very significant\n         and positive. Art 2.1 also contemplates mutual agreement for\n         such extension and hence we hereby convey our agreement\n         for the same.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">                                                    (emphasis is mine)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">14.   Happily, since certain fields in the Rajasthan Block were also\nproducing natural gas along with crude oil, albeit, in excess of its\noperational needs, petitioner no.1 sought permission to sell excess\nquantities of natural gas, so produced, for a period up to 2 years. This\npermission was sought by petitioner no. 1 vide its communication dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 8 of 56</span>\n 30.01.2013 addressed to respondent no.1/GOI. The request was reiterated\nby petitioner no.1 vide communication dated 18.02.2013 and 12.03.2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">14.1 Consequent thereto, GOI vide letters dated 28.03.2013 and\n23.04.2013 accorded its approval for sale of gas to Gujarat Narmada valley\nFertilizers and chemical ltd (&quot;GNVFC&quot;) limited though to the extent of\n0.10 mmscmd.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">15.   In view of the fact that the production was better than expected and\nthere was lesser consumption of gas, petitioner no.1 vide letter dated\n20.5.2013 sought approval to increase the volume of gas to be sold to\nGNVFC from 0.10 mmscmd to 0.2 mmscmd. This request was made, once\nagain, vide letter dated 20.11.2013; though this time around approval was\nsought to sell 0.35 mmscmd volume of gas to GNVFC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">16.   As a matter of fact, via letter dated 02.07.2014, petitioner no. 1\nsought approval of GOI to sell gas beyond the test period to avoid shutting\noff wells, pending approval of Field Development Plan (&quot;FDP&quot;) addendum.\nThis review was sought as FDP-2005 did not envisage gas-sell as the field\nwas developed for captive consumption.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">16.1 It was petitioner no.1‟s stand that data collected from ongoing\nextended well test had established potential of production of gas from\nRaageshwari Deep Gas Fields (in short &quot;RDG fields&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_38\">17.   Petitioner no.1 in this behalf sought approval of the Management\nCommittee (&#x27;MC&#x27;). Pertinently MC comprises of four (4) members, out of\nwhich two (2) members represent respondent no.1 and 2.           Crucially,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 9 of 56</span>\n members representing respondent no. 1 and 2 are also conferred with Veto\nrights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">17.1 Despite this configuration, on 23.12.2014, MC approved revised\nFDP which enabled commercial sale of natural gas on the premise that it\nwould continue beyond the current tenure of PSC and was likely to go\nupto, at least, 2030.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">18.       The record shows that in the interregnum i.e. on 20.05.2013,\nrespondent no.2, apparently, had written to petitioner no.1 to give its\nsuggestions qua the draft policy formulated by it for grant of extension to\nPSCs awarded to private joint ventures, in cases where the economic life of\nthe field was not yet over.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">18.1 Consequently, petitioner no.1 vide communication dated 15.05.2013\ngave its suggestion qua the draft policy for grant of extension to subsisting\nPSCs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">18.2 Thereafter, several communications were sent in that behalf to all\nand sundry which, however, did not result in any fruitful result. Reliance\nin this regard is placed by the petitioners on communications dated\n16.05.2013, 23.10.2013, 03.12.2013 and 09.01.2014 and 04.02.2014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">19.       Finally, vide communication dated 31.03.2014 respondent no.1\nwrote to respondent no.2.      By virtue of this communication, it was\nindicated that respondent no. 2&#x27;s proposal for extension of PSCs had been\nexamined and, thereafter, a decision had been reached that consent of\nrespondent No.3‟s Board had to be taken before the proposal could be\nprocessed further. This view was taken in the background of the fact that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 10 of 56</span>\n respondent No.3 was one of the parties to contract, and also, GOI‟s\nnominee and licensee of the Rajasthan Block. A copy of this letter was\nmarked by respondent no.1 to petitioner no.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">20.    Consequent, thereto vide letter dated 01.04.2014, respondent no.2,\nformally wrote to petitioner no.1 that it had to obtain the consent of the\nrespondent No.3‟s Board before the proposal for extension of the PSC\ntenure could be re-submitted to respondent no.1/GOI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\">21.    Resultantly, petitioner no.1 wrote to respondent No.3 vide letter\ndated 07.04.2014 to accord its consent to the extension of tenure of the\nPSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">22.    In the same vein, respondent no.2, on 04.06.2014, wrote to\nrespondent No.3 to give its comments on petitioner no.1&#x27;s proposal for\nseeking extension of the PSC tenure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">23.    While, petitioner No.1 was awaiting a response from respondent\nNo.3 with regard to its view on extension of PSC tenure, it wrote another\nletter dated 11.06.2014 to respondent No.2. In this communication, while\nreiterating its view that the PSC, tenure ought to be extended, reference\nwas made to clause 4.5 of the Joint Operating Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">23.1 Based on the said provision, it was contended that being the operator\nof the Rajasthan Block, it was entitled to request for extension of the tenure\nof the PSC. It was the say of petitioner No.1 that under <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_8\">Articles 2.1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_9\">5.6</a>\nof the PSC, neither the Operating Committee (&#x27;OC&#x27;) nor the MC had any\nrole to play in the matter involving extension of tenure of the PSC. The\nthrust of the communication was that involvement of the MC, at this stage,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 11 of 56</span>\n would not only delay the matter but would also cause significant loss to the\nexchequer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">23.2 Importantly, in this communication, emphasis was laid by petitioner\nNo.1 on the fact that it was already producing 2 lakh barrels of crude oil\nfrom Rajasthan block alone which was nearly 1/4th of the entire domestic\nproduction. It indicated to respondent No.2 that it had plans to explore,\ndevelop and produce higher volumes in future -- a circumstance which if\nallowed to occur would help the country as GOI otherwise, was importing\n80% of its crude oil requirement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">24.    Via letter dated 12.06.2014, respondent No.3, in response to\npetitioner No.1‟s letter of 04.02.2014 not only sought a break-up of\nprojected figures of production and planned investments in Rajasthan block\nbut also a response to its proposal for extension of tenure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">24.1   Petitioner No.1, vide written letter dated 20.06.2014, promptly\nsupplied the information sought by respondent No.3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">25.    On 14.08.2014, petitioner No.1 apprised GOI that it had submitted\nRDG FDP addendum, wherein, a proposal was made for commercial\nproduction of gas beyond 2030 at the plateau rate of 0.9 mmscfd. The\nemphasis on behalf of petitioner No.1 was that since <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC\nplaces an obligation on it to maximize the production of gas, it was\nagreeable to extend the same, in accordance with the provisions of the said\nArticle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">26.    In line with the aforesaid, on 15.09.2014, a resolution was passed by\nthe OC approving the revised RDG FDP.

This\nresolution bears the signatures of representatives of petitioner No.1 and\nrespondent No.3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">26.1 In the interregnum i.e. on 03.12.2013, petitioner No.1‟s parent\ncompany wrote to GOI seeking extension of the PSC tenure. Emphasis\nwas laid on the fact that extension of PSC should be automatic and the fact\nthat they had still not got approval qua the Rajasthan Block. It was also\nstressed that the GOI had earned revenue of Rs.24,000 crores from\npetitioner No.1 during the subsistence of the PSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">26.2 Interestingly the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) also got into\nthe fray and, accordingly, wrote to the GOI vide letter dated 18.12.2014,\nalbeit, in support of all explorers that Global petroleum industry practice\nfor PSC extension should be used as a reference point to frame guidelines,\nif the same were required to be formulated. CII emphasized that while\naccording extension, fiscal terms should remain unchanged and, in case the\nfiscal terms are being re-negotiated, they should be made more favourable\nto the contractors as it is important to ensure continuity of operations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_56\">27.   Pursuant to the resolution passed by the OC. (to which reference has\nbeen made above), MC at its meeting held on 23.12.2014 approved the\nrevised Raageshwari Deep Gas FDP excluding export gas pipeline. The\nresult was that the MC approved production profile of revised Raageshwari\nDeep Gas FDP till 31.12.2030.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                             Page 13 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\"> 28.    In line with the resolution passed by the MC, respondent No.3 vide\nits communication dated 27.01.2015 wrote to respondent No.2 that it had\napproved the revised FDP of RDG Field at its Board of Directors meeting\nheld on 21.01.2015, entailing gas delivery at RGT Battery limit with an\nestimated Capex of USD 531.20 million.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">29.    In sync with its earlier correspondence, on 19.02.2015, petitioner\nNo.1 via one of the MC members wrote to respondent No.2 as to why,\naccording to it, both, based on interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC and\neconomic rationale, the tenure of the PSC should be extended. In support\nof its argument for extension of tenure, reference was made to the fact that\nthe MC had approved the revised FDP qua RDG Field having regard to the\nfact that it had been established that commercial gas development could\ntake place at least till 2030.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">30.    Coincidently, vide a letter of even date i.e. 19.02.2015, respondent\nNo.3 wrote to respondent No.2 that they would like to hold a meeting to\ndiscuss the terms and conditions for extension of tenure of the PSC. In this\nregard, reference was made to the decision taken by respondent No.3‟s\nBoard of Directors on the subject, which, evidently was conveyed to GOI\nvia its letter dated 27.01.2015; a copy of which was dispatched to\nrespondent No.2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">30.1 Respondent No.2, via communication dated 20.02.2015, convened a\nmeeting on the issue on 23.02.2015. This communication was addressed\nboth to petitioner No.1 as well respondent No.3.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                          Page 14 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_61\"> 31.   Accordingly, a meeting was convened and at the meeting, after the\nviews of representatives of petitioner No.1, respondent No.2 and\nrespondent No.3 were heard, a decision was taken that respondent No.3 and\npetitioner No.1 would form a joint working group which would come up\nwith a common proposal for extension of tenure of the PSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">31.1 Resultantly, it was agreed that they would place their proposal with\nrespondent No.2 by 20.03.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">31.2 Significantly on 25.05.2015, respondent No.3 conveyed to GOI that\nits Board of Directors at its meeting dated 28.04.2015 had taken a decision\nthat the tenure of the PSC should be extended on the existing terms and\nconditions. Pertinently, in this letter respondent No.3 provided both\ncommercial and the legal rational which had propelled its Board of\nDirectors to reach such a conclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_64\">32.   It appears that pursuant to the issuance of the aforementioned letter\nof respondent No.3 to GOI, a meeting was convened on 18.06.2015,\namongst, the representatives of petitioner No.1, respondent No.2 and\nrespondent No.3 whereat the issue concerning extension of tenure was\ndiscussed once again. Respondent No.2 conveyed to the other participants\nthat GOI would expect an increase in the profit petroleum by at least 5%\nsubject to the condition that its share would be protected at the level of at\nleast 60% during the extended period of the PSC. Furthermore, respondent\nNo.2 conveyed to the other participants that uptil 31.03.2015, the profit\nshare of three constituents was as under:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">(i)   GOI                       :       USD 3.2 billion\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 15 of 56</span>\n (ii)    Petitioner No.1          :      USD 6.3 billion\n(iii)   Respondent No.3/ONGC :          USD 2.7 billion\n</pre><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">32.1 Importantly both petitioner No.1 and respondent No.3 conveyed to\nrespondent No.2 that existing fiscal terms and Contract Area to be extended\nwere not negotiable as per the prevailing terms of the contract obtaining\nbetween the parties. It was pointed out that the extension of the PSC was\nsought in terms thereof and not for the areas within the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_66\">32.3 Evidently, at this meeting, a query was raised by respondent No.2 as\nto why respondent No.3 had changed its view in the matter. The response\ngiven and as recorded in the drafts minutes of meeting being relevant, is\nextracted hereafter:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        &quot;.........ONGC representative responded that the latest ONGC\n        Board decision is based on the legal opinion obtained\n        subsequently from outside agency.

All these details were\n        also put up to Board, which were deliberated and was primarily\n        the basis to review the earlier decision as these activities were\n        likely to come/give results beyond the PSC period.

It appears that petitioner No.1 after having received the drafts\nminutes of meeting dated 18.06.2015, closely examined the profit share\nfigures placed at the meeting by respondent No.2.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                               Page 16 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_69\"> 33.1 Accordingly, petitioner No.1 sent a mail dated 03.07.2015 to\nrespondent No.2 with a copy to respondent No.3 with regard to the profit\nshare of each of the constituents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_70\">33.2 As per this mail, up to 31.03.2015, GOI‟s total profit share was USD\n6.1 billion which included profit petroleum and cess (includes NCCD) and\nnot USD 3.2 billion as was stated in the draft minutes. In addition thereto,\nit was also pointed out that the Government of Rajasthan had also earned\nmoney and that its total profit share uptil 31.03.2015 was USD 4.3 billion,\nout of which USD 3.8 billion was earned as royalty and USD 0.5 billion\nwas earned in the form of sales tax. Likewise, it was pointed out that while\nrespondent No.3‟s profit share was rightly recorded as USD 2.7 billion,\npetitioner No1‟s profit share was incorrectly recorded.       According to\npetitioner No.1, it had earned a total profit of USD 5.1 billion uptil\n31.03.2015 and not USD 6.3 billion as indicated in the draft minutes. The\nrelevance of this mail is that an attempt was made by petitioner No.1 to\nshow that the Government‟s entities had made more money than that which\nwas projected at the meeting dated 18.06.2015. In this connection,\npetitioner No.1 sent another mail dated 29.06.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_71\">34.   Pursuant to the meeting dated 18.06.2015, respondent No.3 wrote to\npetitioner No.1 via communication dated 22.07.2015 asking it to submit its\nproposed plan of action, reserve estimates, probable project economy and,\nlikely, GOI share -- so as to justify that the entire area should be retained\nduring the extended period of PSC. The said information was sought by\nrespondent No.3, from petitioner No.1, by 27.07.2015.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                          Page 17 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_72\"> 34.1 On 22.07.2015, respondent No.2 wrote to the petitioner.

Petitioner No. 1, thus, vide communication dated 25.07.2015 gave its\ncomments on the proposed policy sought to be formulated by the GOI for\nextension of Pre-NELP PSCs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_74\">35.1 In addition thereto, apropos to the letter of respondent No.3 dated\n22.07.2015, petitioner No. 1 vide letter dated 03.08.2015 supplied the\nnecessary details.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">35.2 Evidently, respondent No.3 vide letter dated 05.08.2015 sought\nfurther details from petitioner No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\">35.3 Given the fact that further information was sought by respondent\nNo.3, petitioner No.1 communicated to respondent no.3 that its help was\nrequired in expediting the technical evaluation process. Furthermore, it\nwas conveyed that since the Rajasthan Block resource estimates for many\nof the fields are only indicative, based on the current understanding, they\nare in no way binding on the parties. It was also suggested by petitioner\nNo. 1 that neither approval of OC or MC was required for the said exercise\nand that a high level technical understanding and alignment was sufficient\nto proceed jointly in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">36.   On 18.09.2015, petitioner No. 1 once again wrote to the GOI for an\nearly decision on the extension of PSC so that its joint venture partners\ncould commit to the additional investments to be made and there could be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                          Page 18 of 56</span>\n an increase in production, leading to maximization of economic recovery\nfrom the Rajasthan Block. To buttress its position, further facts and figures\nwere also given with regard to production of hydrocarbons from Rajasthan\nBlock. It was indicated that 300 million barrels of hydrocarbons were\nproduced which not only helped in reducing the country&#x27;s dependence on\nenergy imports but also saved nearly, a sum of USD 25 billion in foreign\nexchange for the country. Reference was also made to the fact that there\nwas a possibility of recovering nearly 1.2 billion BOEs from the Rajasthan\nBlock.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">37.     The record shows that via communication dated 16.10.2015,\nrespondent No.3 called upon petitioner No. 1 to convey to respondent\nNo.2, the recoverable potential of the Rajasthan Block beyond the PSC\nperiod, that is, till 2030 based on technical alignment between JV partners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_79\">37.1 Consequently, vide letter dated 20.10.2015, petitioner no.1\ncommunicated to respondent No.2 that the JV partners had deliberated on\nthe matter with regard to the remaining recoverable reserve potential of the\nRajasthan Block in the extended tenure period, that is, between 2020 and\n2030.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">37.2 It was, thus, conveyed by petitioner no.1 that JV partners were fully\naligned on the overall primary recoverable reserve potential of the\nRajasthan Block.     Petitioner No.1 stressed the point that the technical\nalignment achieved, demonstrated that the Rajasthan Block was estimated\nto hold a total recoverable resource potential of 1.128 BOEs. The break-up\nof this figure was also provided in the letter which reads as follows:\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 19 of 56</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              &quot;......0.280 bn boe has been produced till March 2015\n             0.382 bn boe incremental potential between FY15-16 to\n             FY19-20\n             0.466 bn boe incremental potential between FY19-20 to\n             FY29-30...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">38.

Consequently vide letter dated 05.11.2015, petitioner no.1 gave its\njustification for retaining the areas referred to in the PSC for its extension.\nSince endorsement of JV partners was also required to be given, petitioner\nNo. 1 vide letter dated 06.11.2015 wrote to respondent No.3 requesting for\na joint endorsement of commercials, as was sought by respondent No.2. In\nthis regard, a request was made that a meeting be convened.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">41.   Since, there was no movement in the matter, the petitioners took the\ndecision to move this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\nAccordingly, the captioned writ petition was filed which, as indicated\nabove, came up before this Court for the first time on 14.12.2015.

Given this background, let me briefly set out the arguments\nadvanced on behalf of the parties herein:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">Submissions of the counsel\n\n50.1 However, before I proceed further, it would be relevant to record that\nsubmission on behalf of the petitioner were advanced by Mr. C.A.\nSundaram, Senior Advocate, whereas, on behalf of respondent No.1/GOI\nand respondent No.2, submissions were advanced by Mr. Kirtiman Singh.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_101\">Likewise, on behalf of respondent No.3, arguments were made by Mr.Ajay\nKumar Jha and Mr. Sasiprabhu.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">50.2 It was the submission of the petitioners that the present case only\nrequires interpretation of one clause of the PSC i.e. <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 2.1.</a> Therefore,\naccording to the petitioners, notwithstanding the objection taken by the\nrespondents, a writ petition was maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution, as the issue raised would have impact on production of oil\nand natural gas available in the country. In other words, the petitioners\ncontend that the dispute relates to public law. Furthermore, the petitioners\ncontend that since, the respondents are not agreeable to the grant extension\nof tenure despite unambiguous provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 2.1</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                               Page 25 of 56</span>\n PSC, actions of the respondents are both unreasonable and arbitrary, and\ntherefore, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution would come into\nplay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">50.3 In this behalf, it was contended that the Rajasthan Block was not a\ndiscovered field, at the point in time, when, the PSC was executed between\nthe parties concerned. Respondent No.1/GOI had, in fact, devised the\nmethodology of putting in place a PSC so as to attract private investments\nfor exploration and development of Rajasthan Block. Accordingly, the\nPSC gave incentives for exploration and development of the Rajasthan\nBlock and, in consonance with said theme, stipulated therein that if there\nwas commercial production of natural gas, which was expected to continue\nbeyond the initial existing term of the PSC i.e. 2020, then, automatic\nextension for a further period of 10 years, albeit, on the same terms and\nconditions would be given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_104\">50.4 This, according to the petitioners, being in line with the good\npetroleum industry practice would enable maximization of production of\nnatural gas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">50.5 The failure on the part of respondent No.1/GOI to confirm extension\nof tenure of the PSC, based on the existing terms and conditions, was\naccording to the petitioners, not only creating a sense of uncertainty but as\nalso adversely affecting their future investment programs. In other words,\nthe lack of clarity on the issue was discouraging financers from lending\nmonies required for investment in the Rajasthan Block. This uncertainty,\naccording to the petitioners, was adversely and irrevocably affecting the\nviability and recoverability of crude oil from the Rajasthan Block.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 26 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_106\"> 50.6 It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that respondent\nNo.1/GOI would get 80%of the revenue over the life of the Rajasthan\nBlock and, therefore, increase in the revenue was in public interest.\nEmphasis was laid on behalf of the petitioners on the fact that till\nSeptember, 2017, the petitioners had paid over US$ 13.7 billion to\nrespondent No.1/GOI in the form of profit petroleum, royalty, cess and\nsales tax. Furthermore, it was also contended that so far as the petitioners\nwere concerned, it had already invested a sum of Rs.46,000 crores towards\nexploration, development and production, which was expected to increase\nto approximately Rs.54,000 crores by the end of financial year 2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">50.7 Importantly, it was sought to be brought to the notice of the Court\nthat <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 2.1</a> which stands incorporated in the instant PSC dated\n15.05.1995, was customized and was, therefore, distinctly different from\nthe Model Pre-NELP PSCs.

In this context, it was emphasized that the purpose\nof automatic extension was to enable the contractors to maximize the\nproduction of natural gas in accordance with good petroleum industry\npractice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">51.   Accordingly, my attention was drawn to the fact that there was no\ndispute that commercial production of natural gas from Rajasthan Block\nwas expected to continue beyond 2020 for a period of 10 years i.e. up to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                          Page 28 of 56</span>\n 14.05.2030. In this context, reference was made to the approval granted by\nthe MC to the revised FDP qua the Rajasthan Block, on the basis, that\ncommercial production of natural gas from the said block was expected to\ncontinue even beyond 2030.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">51.1 It was stated that it was for this reason that respondent No.3, on\n08.07.2016 during the pendency of the instant writ petition, had approved\nthe extension of PSC for a period of 10 years beyond the existing tenure,\nalbeit, on the same terms and conditions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">51.2 This decision, according to the petitioners, had the approval of the\nBoard of Directors of respondent No.3, which was taken at their meeting\nheld on 30.06.2016.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">51.3 In other words, it is contended that proviso to <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 2.1</a> adverts to\npetitioner No.1‟s accrued right of extension which, willy-nilly, stands\nvested in it. This right, according to the petitioners, is recognized in the\nPSC as other rights under <a href=\"/doc/839152/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 7.1.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">51.4 According to the petitioners, the New Policy was not applicable to\nthem as it was announced by respondent No.1/GOI during the pendency of\nthe instant writ petition. As per the directions issued by this Court on\n07.11.2016, respondent No.1/GOI was required to take a decision on the\nissue of extension of tenure of the PSC under <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 2.1</a> to the New Policy\nwithout linking it to policy guidelines. According to the petitioners, this\nwas contrary to the directions issued by this Court on 07.11.2016 and,\ntherefore, the communication dated 12.04.2017 served on the petitioners\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                          Page 29 of 56</span>\n calling upon them to apply under the New Policy was an attempt to\noverreach the directions issued by this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">51.5 It was, thus, contended on behalf of the petitioners, that the\nprovisions in the New Policy which require them to pay an additional sum\nof 10% had no nexus with the objective of improving the investment\nclimate so as to ensure expeditious exploration of resources and\nmaximization of production in the interest of energy security of the\ncountry.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">51.6 It is submitted that the action of respondent No.1/GOI in unilaterally\napplying the provisions of PSC by taking recourse to the New Policy was\nnot tenable in law. For this purpose, reliance was placed, on behalf of the\npetitioners on Article 34.2 of the PSC, which, according to them,\nprohibited amendments, modifications, variations or even having the PSC\nsupplemented in any respect without the parties agreeing to it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">51.7 Therefore, the submission advanced was that respondent No.1/GOI\ncould not abuse its position as a sovereign and unilaterally amend the terms\nof the contract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">51.8 In support of its principal argument that extension of tenure of the\nPSC had to occur on the subsisting terms and conditions, it was argued that\nsuch an approach, if adopted, would impart business efficacy to the PSC. It\nwas contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that based on the PSC, they\nhad irreversibly altered their position and, therefore, the respondents could\nnot change their position at this juncture as it would adversely affect their\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 30 of 56</span>\n interest. In this behalf, petitioners sought to rely upon the doctrine of\npromissory estoppels and legitimate expectation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">51.9 Furthermore, it was contended that certainty was the bulwark of such\nlike contracts, and, therefore, the State like any other prudent businessmen\nshould adhere to its commitment and honour its obligations. Reference was\nalso made to the fact that respondent No.1/GOI was committed to creating\nan atmosphere of „ease of doing business‟ in the country and, thus,\nconsistent with that principle, it should extend the tenure of the contract as\nit was in sync with the principles of good governance, stability and\nconsistency.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">51.10 The petitioners also adverted to the fact that <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC\ncould not be linked to the area under the commercial production qua\nnatural gas. It was stated that the extension was mandatory, if commercial\nproduction of natural gas was expected to continue beyond the term of the\nPSC--which, according to the petitioners, was the relevant consideration\nrather than the surface/on-ground area. For this purpose, reliance was\nplaced on the affidavit dated 19.09.2017 filed on behalf of respondent\nNo.1/GOI, wherein, while recognizing the fact that commercial production\nof natural gas had occurred, it was stated that it was confined to a smaller\narea.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">52.     Furthermore, the petitioners contend that revenue maximization\ncannot be the sole or overriding objective of respondent No.1/GOI. For\nthis purpose, reference was made to the judgment of the Constitution\nBench of the Supreme Court in Special Reference No.1/2012 (2012) 10\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 31 of 56</span>\n SCC 1.

On behalf of respondents No. 1 &amp; 2, it was contended that the writ\npetition need not proceed further as respondent No.1/GOI had taken a\ndecision in the matter. In other words since a decision had been taken by\nrespondent No.1/GOI, which, had been conveyed to the petitioners, nothing\nwould survive in the instant writ petition. For this purpose, reliance was\nplaced not only on the New policy, but also, on the subsequent\ncommunication dated 12.04.2017, whereby, the petitioners were called\nupon to apply under the New policy. In support of this submission, as\nindicated above, reliance was placed on behalf of respondents No. 1 &amp; 2 on\nthe observations made by the Court at the time of issuing notice via its\norder dated 14.12.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_111\">53.1 Besides this, it was contended that since the dispute fell within the\nrealm of a contract, this Court ought not entertain the writ petition. The\nemphasis was, on the fact that since the dispute raised was in the realm of\ncontract remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution was not warranted.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                          Page 32 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\"> Furthermore, it was submitted that <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC clearly indicated\nthat the tenure of the contract was only up to 14.05.2020 and that beyond\nthis period, extension can be granted based only on &#x27;mutual agreement&#x27;\narrived at between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">53.2 In this context, it was stated the fact that a New Policy had been\napproved and a framework had been provided for grant of extension qua all\nPre-NELP PSCs, the extension could take place based only on what was\nprovided in the said policy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">53.3 It was, thus, emphasized that as communicated by respondent\nNo.1/GOI in its letter dated 12.04.2017, the contractors would have to\nsubmit a formal application for seeking approval of extension of tenure of\nthe PSC. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"194644453\" id=\"span_37\">In support of submissions made on behalf of respondent No.1 and\n2, reliance was placed on the following judgments: <a href=\"/doc/194644453/\" id=\"a_30\">Arun Kumar Aggarwal\nVs.

On behalf of respondent No.3, it was argued that since the New\npolicy had come into play, the reliance placed by the petitioners on <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_32\">Article\n2.1</a> of the PSC was meaningless as the extension was to be granted on\nmutually agreed terms. It was submitted that in the absence of the Policy\nfor extension of pre-NELP exploratory block PSC, respondent No.3 had\nagreed for extension on the subsisting terms and conditions, which was\nconveyed vide communication dated 08.07.2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_116\">54.1 According to respondent no.3, this position had undergone a change\nwith the New policy coming into force on 07.04.2017.

Crucially, the representative of respondent No.3, in\nresponse, gave a cogent answer, which was, that respondent no.3 had not\nonly sought a legal opinion from an outside legal expert but had also\nexamined the commercials, and thereafter, reached a considered decision\nthat the tenure of the PSC had to be extended and that too on subsisting\nterms and conditions.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                             Page 35 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\"> 57.   Clearly, the stand of respondent No.1 that it wanted a higher share of\npetroleum profits got articulated at the joint meeting held on 18.06.2015.\nThereafter, there was back and forth on the technical and financial\ninformation sought by respondent No.2 from petitioner No. 1/respondent\nNo.3. The details of how correspondence was exchanged on this aspect, has\nbeen dealt in detail, by me, while narrating the facts of the case. Therefore,\ndespite the fact that respondent no.3 had conveyed its decision to\nrespondent No.1, not once, but on two occasions, that the tenure of the PSC\nhad to be extended on the same terms and conditions, an attempt was made\nto delay the final decision by seeking information with regard to additional\ninvestments, which would be required to be made for the extended period\nof the PSC and the benefit that would accrue thereof in terms of the\nproduction of oil and gas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">58.   It was in the background of these facts and circumstances that the\npetitioners approached this Court by way of the instant writ petition. As\nalluded to above, while narrating the factual scenario that it was only upon\nthe Court nudging respondent No.1 and respondent No.3 to move in the\nmatter that a decision was taken qua extension of tenure of the PSC. While\nthe matter was in Court, on 08.07.2016, respondent No.3 conveyed to\nrespondent No.1/GOI that its Board of Directors had taken a decision to\nseek extension of the PSC on the subsisting terms and conditions on\n8.7.2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">59.   It was only, thereafter, that this aspect of the matter got reflected in\nthe proceedings of the Court held on 07.11.2016. The relevant parts of the\nsaid order have been extracted hereinabove by me..\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 36 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\"> 59.1 A close perusal of order dated 07.11.2016 would show that even\nthough respondent No.1/GOI conveyed to the Court that it was in the\nprocess of framing policy guidelines for extension of the Pre-NELP PSCs,\nthe Court made it clear that respondent no.1/ GOI could not link its policy\nguidelines with its decision in the matter as that was not contemplated by\nthe order of 14.12.2015. Accordingly, the Court on 07.11.2016 gave time\ntill 06.01.2017 to respondent No.1/GOI to comply with the order dated\n14.12.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">59.2 Respondent No.1, concededly, did not chose to challenge, either the\ndirections contained in the order dated 14.12.2015 or, those which were\ncontained in the order dated 07.11.2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">60.      Despite the aforesaid situation obtaining, respondent No.1/GOI\nsprung upon the petitioners, the New Policy which was framed on\n07.04.2018 and consequent thereto, told the petitioners via letter dated\n12.04.2017 to apply under the New policy for seeking extension of the\nPSC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_127\">61.      Given this foreground, the issues which, to my mind, arise for\n\nconsideration are as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">Issues\n\nI.       Did the order dated 14.12.2015, passed by this Court, foreclose a\n\nfinal examination by the Court as to whether a remedy by way of a writ is\n\nmaintainable in the facts and circumstances of this case?\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                         Page 37 of 56</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\"> II.

If the answers to issues No. I &amp; II are in the affirmative, can the\n\npetitioners seek extension of the existing tenure of the PSC beyond\n\n14.05.2020 i.e. till 14.05.2030 unimpeded by the fact that a New Policy has\n\ncome into play?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">IV.    What is the scope and effect of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 2.1</a>, which obtains in the PSC\n\nin issue?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">V.     If <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 2.1</a> entitles the petitioners to extension of tenure of the\n\nPSC, is the refusal to extend the tenure by the respondents arbitrary and\n\nunfair?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">Issue No. I\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">62.    A careful perusal of the order dated 14.12.2015 would show that the\nCourt had not foreclosed the issue with regard to whether or not in the\ninstant case, a remedy by way of writ would be available to the petitioners.\nThe observations made were tentative in nature.          The Court, at that\njuncture, was of the view that notwithstanding the objections taken qua the\nmaintainability of a writ, the procrastination displayed by the respondents\nqua the issue of extension of tenure of the PSC, necessitated its intercession\nin the matter. The idea was to nudge the respondents to take a call in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 38 of 56</span>\n matter in terms of its obligation under PSC. At that stage, clearly, the legal\ntenability of a wrong call could not have been tested.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">62.1 Therefore, the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents, in\nparticular, respondent No.1/GOI, that since a decision had been taken, the\nwrit petition had worked itself out and consequently, rendered infructuous,\nto my mind, is a submission which is completely unsustainable. In any\nevent, in my view, the order dated 14.12.2015 was only an interim order\nwhich could not have precluded further arguments that the petitioners\nwould have wanted to advance in the matter. In fact, right from inception,\nthe stand of the petitioners has been, (given the construct of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 2.1</a> of\nthe PSC) that the respondents have no choice but to extend the tenure for\nthe PSC for another 10 years, once, the stage of commercial production of\ngas is reached. Further, there are no such observations in the order which\nwould prevent examination of the issue, that is, whether or not a writ\npetition would lie in matter of like nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">Issue No. II\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">63.   The answer to this question would be in the affirmative, only if one\nwere to come to the conclusion that though the dispute is in the realm of a\ncontractual field, the State has acted in a manner which is arbitrary,\nunreasonable and unfair manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_44\">63.1 Before I proceed further, I may advert to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_36\">ABL International Ltd.

It is really the nature of its personality as\n                   State which is significant and must characterize all\n                   its actions, in whatever field, and not the nature of\n                   function, contractual or otherwise which is decisive\n                   of the nature of scrutiny permitted for examining\n                   the validity of its act. The requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 14</a>\n                   being the duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably,\n                   there is nothing which militates against the concept\n                   of requiring the State always to so act, even in\n                   contractual matters.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">             23     It is clear from the above observations of this\n             Court, once State or an instrumentality of State is a party\n             to the contract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly,\n             justly and reasonably which is the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_53\">Article\n             14</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by the\n             impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants the\n             first respondent as an instrumentality of the State has\n             acted in contravention of the above said requirement of\n             <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 14</a>, then we have no hesitation that a writ court\n             can issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary\n             actions of the first respondent. In this context, we may\n             note that though the first respondent is a company\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                             Page 44 of 56</span>\n              registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_55\">Companies Act</a>, it is wholly owned\n             by the Government of India. The total subscribed share\n             capital of this company is 2,50,000 shares out of which\n             2,49,998 shares are held by the President of India while\n             one each share is held by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of\n             Commerce and Industry and Officer on Special Duty,\n             Ministry of Commerce and Industry respectively. The\n             objects enumerated in the Memorandum of Association of\n             the first respondent at Para 10 read:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">                   &quot;To undertake such functions as may be entrusted\n                   to it by Government from time to time, including\n                   grant of credits and guarantees in foreign currency\n                   for the purpose of facilitating the import of raw\n                   materials and semi-finished goods for manufacture\n                   or processing goods for export.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">      Para 11 of the said object reads thus :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">                    &quot;To act as agent of the Government, or with the\n                    sanction of the Government on its own account, to\n                    give    the      guarantees,   undertake    such\n                    responsibilities and discharge such functions as\n                    are considered by the Government as necessary in\n                    national interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">             24     It is clear from the above two objects of the\n             company that apart from the fact that the company is\n             wholly a Government owned company, it discharges the\n             functions of the Government and acts as an agent of the\n             Government even when it gives guarantees and it has a\n             responsibility to discharge such functions in the national\n             interest. In this background it will be futile to contend\n             that the actions of the first respondent impugned in the\n             writ petition do not have a touch of public function or\n             discharge of a public duty.

From the above discussion of ours, the following\n              legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ\n              petition :-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">                     (a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as\n                     against a State or an instrumentality of a State\n                     arising out of a contractual obligation is\n                     maintainable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">                     (b) Merely because some disputed questions of\n                     facts arise for consideration, same cannot be a\n                     ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all\n                     cases as a matter of rule.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">                     (c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief\n                     of monetary claim is also maintainable... &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">                                                      (emphasis is mine)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">64.    Therefore, if the aforesaid indices are applied to the facts of this\ncase, one cannot but come to the conclusion that a writ petition would lie.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">65.    Thus, the principles which emerge upon consideration of the\njudgment in ABL and Kumar Shrilesh Vidyarathi qua the aspect which\narises in this case are:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">(i)    Firstly, it is nature of the respondents‟ personality which is\nsignificant and not the nature of its function, which could be contractual or\notherwise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">(ii)   Second, the State does not shed its personality just because it enters\nthe contractual arena.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 46 of 56</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\"> (iii)   Third, there is nothing in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 14</a> which indicates that the State\nand/or its instrumentality need not act reasonably or fairly or sans\narbitrariness, when it operates in the contractual field.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">66.     The distinction drawn earlier by the Supreme Court that a writ\nagainst a State would lie only prior to the firming up of a contract and not\nthereafter, has been done away after it rendered the judgment in the matter\nof Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi Etc. vs State Of U.P. And Ors., (1991) 1\nSCC 212.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">66.1 In the instant case, the aforementioned principles would apply with\ngreater force as there is an element of a public law involved in the subject\ntransaction.    Therefore, whether one applies the narrower Kumar\nShrilekha Vidyarathi test or the braoder ABL test, a writ petition would lie\nin the instant case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_57\">66.2 Thus, as in the <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_58\">ABL</a> case, there is a contract in subsistence i.e. the\nPSC. The PSC is executed between a private party and a State. The fact\nthat it deals with the natural resources is not in dispute. Furthermore, the\nfact that the extension of the contract would impact public interest is also\nnot in doubt. The contract involves exploration of gas and oil over which\nthe State has complete control for the reason that slightest error could have\nexponential impact on the country‟s economy. Therefore, to contend that\nno public law element is involved, in my view, is a contention which\ncannot be accepted.      This apart, the allegation that there is manifest\narbitrariness in the respondents refusing to extend the tenure of the PSC\nleaves doubt in my mind that the action is amenable to writ jurisdiction of\nthis Court.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 47 of 56</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\"> 67.   Given these facets, what, I am required to examine is whether\nrespondent No.1/GOI in this case is acting unfairly and/or arbitrarily in\ndenying extension under <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC to the petitioners. In other\nwords, is there a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">67.1 This part of the inquiry will be made by me, while discussing issue\nNo. III &amp; IV. Suffice it to say that so far as issue No. II is concerned, a\nremedy by way of a writ petition would lie. Before I conclude my view, on\nthis issue, I may also refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Joshi\nTechnologies International Inc, wherein, once again, the Supreme Court\nhas considered the entire gamut of case law on the issue including the\ndecision in ABL.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_165\">67.2 In that case, the Court was called upon to consider as to whether the\ndeduction under <a href=\"/doc/1627329/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 42</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short „<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_62\">IT Act</a>‟)\nwould be available to the appellant. The contract arrived at between the\nappellant and the State, it appears, inadvertently or otherwise, did not make\na reference to that aspect of the matter. The appellant, in fact, in the\nassessment years prior to 2005-2006 had obtained deduction under <a href=\"/doc/1627329/\" id=\"a_63\">Section\n42</a> of the I.T. Act till it was pointed out that necessary ingredients in that\nbehalf were not incorporated in the agreement entered into between the\nappellant and the respondent. Unfortunately, even though, the Ministry of\nPetroleum and Natural Gas supported the case of the appellant, the\nMinistry of Finance did not issue the necessary clarification, vis-à-vis, the\ncontract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">67.3 The Supreme Court denied relief to the appellant <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_64\">in that case</a>,\nprincipally, on the ground, that in order to obtain a deduction under Section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                           Page 48 of 56</span>\n 42 of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_65\">I.T. Act</a>, a clear stipulation in that behalf had to be provided in the\ncontract as these were special allowances, which otherwise were not\navailable, since the expenses incurred resulted in bringing into the\nexistence assets of enduring nature or, were in the nature of initial\nexpenditure which set the profit earning machinery in motion. In other\nwords, but for <a href=\"/doc/1627329/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 42</a> under ordinary principles of income tax law\nallowances claimed would not have been available as they were in the\nnature of capital expenditure. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_60\">What is important, though, is that, the\nSupreme Court in paragraphs 68, 69 &amp; 70 had made the following\nobservations while citing with approval the <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_67\">ABL</a> case:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      &quot;68. The Court thereafter summarized the legal position in the\n      following manner:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">             &quot;27. From the above discussion of ours, following legal\n             principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition\n             :-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">                    (a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as\n                    against a State or an instrumentality of a State\n                    arising out of a contractual obligation is\n                    maintainable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">                    (b) Merely because some disputed questions of\n                    facts arise for consideration, same cannot be a\n                    ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all\n                    cases as a matter of rule.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">                    (c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief\n                    of monetary claim is also maintainable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172383107\" id=\"span_61\">28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the\n             maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 226</a> of the\n             Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                              Page 49 of 56</span>\n              fact that the power to issue prerogative writs\n             under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is plenary in nature\n             and is not limited by any other provisions of the\n             Constitution. The High Court having regard to the facts\n             of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to\n             entertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon\n             itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power\n             (See: <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_70\">Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade\n             Marks</a>,). And this plenary right of the High Court to issue\n             a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the\n             Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless\n             such action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary\n             and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional\n             mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 14</a> or for other valid and legitimate\n             reasons, for which the court thinks it necessary to\n             exercise the said jurisdiction.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">      69. The position thus summarized in the aforesaid principles\n      has to be understood in the context of discussion that preceded\n      which we have pointed out above. As per this, no doubt, there is\n      no absolute bar to the maintainability of the writ petition even\n      in contractual matters or where there are disputed questions of\n      fact or even when monetary claim is raised. At the same time,\n      discretion lies with the High Court which under certain\n      circumstances, can refuse to exercise. It also follows that under\n      the following circumstances, &#x27;normally&#x27;, the Court would not\n      exercise such a discretion:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">      69.1 The Court may not examine the issue unless the action has\n      some public law character attached to it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">      69.2 Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute is\n      provided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to\n      exercise its discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and\n      relegate the party to the said mode of settlement, particularly\n      when settlement of disputes is to be resorted to through the\n      means of arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 50 of 56</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">       69.3 If there are very serious disputed questions of fact which\n      are of complex nature and require oral evidence for their\n      determination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">      69.4 Money claims per se particularly arising out of\n      contractual obligations are normally not to be entertained\n      except in exceptional circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">      70     Further legal position which emerges from various\n      judgments of this Court dealing with different situations/aspects\n      relating to the contracts entered into by the State/public\n      Authority with private parties, can be summarized as under:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">      70.1 At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts\n      purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations\n      of fairness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">      70.2 State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual\n      field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practice some\n      discriminations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">      70.3 Even in cases where question is of choice or consideration\n      of competing claims before entering into the field of contract,\n      facts have to be investigated and found before the question of a\n      violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution could arise. If those\n      facts are disputed and require assessment of evidence the\n      correctness of which can only be tested satisfactorily by taking\n      detailed evidence, involving examination and cross-\n      examination of witnesses, the case could not be conveniently or\n      satisfactorily decided in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a> of the\n      Constitution. In such cases court can direct the aggrieved party\n      to resort to alternate remedy of civil suit etc.\n\n      70.9 The distinction between public law and private law\n      element in the contract with State is getting blurred. However,\n      it has not been totally obliterated and where the matter falls\n      purely in private field of contract, this Court has maintained the\n      position that writ petition is not maintainable.

In fact, each case has to be\n      examined, on its facts whether the contractual relations\n      between the parties bear insignia of public element. Once on\n      the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of the\n      activity or controversy involves public law element, then the\n      matter can be examined by the High Court in writ petitions\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to see whether\n      action of the State and/or instrumentality or agency of the State\n      is fair, just and equitable or that relevant factors are taken into\n      consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone into the\n      decision making process or that the decision is not arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_171\">      70.10 Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen,\n      in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable\n      right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may\n      render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirements\n      of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of\n      the principle of non-arbitrariness.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">                                                      (emphasis is mine)\n\n67.4.

This is the first part of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 2.1.</a>\n68.1 The second part of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 2.1</a> which is contained in the proviso to\nthe first part incorporates a situation, which is that, if the event adverted\ntherein i.e., Commercial Production of Natural Gas, were to take place and\nthat event was expected to continue beyond the initial term of the contract,\nthen, the contract was mandatorily required to be extended for a further\nperiod, though not exceeding thirty five (35) years from the effective date.\nTo this part, a limb, in a manner of speech, has been added which provides\nthat there should mutual agreement between the parties, sufficient to permit\nthe contractor to maximize production of natural gas in accordance with the\ngood petroleum practice. The mandatoriness qua extension in this part is\nspelled out from the use of the expression &quot;shall&quot;.\n68.2 The last part of Article envisages that if the production of crude oil\nor the natural gas is expected to continue beyond the end of the relevant\nperiod <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_81\">referred to above</a>, the party &#x27;may‟ agree to extend the contract for a\nfurther period upon such terms as they may mutually agree.\n68.3 Therefore, as alluded to above, <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 2.1</a>, broadly, has three parts to\nit. The first part encapsulates the initial term which is to run for twenty five\n(25) years unless an early termination brings the contract to an end. This\npart also provides that the contract could be extended for a further period of\nfive (5) years, based on mutual agreement arrived at between the parties.\nThe use of the word &#x27;may&#x27; gives leverage to the parties qua the aspect of the\nextension of the contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_175\">68.4 The second part of the contract gets triggered, once, commercial\nproduction of the gas takes place and the production is expected to continue\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                              Page 53 of 56</span>\n beyond the end of the term of the contract. In such a situation, the Article\nenvisages mandatory extension of the contract for a period upto but not\nexceeding thirty five (35) years. This aspect gets emphasized by the use of\nthe term &#x27;shall&#x27;. There is an element of mutuality provided to the extension\nto the extent that the extension should be sufficient to permit the contractor\nto maximize production of natural gas in accordance with good petroleum\nindustry practice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_176\">68.5 The last part of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 2.1</a>, to my mind, is open ended inasmuch as\nafter thirty five (35) year period is over, if the production of crude oil or\nnatural gas is expected to continue beyond the said period, the parties are at\nliberty to extend the contract on mutually agreed terms. In this part, the\nterm &#x27;may&#x27; is used, in a sense, as a suffix, both in respect of the decision to\nbe taken, that is, as to whether or not the contract should be extended, and\nalso, as to the terms on which extension is to be made.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_177\">69.   In the instant case, there is, as indicated above, no dispute that\ncommercial production of natural gas has taken place and that the MC\nwhich also comprised of the representatives of respondent No.1 and\nrespondent No.2 have come to a conclusion that its production is expected\nto extend to further period of ten years i.e. till 2030. If that be the situation,\nthen, to my mind, the contract, as contended by the petitioners, is\nmandatorily required to be extended for a period of ten (10) years beyond\nthe current tenure of the PSC.        The argument advanced on behalf of\nrespondent No.1/GOI that it cannot be on the same terms and conditions\nwould have to be repelled as mutuality which is envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 2.1</a> is\nto be such that permits the contractor to maximize production of natural gas\nin accordance with the good petroleum industry practice. The intent,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                               Page 54 of 56</span>\n evidently, was that the oil and natural gas contracts need a long terms\nperspective since investments are heavy and, therefore, once an expectation\nis created, based on the verifiable data, then, the terms and conditions of\nengagement ought not be changed qua the extended period. The fact that\nthere is a reference to good petroleum industry practice, only fortifies this\nview.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">69.1 CII in its representation brought to fore this view generally for the\nbenefit of all pre-NELP PSC Contractors. Certainty is the hallmark of\ngood petroleum practice. I may also indicate herein that the petitioners are\nright in their contention that the subject PSC is different from the Model\npre-NELP PSC inasmuch as the wordings contained in the proviso to the\nModel <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 2.1</a> are clearly different from those obtaining in the\ncorresponding article in the PSC in issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">70.     Therefore, having regard to the aforesaid, I am of the view that the\npetitioners are right in contending that they are entitled to the extension of\nthe tenure of the PSC in issue. The contra argument of the respondents that\nsince the New policy has come into play, the extension, can only be on the\nterms stipulated therein, according to me, is without merit for two reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">(i) First, the New Policy cannot be used to repudiate the plain terms of the\ncontract to the detriment of the petitioners. The execution of the PSC\noccurred prior to formulation of the New Policy. The New Policy was\nfirmed up and notified during the pendency of the writ petition. The New\nPolicy, therefore, cannot govern the terms of the PSC. (ii) Second, despite\nthe fact the Court in its order dated 07.11.2016 had observed that the\nrespondents&#x27; decision with respect to extension could not be linked to any\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                            Page 55 of 56</span>\n policy guidelines, the respondents have attempted to do exactly the\nopposite without assailing the orders of this Court.\n70.1 Therefore, answer to all three issues has to be in favour of the\npetitioners and against the respondents. The petitioners are not only entitled\nto seek an extension, as indicated hereinabove, by me, but would be\nentitled to the same, based on the existing terms and conditions, that is,\ndehors the terms stipulated in the New Policy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_181\">70.2 Given the circumstances, as discussed above, which, show that the\npetitioners fall within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 2.1</a>, the refusal by the\nrespondents to extend the tenure is both arbitrary and unfair; hence,\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">71.   Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the writ petition is allowed.\nRespondent No.1/GOI will extend the PSC dated 15.05.1995, pertaining to\nthe Rajasthan Block, for a period of 10 years beyond its current term i.e. till\n14.05.2030 as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 2.1</a> of the PSC, on the same terms and\nconditions. Since, the decision of the Board of Directors of respondent\nNo.3, taken at its meeting held on 28.12.2017, was arrived at, in the\nbackdrop of the New Policy being notified, the same would be disregarded.\nRespondent No.3&#x27;s earlier decision dated 08.07.2016 will hold the field.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_183\">72.   Thus, respondent No.1/GOI will convey its decision, formally, to the\npetitioners, within two weeks of the date of the receipt of a copy of the\norder. No costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">                                               RAJIV SHAKDHER\n                                                   (JUDGE)\nMAY 31, 2018\nCks/A\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">W.P.(C) No. 11599/2015                                             Page 56 of 56</span>\n </p>","numcites":18,"numcitedby":2,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":154155167,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"LEGITIMATE EXPECTATION","formInput":"LEGITIMATE%20EXPECTATION"},{"value":"public function","formInput":"public%20function"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"maxim","formInput":"maxim"},{"value":"public duty","formInput":"public%20duty"},{"value":"ecgc","formInput":"ecgc"},{"value":"consequential relief","formInput":"consequential%20relief"},{"value":"contractual obligations","formInput":"contractual%20obligations"},{"value":"2020  filter:  beneficial interest beneficial nominee nominee under insurance","formInput":"2020%20%20filter%3A%20%20beneficial%20interest%20beneficial%20nominee%20nominee%20under%20insurance"},{"value":"ONGC","formInput":"ONGC"},{"value":"what is commercial production","formInput":"what%20is%20commercial%20production"},{"value":" contract was extended from","formInput":"%20contract%20was%20extended%20from"},{"value":" FDP","formInput":"%20FDP"},{"value":"writ petition under article 226","formInput":"writ%20petition%20under%20article%20226"},{"value":"Instrumentality of state","formInput":"Instrumentality%20of%20state"},{"value":"participating interest","formInput":"participating%20interest"},{"value":"mutual","formInput":"mutual"},{"value":"interlocutory application","formInput":"interlocutory%20application"},{"value":"mutual agreement","formInput":"mutual%20agreement"},{"value":"crude oil","formInput":"crude%20oil"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
