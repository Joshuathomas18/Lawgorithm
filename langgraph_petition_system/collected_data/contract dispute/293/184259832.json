From the details furnished by the assessee, the AO noted that the assessee\n\nhas entered into three contracts with NHPC on 6th December, 2001. Contract-1 is\n\nin respect of offshore supplies, Contract-2 is in respect of onshore supplies and\n\nContract-3 is in respect of onshore services. He, therefore, asked the assessee to\n\nexplain as to why the revenues from offshore supplies under the first contract\n\nshould not be attributed to the project office of the assessee in India and taxed in\n\naccordance with the various provisions of the Act read with the relevant provisions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                         4</span>\n                                                       ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                            ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nof the DTAA entered into between India and Japan. He also asked the assessee to\n\nexplain as to why the revenues from third contract i.e., &#x27;Provision of onshore\n\nservices&#x27; should not be treated as &#x27;Fees for technical services&#x27; in terms of <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_2\">section\n\n9(1)(viii)</a> of the provisions of the relevant DTAA and taxed in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/180933840/\" id=\"a_3\">section 44D</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/892668/\" id=\"a_4\">section 115</a> of the IT Act.\n\n7.1   The assessee made a detailed submission explaining as to why such offshore\n\nsupplies should not be attributed to the project office in India. However, the AO\n\nwas not satisfied with the arguments advanced by the assessee and held that on\n\nreading of <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_5\">section 44BBB</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1954990/\" id=\"a_6\">10</a>% of the amount paid or payable whether in or\n\noutside India to the assessee or any person on his behalf on account such civil\n\nconstruction, erection, testing or commissioning shall be deemed to be the income\n\nchargeable to tax under the head &#x27;Profit and gains from business or profession.&#x27;\n\nAccordingly, the income received for offshore supplies in respect of Teesta and\n\nPurulia projects are chargeable to tax @ 10%. He further held that everything\n\ndirectly or indirectly relating to the said business should be considered under the\n\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_7\">section 44BBB</a> of the Act. He accordingly concluded that income for the\n\npurpose of this section should also include offshore receipts for the supply of\n\nequipment. He noted that the assessee is engaged in offshore supplies as well as\n\nonshore supplies in respect of Teesta and Purulia projects. It is also engaged in the\n\ninstallation and commissioning of such equipments supplied. The submission of\n\nthe assessee that offshore supplies are made by the HO i.e., Mitsui &amp; Co.

He examined the various clauses of the contract and came to the\n\nconclusion that the assessee is receiving consideration from their employers i.e.,\n\nNHPC and WBSEB for the execution of the projects. A part of such consideration\n\nis in foreign currency and the balance is in INR. Therefore, according to the AO,\n\nthe assessee has a business connection in India<a href=\"/doc/1220884/\" id=\"a_8\"> u/s 9(1)(i)</a> of the Act. The AO\n\nfurther examined the existence of a PE in India within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 5</a> of\n\nthe Indo-Japan DTAA. According to the AO, the assessee has not denied that it\n\ndoes not have any PE in India.        The project office of the assessee in India,\n\naccording to the AO constitutes a PE in India under <a href=\"/doc/1188180/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 5(2)</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 5(1)</a> of\n\nthe DTAA. Further, the assessee has also a PE in India under <a href=\"/doc/507956/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 5(3)</a> of the\n\nDTAA as it is engaged in installation project which has exceeded the duration of\n\nsix months. He rejected various explanations given by the assessee and observed\n\nthat in the immediately preceding assessment year, identical issue was involved\n\nwhere it has been held that LO&#x27;s of the assessee in India constitutes fixed PE under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 5(1)</a><a href=\"/doc/1986509/\" id=\"a_14\">, 5(2)(c)</a> of the DTAA and Dependent Agency Permanent\n\nEstablishment (DAPE) under <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 5(7)</a> of the DTAA as the LO excises the\n\nauthority to conclude contracts and secure orders in India wholly for the assessee.\n\nIt was further held in the said assessment year, as an alternative stand that Mitsui &amp;\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                          6</span>\n                                                       ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                            ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nCo. India Pvt. Ltd. (MIPL) also constitutes DAPE of the assessee under <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_16\">Article\n\n5(7)</a> of the DTAA. However, the A.O. adopted the figure extracted from sales of\n\nLO to arrive at the taxable income under this head for the A.Y. 2005-06.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">8.    Since the facts of both these assessment years i.e. A.Y 2005-06 and the\n\npresent assessment year are same, the AO held that the LOs of the assessee in India\n\nconstitute fixed PE in India under <a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_17\">Articles 5(1)</a><a href=\"/doc/1986509/\" id=\"a_18\">, 5(2)(c)</a> of the DTAA and DAPE\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_19\">article 5(7)</a> of the DTAA as has been held in A.Y 2005-06. Further,\n\nalternatively MIPL also constitutes DAPE of the assessee as has been held in A.Y\n\n2005-06. Further, alternatively MIPL also constitutes DAPE of the assessee as has\n\nbeen held in A.Y. 2005-06. For the purposes of arriving at the profits attributable\n\nto Indian Operations, combined figures of LOs and MIPL were adopted.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">9.    The assessee was asked to furnish the details of the sales made through the\n\nLOs in India. The assessee furnished the details and also took the plea that the\n\noffshore supplies in respect of the Teesta &amp; Purulia projects have also been\n\nincluded in such sales through LOs in India. The AO asked the assessee vide letter\n\ndated 26.12.2008, to substantiate its claim. However, the assessee could not\n\nprovide any documentary evidence so as to prove that the offshore supplies in\n\nrespect of Teesta &amp; Purulia Projects are already included in the turnover of the LO.\n\nTherefore, the AO held that no benefit can be given to the assessee on this ground.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                         7</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">                                                                       ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                                            ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">10.

As can be seen from the memorandum of the Finance Bill,\n      1989 the legislative intent behind the introduction of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_22\">section 44BB</a> was\n      simplification in the matter of determination of the income accruing or arising\n      in India to a foreign company which often involved complications. As held by\n      the Hon&#x27;ble ITAT, Delhi Bench in case of Saipem S.P.A.vs DCIT(supra), the\n      provision of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 44BB</a> were intended only to replace the system of\n      computation of income earlier envisaged by the application of the provision of\n      <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 28</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1543897/\" id=\"a_25\">41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/394567/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections 43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/32503/\" id=\"a_27\">43 A </a>of the Act. It was not to replace\n      the provision of <a href=\"/doc/65305/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 5</a> of the Act, which would remain intact and was not\n      to be superceded by the provision of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_29\">section 44BB</a>. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_30\">section\n      44BBB</a> are para- materia with the provision of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_31\">section 44BB</a>.

The\ncontract was divisible into two types of operations, one being fabrication in\nKorea and other of installation in India. The main question was whether\nprofits accruing to the assessee from activities performed outside India were\nchargeable to tax in India. After a detailed discussion the Apex Court held that\nthe profits that accrued to the Korean Enterprise for the Korean operations was\nnot taxable in India. Another question was with regard to the quantum of\nprofits embedded in the Indian operations.

Under the said instruction, in cases where the sales\n     take place outside, as in this case, only 10 per cent of the gross\n     receipts in respect of the activities of installation, commissioning\n     etc. performed in India will be taxable. In view of the stand taken\n     by the assessee, we are of the view that the Commissioner of\n     Income-tax (Appeals) was right in computing the taxable profits at\n     10 per cent of the gross receipts in respect of the activities of\n     installation, commissioning etc. performed in India....\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">     15.

The same shall be taxable\n     accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">The Court examined the provision of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 44BB</a>, which like <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n44BBB</a>, was also the provision for computation of income on presumptive\nbasis. The ratio which emerges from this judgement is that <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 44BB</a>\ncannot be interpreted to mean that once the income is computed on the\npresumptive basis, as envisaged under this section, all the receipts, even\nthough they may not be taxable in India, would be included for computing\nincome on presumptive basis. This is clear from the finding given in paras\n15(a) and 15(b) above. The income from operations outside India has been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                       10</span>\n                                                            ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                                 ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\n      held to be non-taxable (as per para 15 (a)} and income only from operations\n      attributable to Indian Permanent establishment has been held to be taxable in\n      India @ 10% on presumptive basis {as per para 15(b)}. Thus, the offshore\n      receipts in the present case cannot be subjected to tax merely on the ground\n      that the appellant has chosen to be assessed on presumptive basis. The\n      question whether such receipts will be taxable in India will have to be\n      considered independently on their own merits which is the subject matter of\n      separate arguments which follow hereinafter. It is, therefore held that the AO\n      was not justified in holding that <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 44BBB</a> requires that the offshore\n      receipts have necessarily to be taxed in India. As a result, Ground of appeal\n      No. 1 &amp; 1.1 are allowed granting relief of Rs.23,91,98,358/-.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">13.

Clause 31.1 of\n      the contract with NHPC unequivocally clarifies that the title of properties in\n      the goods was transferred outside India as soon as the goods were loaded in\n      the ship and the shipping documents were handed over to the nominated bank.\n      There are no other terms in the contract which were inconsistent with clause\n      31.1 which describes the event of delivery. The sale was completed outside\n      India and the income thus accrued outside India. The Permanent\n      Establishment had not played any part in the offshore supply of the\n      equipments. Although entire consideration was not paid on delivery of\n      equipment such non-payment did not prevent the transfer of goods.

The\nscope of work of offshore and onshore contracts were separate. On a proper\nanalysis of the salient features of the contract, as explained in the written\nsubmissions, none of the reasons contained in para 6 of the assessment order\nin respect of the NHPC contracts contradict the proposition that income from\noffshore supply was not taxable in India. The reasoning given in clause (vii) of\npara 6 also does not advance the case of the AO, so long as particular material\nwas supplied outside India and the delivery thereof has been taken outside\nIndia.

However, the facts for the present A.Y. 2006-07\n\nand onwards are different from the facts of the case upto 2005-06.

Thus, Interest free advance\n(10%) will be reduced in proportion to the value of the plant &amp; equipment\ndelivered to the site as evidenced by delivery documents. [AO, p.25]\nSimilarly, major part of the value of offshore supplies (65%) shall be\npayableon delivery of the goods at the site. [AO, p.25] Thus, the entire\ncontract is negotiated and executed not on the basis of delivery of supplies\noutside India, but on the context of delivery at the site. It is very clear that\nthe supplier/assessee continues to have control over the equipments while in\ntransit and there is no actual custody of the equipments by the buyer from\nthe supplier outside India. From the clauses referred herein above the\nsupplier is solely responsible for delivery of the equipments to the territory\nof India each time they are loaded on the ship.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">§     It is observed that the assessee is providing with functional\nguarantee towards performance and security.

This implies that the supply is in extremely\n\nlinked/connected to the services rendered by assessee in terms of direction\nof the project.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">■           As per cl.21.4 of the GCC, Contractor shall, at its own\nexpense, handle all imported plant &amp; equipment at       the point(s) of\nimport and shall handle any formalities for custom clearance, [p.123 of PB\n06-07] If the sale of equipment has taken place outside India as claimed by\nthe assessee, then how that assessee is is paying custom duty in India and\ndelivering the same to its project site?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">To sum up, in the light of the above, the purpose for which the tender was\ninvited by NHPC is not in doubt. It was not for supply of offshore\nequipments independent of the installation and commissioning. Nor was it\nfor independent installation and commissioning, divorced from the design\nand supply of the equipments necessary. The presence of features like &#x27;cross-\nbreach clause&#x27; as well as &#x27;consolidated insurance coverage for all the three\ncontracts&#x27; etc. clearly proves that such a contract has necessarily to be read as\na whole and is not capable of being split up. Furthermore, the assessee itself\nclaims that the receipt from the contract is eligible for taxation<a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_88\"> u/s 44BBB</a> of\nthe Act. If, the offshore supply component is divorced from the contract, as\nclaimed by the assessee, the receipts from services cannot be taxed<a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_89\"> u/s\n44BBB</a> of the Act. On reading the contract in the context of the tender\nfloated and the purpose sought to be achieved, the contract involved herein is\na composite contract and it cannot be dissected into parts. Thus, looking at\nand reading the contract as a whole, the Ld. CIT (A) erred in accepting the\nclaim of the assessee that a part of the transaction should be treated as a\ncontract for offshore supply that is not liable to be taxed in India. Thus, for\nthe purpose of taxation, the contract must be taken as one, for installation\nand commissioning of a\nproject in India.

As the permanent establishment cannot be said to be involved\n      in the transaction, the aforementioned provision will have no application. The\n      permanent establishment cannot be equated to a business connection, since the\n      former is for the purpose of assessment of income of a non-resident under a\n      Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, and the latter is for the application\n      of <a href=\"/doc/1369261/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 9</a> of the Income Tax Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">      (6) Clause (a) of Explanation 1 to<a href=\"/doc/1220884/\" id=\"a_95\"> S. 9(1)(i)</a> states that only such part of the\n      income as is attributable to the operations carried out in India, are taxable in\n      India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">      (7) The existence of a permanent establishment would not constitute sufficient\n      &#x27;business connection&#x27;, and the permanent establishment would be the taxable\n      entity.

In\nfact in the present case, onshore services is\nbeing provided under third contract on\nwhich taxes has been paid and there is no\ndispute. It may be relevant to point out that\nin the LG.

Accordingly, the first line of this\nclause 31.4 is meant for onshore supply i.e.\nsupplies from within India under Second\ncontract and not under First contract i.e.\nOffshore supply. This becomes more clear\nwhen we read last line of this clause reads\npage 116 of the contract &quot;provided\nquantity of any plant or equipment\nspecifically stipulated in the contract shall\nbe the property of the employer whether or\nnot incorporated in the facilities.&quot; The first\ncontract is for offshore supplies and\nquantity of plant and equipment has been\nspecifically specified in schedule 1 at page\n36 to page 38 of the contract. Thus,\noffshore supplies cannot be returned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">As regards clause 31.5 regarding the risk\nof loss and damage, the Ld.

Referring to the various clauses of the contract, he submitted that the clauses\n\nare identical to that of the case decided by the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in the\n\ncase of LG Cables and, therefore, the issue stands squarely covered by the decision\n\nof the Hon&#x27;ble Jurisdictional High Court in favour of the assessee. So far as the\n\ndecision relied on by the ld.CIT, DR in the case of <a href=\"/doc/584977/\" id=\"a_116\">Sedco Forex International Inc.</a>\n\n(supra), is concerned, he submitted that the same case was decided on the issue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_117\">section 44BB</a> and not on <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_118\">section 44BBB</a>. As per <a href=\"/doc/180041199/\" id=\"a_119\">section 44BB(1)</a>, a sum equal to\n\n10% of the amount specified in sub-section (2) is deemed to be profit and gains of\n\nsuch business. In sub-section (2), it has been stated that such sum shall include\n\namount paid/payable on account of provision of services and facilities in\n\nconnection with or supply of plant and machinery on hire or to be used in the\n\nprospecting for or extraction of or production of mineral oils in India. Thus, in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_120\">section 44BB</a>, there is specific coverage of the services provided which has to be\n\ntaken into consideration while computing presumptive income under this section.\n\nAs against this, in <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_121\">section 44BBB</a> which is applicable in respect of business of civil\n\nconstruction, the applicability is on the amount paid or payable on account of civil\n\nconstruction, erection, testing or commissioning only. Thus, the amount of both\n\nthe offshore supply is not covered in provisions of <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_122\">section 44BBB</a>. He submitted\n\nthat in the case of the assessee, the third contract entered into by the assessee with\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                         42</span>\n                                                         ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                              ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nNHPC is regarding civil construction, erection, testing or commissioning and on\n\nwhich the assessee has paid taxes under this section. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_123\">section\n\n44BBB</a> are not applicable in respect of offshore supplies. He submitted that, in\n\nfact, the decision relied on by the ld.CIT, DR in the case of Sedco Forex\n\nInternational Inc. supports the case of the assessee wherein at para 47 of the order,\n\nit has been stated: &quot;Thus, where clause (a) mentions the amount which is paid or\n\npayable, clause (b) deal with the amount which are received or deemed to be\n\nreceived in India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"584977\" id=\"span_65\">23.1 He submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/584977/\" id=\"a_124\">the above decision</a> cited\n\n(supra) has held that the amount which is covered in clause (a) only will be within\n\nthe purview of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_125\">section 44BB</a> and not all the payments. Para 42 of the judgment\n\nmakes it clear that it is only certain receipts mentioned in sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_126\">section\n\n44BB</a> which have been taken into account for applying <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_127\">section 44BB</a>.                   He\n\nsubmitted that since, in the instant case, there is no dispute that the receipts\n\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_128\">section 44BBB</a> has been taken into account and tax paid by the\n\nassessee thereon, therefore, the AO has gone wrong in including even those\n\nreceipts which are not covered<a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_129\"> u/s 44BBB</a>. He submitted that in the case of LG\n\nCables Ltd., there were two contracts whereas in the case of the assessee, there\n\nwere three contracts. Further, offshore services means services provided outside\n\nIndia. He submitted that there cannot be any allegation that offshore services have\n\nbeen provided from India. In fact, in the present case, onshore services is being\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                          43</span>\n                                                        ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                             ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nprovided under a third contract in which taxes have been paid by the assessee for\n\nwhich there is no dispute.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"584977\" id=\"span_67\">23.   So far as the terms of payment in the case of LG Cables Ltd., is concerned<a href=\"/doc/584977/\" id=\"a_130\">,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/584977/\" id=\"a_131\">in that case</a></a> 10% was advance payment, 75% was progressive payment and 15%\n\nwas final payment on completion of operational acceptance. Against this, in the\n\ncase of the assessee, it is 10% advance payment, 15% is also advance payment on\n\nprogress of the equipment drawings in the home country, 65% payment is on\n\ndelivery and the balance 10% on completion and operational acceptance. Thus,\n\nthere is no material difference. As regards the basis of price variation/justification\n\nin respect of supplies made, this clause does not change the nature of the contract.\n\nHe submitted that a perusal of the annexure to the contract shows that there is price\n\nadjustment formula for supply of plant and equipment under this contract i.e.,\n\noffshore supply. The contractor having quoted the price on the basis of the price of\n\nmaterial and labour on the date of the tender, a clause has been inserted to make\n\nfurther payment in terms of this formula. For this, all payments were to be made in\n\nforeign currency. It is important to mention that these payments are linked to\n\nshipment of the supply from the country of origin i.e., Japan.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">24.   So far as the method of payment is concerned, he submitted that it is also\n\nsame. The only difference is that in the case of LG Cables Ltd., the payments were\n\nto be made within 30 days whereas in the present case it is to be paid within 60\n\ndays of the submission of the invoice. Further, in the case of LG Cables, there was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                         44</span>\n                                                        ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                             ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\na provision for pro rata payment which means pro rata shipment meaning thereby\n\nall equipments not to be shipped at one go. Similarly, in the present case, there is a\n\nprovision for pro rata payment and sub-packages means that part shipment can be\n\nmade and payment will be received on pro-rata basis. In the case of LG Cables,\n\nthe payment was through irrevocable letter of credit whereas in the case of the\n\nassessee also the payments are through irrevocable letter of credit as per clause 3.0\n\nat page 7 of the agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_109\">24.1 He submitted that there is no difference in the transfer of ownership to the\n\ntitle and risk. The term of transfer of ownership in the case of the assessee is not\n\ndifferent from that of LG Cables Ltd.         Referring to various clauses of the\n\nagreement vis-à-vis the clauses of the agreement of LG Cables Ltd., he submitted\n\nthat both are same, therefore, in view of the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Jurisdictional\n\nHigh Court, the matter being covered in favour of the assessee, the order of the\n\nld.CIT(A) be upheld and ground of appeal No.1 and 2 of the appeal filed by the\n\nRevenue should be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_111\">25.

We have heard the rival arguments made by both the sides, perused the\n\norders of the AO and CIT(A) and the paper book filed on behalf of the assessee.\n\nSo far as grounds of appeal No.1 and 2 are concerned, it is the grievance of the\n\nRevenue that the CIT(A) erred in holding that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_132\">section 44BBB</a> of\n\nthe Act cannot be applied for subjecting to tax the income from offshore supplies\n\nin respect of Teesta and Purulia project and further holding that the income from\n\noffshore supplies in respect of the above two projects were not liable to be taxed\n\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 7</a> r.w. paragraph 6 of the protocol to the DTAA\n\nbetween India and Japan. We find the assessee, in the instant case, is a foreign\n\ncompany incorporated in Japan. It had entered into contracts with NHPC for\n\nTeesta project.   This comprises of three separate contracts: (a) for offshore\n\nsupplies; (b) for onshore supplies; and (c) for onshore services. Similarly, the\n\nassessee has also entered into contracts with WBSEB in respect of Purulia Pumped\n\nStorage Project. This comprises of two contracts, namely, a) for offshore and b)\n\nfor onshore supplies.

It is\n      not in dispute that assessees were assessed under the said provision which is\n      applicable in the instant case. For assessment under this provision, a sum equal\n      to 10% of the aggregate of the amounts specified in sub-section (2) shall be\n      deemed to be the profits and gains of such business chargeable to tax under the\n      head &#x27;profits and gains of the business or profession&#x27;. Subsection (2) mentions\n      two kinds of amounts which shall be deemed as profits and gains of the\n      business chargeable to tax in India. Sub-clause (a) thereof relates to amount\n      paid or payable to the assessee or any person on his behalf on account of\n      provision of services and facilities in connection with, or supply of plant and\n      machinery on hire used, or to be used in the prospecting for, or extraction or\n      production of, mineral oils in India. Thus, all amounts pertaining to the\n      aforesaid activity which are received on account of provisions of services and\n      facilities in connection with the said facility are treated as profits and gains of\n      the business. This clause clarifies that the amount so paid shall be taxable\n      whether these are received in India or outside India; Clause (b) deals with\n      amount received or deemed to be received in India in connection with such\n      services and facilities as stipulated therein. Thus, whereas clause (a) mentions\n      the amount which is paid or payable, clause (b) deals with the amounts which\n      are received or deemed to be received in India. In respect of amount paid or\n      payable under clause (a) of sub-section (2), it is immaterial whether these are\n      paid in India or outside India. On the other hand, amount received or deemed\n      to be received have to be in India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">29.    Thus, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex court has held that the amount which is covered in\n\nclause (a) only will be within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_155\">section 44BB</a> and not all the\n\npayments. In para 42 of the above judgment, it becomes clear that it is only certain\n\nreceipts mentioned in sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_156\">section 44BB</a> which have to be taken into\n\naccount for applying <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_157\">section 44BB</a>. In the instant case, there is no dispute to the\n\nfact that the receipts mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_158\">section 44BBB</a> has been taken into account and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                              49</span>\n                                                        ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                             ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\ntax paid by the assessee thereon. Therefore, it is wrong on the part of the Revenue\n\nto include even these receipts which are not covered by <a href=\"/doc/19072994/\" id=\"a_159\">section 44BBB</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">30.   An analysis of the various clauses of the contract between the assessee and\n\nWBSEB and NHPC and in the case of LG Cables Ltd., show that the same are\n\nsimilar. We find, in the case of LG Cables Ltd., it has entered into a contract with\n\nPower Grid Corporation of India Ltd. And has entered into two contracts. One was\n\nfor offshore supplies and services and the second one was for onshore services.\n\nThis contract was entered into on 26th February, 2001 and PGCIL was under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">Ministry of Power as is the case of the assessee where NHPC is also under\n\nMinistry of Power and the contract was entered into on 6th December, 2001. The\n\nterms of the contracts are similar as these contracts are drafted and vetted by the\n\nMinistry of Law, Government of India. The issue raised in the assessment order\n\nby the AO were also the issues in the case of LG Cables which is evident from the\n\ntable in the order passed by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court comprising the two contracts\n\nentered into by the LG Cables with PGCIL. A perusal of the decision of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble High Court shows that in this contract of LG Cables with PGCIL, the\n\ncontractor was overall responsible to ensure the execution of the two contracts to\n\nachieve successful completion. There was a cross fall breach clause in the contract\n\nalso. In para 11 of the decision, the court has taken note of the arguments of the ld.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">counsel that property in equipment passed to the buyer only in India and this\n\nproperty did not pass till equipment was erected and yielded satisfactory\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                         50</span>\n                                                       ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                            ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nperformance in India. In para 18, the Hon&#x27;ble High Court has categorically held\n\nthat none of the stipulations of the on shore contract could postpone the transfer of\n\nproperty supplied under the offshore contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">31.   As regards the issue that in the case of LG Cables, there were two contracts\n\nwhereas in the case of the assessee there are three contracts are concerned, we find\n\nthe same is without appreciating the meaning of offshore services. We find merit\n\nin the argument of the ld. Counsel for the assessee that offshore services means\n\nservices provided outside India, therefore, there cannot be any allegation that\n\noffshore services have been provided from India. We find in the present case on\n\nshore services are being provided under a third contract on which tax has been paid\n\nby the assessee for which there is no dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">32.   As regards the terms of payment in the case of LG Cables Ltd., 10% was\n\nadvance payment, 75% was progressive payment and 15% was the final payment\n\non completion of operational acceptance. As against this, we find in the case of the\n\nassessee, 10% is advance payment, 15% is also advance payment on the progress\n\nof the equipment drawings in the home country, 65% payment is on delivery and\n\nthe balance 10% on completion of operational acceptance. We, therefore, do not\n\nfind any material difference between the two contracts. As regards the basis of\n\nprice variation,/adjustment in respect of supplies made, this clause in our opinion\n\ndoes not change the nature of the contract. Further, on going through the annexure\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                         51</span>\n                                                         ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                              ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nto the contract, it is evident that there is price adjustment formula for supply of\n\nplant and equipment under this contract that is offshore supply. The contractor\n\nhaving quoted the price on the basis of the price of material and labour on the date\n\nof the tender, a clause has been inserted to make further payment in terms of this\n\nformula. Further, all these payments were to be made in foreign currency. The\n\nissue which is important is that these payments are linked to shipment of the\n\nsupplies from the country of origin i.e., Japan.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">33.   We further find the method of payment is also similar. The only difference\n\nis that in the case of LG Cables Ltd., the payment was to be made within 30 days\n\nof submission of invoice whereas in the present case it is within 60 days of\n\nsubmission of invoice. Further, in the case of LG Cables, there was a provision for\n\npro-rata payment whereas in the present case also there is a provision of pro-rata\n\npayment. In the case of LG Cables, the payment was through irrecoverable letter\n\nof credit whereas in the case of the assessee also all payments are through\n\nirrecoverable letter of credit as per clause 3.0 at page 7 of the agreement.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">34.   We further find there is no difference in the transfer of ownership to title and\n\nrisk. The term of transfer of ownership in the case of the assessee is not different\n\nthan LG Cables. We find Clause 31.1 in LG Cables also matches with the clause\n\n31.1 of the assessee&#x27;s agreement at page 116. The condition upon endorsement of\n\ndispatch documents in favour of the employer in the case of the assessee was also\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                          52</span>\n                                                           ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                                ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nin the case of LG Cables which has been quoted by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court in para\n\n17 which reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">      &quot;17.     That the offshore supply of equipment related to the supply of\n      specified goods discharged from Korea for which the PGCIL had opened an\n      irrevocable letter of credit in the name of the respondent-assessee with a bank\n      in South Korea. The consignor of the equipment supplied from Korea to\n      Haldia Port was the respondent while the importer was the PGCIL. The\n      equipment was delivered to the shipping company named in the bill of lading\n      and the bill of lading and other documents were handed over to the nominated\n      bank. Accordingly, with the delivery of the bill of lading to the bank, the\n      property in the goods stood transferred to PGCIL. The cargo insurance policy\n      was obtained by the respondent-assessee and it named the PGCIL as co-\n      insurer. Clause 31.2 of the contract unequivocally clarified that the\n      respondent-assessee and the PGCIL intended to transfer the title/property in\n      the goods as soon as the goods were loaded on to the ship at the port of\n      shipment and the shipping documents were handed over to the nominated\n      bank where the letter of credit was opened. The sale was complete and\n      unequivocal. There is no condition in the contract which empowers the\n      respondent to keep control of the goods and/or to repossess the same. With the\n      completion of this sale the income accrued outside India. There was neither\n      any material to show that accrual of such income was attributable to any\n      operations carried out in India nor any material to show that the PE of the\n      respondent-assessee had any role to play in the offshore supply of the\n      equipments.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">35.    Further, we find clause 31.4 in assessee&#x27;s case is also identical to LG Cables\n\nwhich can be seen from the numbering. Moreover, in our opinion, this clause\n\nneeds to be understood in the context in which it has been stated. Further, clause\n\n31.4 is part of the general conditions of contract which is common to all three\n\ncontracts and, thus, the application of any clause will be with reference to that\n\nparticular contract to which it has implication and not to other contract.\n\nAccordingly, the first line of this clause 31.4 in our opinion is meant for onshore\n\nsupply i.e., supplies from within India under second contract and not under first\n\ncontract i.e., offshore supply. The first contract is for offshore supply and quantity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                            53</span>\n                                                            ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                                 ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nof plant and equipment has been specified in schedule 1 at page 36 to page 38 of\n\nthe contract. Thus, offshore supplies cannot be returned.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">36.    Clause 31.5 regarding the risk of loss and damage has a limited meaning of a\n\nresponsibility which is bailee.        The assessee has to take care of plant and\n\nequipment while carrying out erection. This does not mean that ownership is that\n\nof the assessee. As against this, there are various clauses which provide that in\n\ncase of any loss, the same will be to the account of the employer and not the\n\nassessee which can be seen from para 92.2 at page 117, 38.1 and 38.2 at page 124\n\nof the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">37.    So far as the reliance on the decision in the case of Usha Beltron Ltd. v.\n\nState of Punjab (2205) 7 SCC 58 on the issue of transfer of title of the goods is\n\nconcerned, the same, in our opinion, is misplaced. A perusal of the following\n\nobservation of the decision makes it very clear that the said decision is not\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case.:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">      &quot;These terms clearly indicate that the property in the goods remain at the risk\n      of the appellant till delivery was completed. It shows that delivery would be\n      completed only after the takeover certificate was issued. /As per <a href=\"/doc/137624/\" id=\"a_160\">section 19</a> of\n      the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the property in the goods passes when the parties\n      intend to pass. In this case, the contract provides that property in the goods\n      does not pass till after delivery and successful testing and issuance of takeover\n      certificate. Thus, High Court was right in concluding that the property in the\n      goods had not passed at the time the goods entered the Municipal Limits.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">38.    The issue before the court in this case was to infer transfer of ownership in\n\nthe absence of any clause in the agreement. The court noted that as per <a href=\"/doc/137624/\" id=\"a_161\">section 19</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                             <a href=\"/doc/298488/\" id=\"a_162\">54</a></span>\n                                                           ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                                ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_163\">Sale of Goods Act, 1930</a>, the property in the goods passes when the parties\n\nintend to pass. Thus, it is the agreement between the parties which will determine\n\nwhen the ownership will pass.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">39.    In the present case, a perusal of clause 31.1 and 31.2 clearly shows that the\n\nproperty in goods will pass when it is loaded on to the mode of transport in the\n\ncountry of origin. Thus, there is no ambiguity and this clause will clearly be\n\napplicable. We find the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court on this very issue at para 18 of\n\nthe order has observed as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">      &quot;18. Furthermore, as noticed above, the scope of work under the onshore\n      contract was under a separate agreement and for separate consideration. There\n      is, therefore, in our opinion no justification to mix the consideration for the\n      offshore and onshore contracts. None of the stipulations of the onshore\n      contract could conceivably postpone the transfer of property of the equipments\n      supplied under the offshore contract, which, in accordance with the agreement,\n      had been unconditionally appropriated at the time of delivery, at the port of\n      shipment. When the equipment was transferred outside India, necessarily the\n      taxable income also accrued outside India, and hence no portion of such\n      income was taxable in India.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"500072\" id=\"span_83\">40.

In para 179 of the said order, the\n\nTribunal has observed as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">      &quot;179. It is further pertinent to note that in the agreements entered into , by\n      assessee with various project owners, payment in the contract schedule are not\n      related with sale of equipments. But payments are linked with the different\n      stages like signing of contract, raising of invoice, submission of invoice for\n      advance payments, submission of advance bank guarantee, submission of\n      performance bank guarantee, design, drawing, successful commissioning of\n      power plant. In all, the payments are related to entire work entrusted upon\n      assessee includes, supervisory services that assessee has to render in India. It\n      has been consistently observed in all contracts that, major milestone in\n      payment schedule does not mention about supply/sale of BTG equipments, but\n      recognizes incidents like signing of contracts, raising invoice, submitting of\n      performance Bank Guarantee by assessee to the project owner, Submitting of\n      Advance Bank Guarantee by assessee to the project owner,\n      engineering/architectural works, supply of equipments, testing of equipments\n      and commissioning of the power plant followed by issuance of performance\n      guarantee test certificates.

In this case, the Tribunal has observed that in respect of the contracts entered\n\ninto by Shanghai Electric Group Company Ltd., all the payments were related to\n\nentire work entrusted upon the company which included supervisory services that\n\nthe company has to render in India. It has been observed by the Tribunal that there\n\nwere no identifiable payments exclusively made for supply of equipments and\n\nnone of the agreements were executed exclusively for the sale of BTG equipments.\n\nHowever, in the case of the assessee, a perusal of appendix 1 of first contract at\n\npage No.6 shows that the payments of offshore supply of plant and equipment\n\nsupplied from abroad is related with sale of equipment. Thus, the facts of the\n\nassessee&#x27;s case are on different footing than that of Shanghai Electric Group\n\nCompany. Further, in the present case there are separate contracts for the offshore\n\nsupplies and onshore supplies and onshore services. Price of each component have\n\nbeen separately specified. The offshore supplies have been completed outside\n\nIndia with ownership as well. Payment is being made through LC outside India.\n\nFurther, the PE had no role to play in offshore supplies.

It is not\nthe case of the Assessing Officer that MIPL habitually exercised authority to\nconclude contracts. It is also not the case of the Assessing Officer that MIPL\nhabitually maintains a stock of goods or merchandise. Thus, the condition of\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">(a) and (b) are not fulfilled. The third condition in (c) is habitually securing\norders for the assessee. In this regard we note that the Assessing Officer has\nmade this allegation on the basis that commission has been paid by the\nassessee company to the        MIPL. On this basis it has been assumed that\nMIPL is securing        orders.This contention       of the Assessing Officer\ndoes not appear to be correct. As per the agreement which has been quoted by\nthe Assessing Officer in the assessment order, MIPL is supposed to put best\neffort to collect information with regard to Instant Noodle project etc. to make\nthe best effort to find the best candidate, to attend/take care of the visitor from\nJapan, to make the best effort to analyze the feasibility report. None of these\nclauses can be interpreted to mean that MIPL is securing orders. On the basis\nof this clause the Assessing Officer was wrong in assuming that MIPL is\nsecuring orders. The Assessing Officer has not brought any other material to\nsubstantiate his allegation that may demonstrate that MIPL has secured orders\nfor the assessee. It is to be noted that this clause (c) uses the word &#x27;habitually\nsecures orders&#x27;. Thus, there has to be procurement of       orders habitually. As\nagainst this the assessee&#x27;s contention has been that MIPL is only providing\nsupport services and it is not securing order on behalf of assessee company. It\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                        63</span>\n                                                        ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                             ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nmay be relevant to further mention that the expression &#x27;has&#x27; shall mean a legal\nexistence. Whereas &#x27;habitually secures orders&#x27; shall mean a systematic\nconduct on the part of the agent. Thus it is not only a legal right to secure\norder but also it is to be found, as a matter of fact that agent has habitually\nsecured order.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">4.2      Further, in this case the TP study of MIPL was subject matter of\nexamination by the TPO. The FAR (Function performed, Assets deployed and\nRisk assumed) analysis has been accepted by the TPO. These agreement on\nthe basis of which Assessing Officer has levied the allegation were also before\nthe TPO. Thus, there cannot be any allegation that MIPL has performed any\nfunction beyond what has been stated. Functional and economic analysis of\nthe transactions entered into having been examined nothing further can be\nimputed. The services of MIPL to assessee company were support services\nsimilar to the activities of a Liaison offices. This fact gets also supported from\nthe finding recorded by the Assessing Officer himself in the assessment order\non page 26 whereby it has been stated by the Assessing Officer that MIPL is\nfunctioning in the same manner as the LOs of the assessee are functioning in\nIndia. It has already been held that LOs do not constitutes PE in India. Thus,\nthe functioning of MIPL though a subsidiary and a company incorporated in\nIndia but its activities vis-a-vis assessee company were akin to liaison office.\nIt does not have authority to conclude contract, it was not maintaining any\nstocks of goods and merchandise nor it was securing order for the assessee\ncompany. In view of the above facts we reject the contention of the learned\nCIT-DR that MIPL habitually secures order for the assessee company. And\naccordingly, none of the condition prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_186\">Article 5(7)</a> are fulfilled.\n\n4.3      The second contention of the learned DR was that MIPL is\neconomically dependent on assessee company as major revenue of MIPL is\nfrom assessee company. We are of the view that this per se cannot be ground\nto hold that MIPL is a Dependent Agent. For invoking this clause, first one of\nthe three conditions needs to be fulfilled. As we have held hereinabove that\nMIPL does not get covered as PE under <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_187\">Article 5(7)</a>, it cannot be considered\nto be a Dependent Agent. The learned DR also made a reference to\nConventions on Double Taxation by Klaus Vogel to support its contention that\nwhere a person works only for one principle such person is economically\ndependent on the principal. In these circumstances the agent though not legally\nbut will be bound to obey his principal&#x27;s instructions and be regarded as being\nDependent Agent. This contention of the learned CIT-DR again ignores the\nbasic requirement i.e. fulfilling one of the three conditions. It is also important\nto note that the DTAA provide for treating a person as Dependent Agent. The\nDTAA has to be strictly interpreted. The DTAA having prescribed the\nconditions, no further conditions can be read. What learned CIT-DR is\ncanvassing will mean adding new condition in the DTAA. Further, it may be\nrelevant to note that as per Para 9 of this <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_188\">Article 5</a> in DTAA, it has been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                        64</span>\n                                                      ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                           ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nspecifically provided that if a company in the contracting state is controlled by\na company in the other contracting state that itself shall not itself constitute\neither of company a permanent establishment of the other. Thus, the fact that\nMIPL is controlled by the assessee company shall not mean that MIPL is a PE\nof the assessee company.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">4.4      Our view gets supported by the judgement of Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High\nCourt in the case of Director of Income Tax And Others Versus M/s E Funds\nIT Solution And Others 364 ITR 256 Delhi f where the Hon&#x27;ble court has held\nas under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">     &quot;31. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_189\">Article 5</a> relate to creation of agency PE\n     in the second contracting country. Agency replaces fixed place with\n     personal connection. Arvid K. Skaar in his work &quot;Permanent\n     Establishment&quot; has opined that primacy of &quot;location test&quot; of the basic\n     rule is consistent with the conceptual structure of the PE clause itself.\n     An agency will constitute a PE only when a PE cannot be found\n     according to those conditions in the basic rule which are altered or\n     replaced by the agency clause. OECD and UN Model Treaties\n     recognize agency PE. The principle being, that a foreign enterprise\n     may choose to perform business activities itself or through a third\n     person in the other States. An agent is a representative who acts on\n     behalf of another with third persons. International taxation laws\n     recognize and accept two distinct types of agency PE, dependent and\n     independent. Every agent by very nature of principle of agency is to\n     follow principaV&#x27;s instructions. But this principle is not squarely\n     applicable to DTAAs, as third parties may not be strictly an agent\n     under the domestic law. Further, the aforesaid dependency cannot be\n     the distinguishing factor which determines whether the agency is\n     dependent or an independent agency for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 5</a>\n     paragraphs 4 and 5 respectively. A dependent agency is one which is\n     bound to follow instructions and is personally dependent on the\n     enterprise he represents. Such dependency must not be isolated or\n     once in a while transaction but should be of comprehensive nature.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">     32.        The &quot;dependency test&quot; as per Arvid A. Skaar requires\n     examination and answer whether the business interest of the principal\n     and the agency have merged. When there is evidence of merging of\n     interest, then power to instruct the agent exceeds a certain level. In\n     such cases the Principal regularly participates in the process of\n     settling current business problems or exercises discretionary power in\n     the said respects. OECD Commentary does not accept dependency\n     based on financial support, supply of patents etc. as itself creating\n     agency PE. Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions, Third\n     Edition at page 345 in paragraph 170 states that interdependence\n     must exist in both legal and economic respects but the independence is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                       65</span>\n                                                ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                     ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nthe main criteria. The expression &quot;independent agent&quot; is used with\nthe words &quot;brokers and general commission agents&quot; in paragraph 5\nof <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 5</a> will, therefore, normally not include agents who have\npower to conclude contracts. Paragraph 38.1 of the OECD\nCommentary has been quoted above (see paragraph 15). The\ncommentary elucidates and gives illustrations and tests.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">33.       Earlier U.N. commentary had deviated in some respect\nfrom the OECD commentary and had observed that an agent who was\nwholly or almost wholly engaged by one principal shall be considered\nto be a dependent agent. This initial position stated in UN\ncommentary has, however, not been accept in subsequent\ncommentaries. The essential criteria being arms length relationship\nthough engagement with one or a group might serve as an indicator of\nabsence of independence of an agent.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">34.        Subsidiary by itself cannot be considered to be a dependent\nagent PE of the Principal, otherwise it would negate the overriding\neffect of paragraph 6 to <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 5</a>, a provision which precedes and\nseeks to give recognition to separate legal entity principle associated\nwith juristic incorporated enterprises. However, a subsidiary may\nbecome dependent or an independent PE agent provided the tests as\nspecified in paragraphs 4 and 5 are satisfied. A dependent agent is\ndeemed to be PE of the principal establishment under paragraph 4, if\none of the three conditions specified in sub-clause (a) to (c) are\nsatisfied. Under sub-clause (a), a dependent agent should have\nauthority and should habitually exercise the said authority to\nconclude contracts on behalf of the foreign enterprise. What is meant\nby the term &quot;authority to conclude contract&quot; has been subject matter\nof controversy on whether participation in negotiations by the agent is\nsufficient or not. However, this is not relevant for the decision of the\npresent appeals in view of the factual matrix of the present case. Sub-\nclause (b) refers to an agent who habitually maintains stock of goods\nor merchandise from which he regularly delivers goods or\nmerchandise on behalf of the principal enterprise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">In such cases, the agent should also perform some additional\nactivities in its country on behalf of the foreign enterprise which has\ncontributed to the sale of goods or merchandise. Sub-clause (c)\napplies when the agent habitually secures orders in the said country\ni.e. where he is located, almost wholly or wholly for the foreign\nenterprise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">35.      Transactions between a foreign enterprise and an\nindependent agent, do not result in establishment of a permanent\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                 66</span>\n                                                 ITA Nos.2801,4329 &amp; 4367/Del/2011\n                                                      ITA Nos.794 &amp; 795/Del/2012\n\n\nestablishment under paragraph 5 to <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_193\">Article 5</a> if the independent agent\nis acting in ordinary course of their business. The expression\n&quot;ordinary course of their business&quot; has reference to activity of the\nagent tested by reference to normal customs in the case in issue. It has\nreference to normal practice in the line of business in question.\nHowever as per paragraph 5 of <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 5</a>, an agent is not considered\nto be an independent agent if his activities are wholly or mostly wholly\non behalf of foreign enterprise and the transactions between the two\nare not made under arm&quot;s length conditions. The twin conditions\nhave to be satisfied to deny an agent character of an independent\nagent. In case the transactions between an agent and the foreign\nprincipal are under arm&quot;s length conditions the second stipulation in\nparagraph 5 of <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 5</a> would not be satisfied, even if the said agent\nis devoted wholly or almost wholly to the foreign enterprise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">36.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"584977\" id=\"span_108\">In <a href=\"/doc/584977/\" id=\"a_196\">Morgan Stanley</a> (supra) Supreme Court rejected the\ncontention of the Revenue that dependent agency was created after\nrecording that Indian subsidiary had no authority to enter into or\nconclude contracts on behalf of the foreign establishment / agency.\nThe contracts were entered into in America and were concluded there.\nOnly implementation of those contracts to the extent of back office\noperations were carried out in India.

The relevant part of the judgment\nreads as under:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">     &quot; The object behind enactment of transfer pricing regulations is to\n     prevent shifting of profits outside India. Under <a href=\"/doc/544105/\" id=\"a_201\">article 7(2)</a> not all\n     profits of MSCo would be taxable in India but only those which have\n     economic nexus with P.E. in India. A foreign enterprise is liable to be\n     taxed in India on so much of its business profit as is attributable to the\n     P.E. in India. The quantum of taxable income is to be determined in\n     accordance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_202\">Income-tax Act</a>. All provisions\n     of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_203\">Income-tax Act</a> are applicable, including provisions relating to\n     depreciation, investment losses, deductible expenses, carry-forward\n     and set-off losses etc. However, deviations are made by the DTAA in\n     cases of royalty, interest etc. Such deviations are also made under the\n     <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_204\">Income-tax Act</a> (for example: <a href=\"/doc/68567845/\" id=\"a_205\">sections 44BB</a>, <a href=\"/doc/89460576/\" id=\"a_206\">44BBA</a> etc.). Under the\n     impugned ruling delivered by the AAR, remuneration to MSAS was\n     justified by a transfer pricing analysis and, therefore, no further\n     income could be attributed to the P.E. (MSAS). In other words, the\n     said ruling equates an arm&#x27;s length analysis (ALA) with attribution of\n     profits. It holds that once a transfer pricing analysis is undertaken;\n     there is no further need to attribute profits to a P.E. The impugned\n     ruling is correct in principle in so far as an associated enterprise, that\n     also constitutes a P.E., has been remunerated on an arm&#x27;s length basis\n     taking into account all the risk-taking functions of the enterprise. In\n     such cases nothing further would be left to be attributed to the P.E.\n     The situation would be different if transfer pricing analysis does not\n     adequately reflect the functions performed and the risks assumed by\n     the enterprise. In such a situation, there would be a need to attribute\n     profits to the P.E. for those functions/risks that have not been\n     considered. Therefore, in each case the data placed by the taxpayer\n     has to be examined as to whether the transfer pricing analysis placed\n     by the taxpayer is exhaustive of attribution of profits and that would\n     depend on the functional and factual analysis to be undertaken in\n     each case. Lastly, it may be added that taxing corp orates on the basis\n     of the concept of economic nexus is an important feature of\n     attributable profits (profits attributable to the P.E.). &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">     As regard the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that the\n     situation will be different if the Transfer Pricing analysis does not\n     adequately reflect the functions performed and the risk assumed by the\n     enterprise.

This conclusion of the Commissioner has been upheld by the\n     Tribunal. It noted the rival contentions and in great details. The\n     Tribunal concluded that after referring to the clauses in the agreement\n     between the assessee and B4U that B4U India is not a decision maker\n     nor it has the authority to conclude contracts (see paragraph 29).\n     Further, the Revenue has not brought anything on record to prove that\n     agent has such powers and from the agreement any such conclusion\n     could not have been drawn. Barring this agreement, there is no\n     material or evidence with the Assessing Officer to disprove the claim\n     of the assessee that the agent has no power to conclude the contract.\n     This finding is rendered on a complete reading of the agreement.\n     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"584977\" id=\"span_121\">Thereafter Indo-Mauritius DTAA has been referred to and\n     particularly paragraphs 5.4 and 5.5. and the Tribunal concludes that\n     the requirement that the first enterprise in the first mentioned State\n     has and habitually exercised in that State an authority to conclude\n     contracts in the name of the enterprise unless his activities are limited\n     to the purchase of goods or merchandise for the enterprise is a\n     condition which is not satisfied. Therefore, this is not a case of B4U\n     India being an agent with an independent status. This finding is\n     rendered in paragraph 29 and 30 of the order under challenge.

We are not agreement with Mr. Tejveer Singh when he\nsubmits that the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Morgan\nStanley &amp; Co. will not apply. In that regard he relies upon the\nconclusion rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. That conclusion\nis that there being no need for attribution of further profits to the\npermanent establishment of the foreign company where the\ntransaction between the two was held to be at arm&#x27;s length but this\nwas only provided that the associate enterprise was remunerated at\narm&#x27;s length basis taking into account all the risk taking functions of\nthe multinational enterprise. Thus, Mr. Tejveer Singh&#x27;s reliance on\nthese observations in the Supreme Court judgment are strictly on the\nalternate argument canvassed by the assessee. That alternate\nargument was that assuming that B4U India is a dependent agent of\nthe assessee in India it has been remunerated at arm&#x27;s length price\nand, therefore, no profits can be attributed to the assessee. Mr.\nTejveer Singh would submit that the Tribunal failed to note that the\nsituation would be different if the transfer price analysis did not\nadequately reflect the functions performed and the risks assumed by\nthe enterprise. In such a case, there would be need to attribute profits\nto the permanent establishment for those functions / risks that had not\nbeen considered. Mr. Tejveer Singh&#x27;s argument is that the assessee\nhad not subjected itself to the transfer price regime. Therefore, no\nassistance can be derived by it from this judgment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"111702811\" id=\"span_123\">12.       In this regard, Mr. Mistri has rightly pointed out that the\nrequirement and in relation to computation of income from\ninternational transactions having regard to arm&#x27;s length price has\nbeen put in place in Chapter-X listing special provisions relating to\navoidance of tax by substituting <a href=\"/doc/1942568/\" id=\"a_222\">section 92</a> to <a href=\"/doc/51467360/\" id=\"a_223\">92F</a> by the <a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_224\">Finance Act</a>\nof 2001 with effect from 1st April, 2002. Therefore, such compliance\nhas to be made with effect from assessment years 2002-03 relevant to\nwhich is the previous year commencing from 1st April, 2002. In any\nevent, we find that the Tribunal has rightly dealt with the alternate\nargument by referring to the Revenue\n\nCircular 742. There, 15% is taken to be the basis for the arm&#x27;s length\nprice. Nothing contrary to the same having been brought on record by\nthe Revenue before the Commissioner as also the Tribunal, it rightly\nconcluded that the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Morgan\nStanley &amp; Co. and the principle therein would apply.
