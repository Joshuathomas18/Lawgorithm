This order shall govern disposal of Arbitration Appeal No.43 of 2017 as well\n     as Arbitration Appeal No.46 of 2017 arising out of common order dated\n     21.3.2017 passed by Commercial Court, deciding application under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n     34</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as\n     &quot;the Act of 1996&quot;) filed by M/s. Univabs Sleepers Pvt. Ltd. (MJC No.7/2016)\n     as also application under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996 filed by Union of\n     India (MJC No.16 of 2016).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">  2. The Union of India and M/s. Univabs Sleepers Pvt. Ltd. both have preferred\n     the aforesaid separate appeals which were clubbed together and heard\n     analogously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">  3. M/s. Univabs Sleepers Pvt. Ltd. entered into contract with the Union of\n     India through its competent authority on 2.2.2006 for manufacture and\n     supply of Monoblock Prestressed Concrete Sleepers for Broad Gauge. The\n     contract was initially for a period of two years and one month, to be\n     reckoned from 26.12.2005 to 25.01.2008. Under the contract, M/s. Univabs\n     Sleepers Pvt. Ltd. was to manufacture and supply of 255000 (two lakh fifty\n     five thousand) number of sleepers. Later on, the quantity of supply was\n     enhanced by further quantity of 76500 (seventy six thousand five hundred)\n     number of sleepers and the period of contract was further extended up to\n     31.12.2008. Dispute arose between the parties when the manufacturer\n     failed to supply required quantity of sleepers as per time schedule, to\n     Union of India. While according to manufacturer/supplier, the main\n     operative reason was that the nominated source for supply of cement\n     failed to supply requisite quantity of cement to the manufacturer/supplier,\n     Union of India maintained that manufacturer/supplier failed to maintain its\n     manufacturing process of sleepers and was taking shelter of a false excuse\n     of non-supply of cement in requisite quantity from the nominated source.\n     Finally, the Union of India terminated the contract and claimed liquidated\n     damages,    aggrieved   by   which,    the   manufacture/supplier   invoked\n     arbitration clause under the contract and Reference was made for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                      -3-</span>\n\n\n  arbitration to the Sole Arbitrator under the terms of contract. Initially, while\n  seeking reference of dispute, the manufacturer/supplier had raised only 6\n  claims, but while submitting its claim before the Arbitrator, the supplier\n  added 5 more claims making as many as 11 claims against Union of India.\n  The Union of India filed its written statement and also raised counter\n  claims and prayed for liquidated damages alleging that the manufacturer/\n  supplier committed breach of contract in failing to supply sleepers as per\n  the contracted schedule of supply. The Arbitrator, vide its Award, rejected\n  all the claims of the manufacturer/supplier as well as Union of India.\n  Aggrieved by the Award, the manufacturer/supplier as well as Union of\n  India both preferred separate applications under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 34</a> of the Act of\n  1996 before the Commercial Court. The Commercial Court held that in so\n  far as Claimant&#x27;s additional claims No.1,3, &amp; 8 (a &amp; b) and 11 are\n  concerned, the Arbitrator was obliged under the law to adjudicate those\n  claims and could not have rejected on the ground that in the letter making\n  reference of dispute to the Arbitrator, those claims were not included. On\n  Claimant&#x27;s claims No.2 &amp; 6, the Commercial Court held that the Arbitrator\n  acted perversely and in violation of fundamental policy of law in not\n  awarding damages despite having recorded a finding that the Union of\n  India was guilty of breach of contract, due to which, the supplier/claimant\n  had suffered loss. The findings on supplier&#x27;s/claimant&#x27;s claim No.4, 5, 7 &amp;\n  10 recorded by the Arbitrator were not interfered with by the Commercial\n  Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">  The Commercial Court, on aforesaid findings, set aside the Award leaving\n  the Claimant to work out its remedy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">  In so far as claim for liquidated damages of Union of India was concerned,\n  that was also not accepted and the finding of the Arbitrator on the counter\n  claim were not interfered with by the Commercial Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">  Submissions made in Arbitration Appeal No.43 of 2017\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4. Learned   counsel    for   the   appellant-   Ms.   Univabs    Sleepers    Pvt.\n  Ltd./Manufacturer, contended that once the Commercial Court came to the\n  conclusion that additional claims No.1, 3, 8 (a) (b) and 11 were also liable to\n  be adjudicated by the Arbitrator and further that despite breach of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                        -4-</span>\n\n\n        agreement by Union of India is established, the appellant was entitled to\n        damages, it ought to have decided the claims on its merits. According to\n        learned counsel for the appellant-Ms. Univabs Sleepers, the Commercial\n        Court, while entertaining an application under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 34</a> of the Act of\n        1996, had power not only to set aside the Award once it is found to be\n        vitiated on the ground enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996 but\n        also inappropriate cases, to modify or vary the award to do complete\n        justice between the parties rather than mechanically setting aside and\n        relegating the matter to the Arbitrator again. According to him, the\n        Commercial Court, under a misconceived notion of law, that it only had the\n        power to set aside the award and nothing more, instead of granting\n        appropriate relief by modifying the award, sent the appellant before the\n        Arbitrator and thus frustrating the very object of the Act of 1996 in\n        providing an expeditious and effective remedy in arbitration dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">        The other submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that in so far\n        as appellant&#x27;s claims No.4, 5, 7 &amp; 10 are concerned, the learned\n        Commercial Court has not examined those claims with reference to the\n        specific ground urged in the application under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996\n        with reference to the pleadings and evidence of the parties in the\n        Arbitration Proceeding and has mechanically recorded that those claims\n        were rightly rejected by the Arbitrator. In support of his submission, he\n        placed reliance upon several authorities1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">    5. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-Union of India\n        submitted that as far as claims No.1, 3, 8 (a) (b) and 11 are concerned, they\n        were all additional claims, which did not form part of the reference made\n        to the Arbitrator at the instance of the supplier/manufacturer and,\n        therefore, it was beyond the scope of reference and the Arbitrator rightly\n        held that it had jurisdiction to adjudicate only upon those specific claims on\n        which reference was made. He submits that in the appeal filed by Union of\n        India (ARBA No.46 of 2017), the Union of India has raised specific ground\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"136518863\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1863554\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529896\" id=\"span_5\">1. <a href=\"/doc/529896/\" id=\"a_7\">Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Vs.

As far as claims No.4, 5, 7 &amp; 10 are\n   concerned, learned counsel for the respondent- Union of India argued that\n   these claims were not at all made out because those claims have been\n   raised by the claimant/supplier against the specific terms and conditions of\n   contract between the parties. The Arbitrator has considered the aforesaid\n   claims and upon construction of terms of contract, has taken a view, which,\n   essentially, is on the merits of the issue and even if another view is\n   possible, in the absence of any ground made out as specifically\n   enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996, it was not within the\n   jurisdiction of the Commercial Court to interfere with the Award in so far as\n   supplier&#x27;s claims No.4, 5, 7 &amp; 10 are concerned and therefore the\n   Commercial Court rightly rejected the claims refusing to interfere with the\n   findings of Arbitrator.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">   As far as claims No.2 &amp; 6 are concerned, learned counsel for respondent-\n   Union of India argued that those claims are founded on alleged breach of\n   contract whereas according to Union of India, it has not breached the\n   contract. The Union of India filed application for setting aside the award to\n   the extent it held the Union of India responsible for breach of contract but\n   the Commercial Court has wrongly rejected the application and it is the\n   case of respondent-Union of India that it did not commit breach of contract\n   which issue has been raised by the Union of India in its Arbitration Appeal\n   No.46 of 2017 separately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">   Last submission of learned counsel for the respondent-Union of India is\n   that in any case, the Commercial Court could not quantify, even if every\n   submission of the appellant- Ms. Univabs Ltd. is accepted, as it could only\n   set aside the Award. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_7\">In support of the submission, reliance has been placed\n   on <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_11\">Mcdermott International Inc.

Learned counsel appearing for the appellant i.e. Union of India assailed\n   legality and validity of the order passed by the Commercial Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                    -6-</span>\n\n\nprincipally on the submission that in so far as finding of claims No.1, 3, 8 (a)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">(b) and 11 are concerned, it suffers from patent illegality and perversity.\nLearned counsel for Union of India argued in extenso and contended that\nin the present case, the Arbitrator correctly held that it had jurisdiction to\nadjudicate only upon those claims which were referred under the\nreference. According to him, as there was otherwise agreement between\nthe parties, as per Clause 2900 of the Indian Railways Standard Conditions\nof Contract (IRS), sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1460737/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 23</a> of the Act of 1996 is not\nattracted and thus, it was not open for the claimant- supplier to amend and\nsupplement its claim after reference of dispute to the Arbitrator. In his\nsubmission, under no circumstance, additional claim could be raised and,\ntherefore, the Arbitrator had rejected, but the Commercial Court, ignoring\nthe aforesaid settled legal position in this regard, has erroneously held that\nthe claimant-suppliers could supplement the claims and raise new claim\nwhile filing statement of claim before the Arbitrator, wrongly invoking\n<a href=\"/doc/546184/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 23 (3)</a> of the Act of 1996. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"529896\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"267861\" id=\"span_10\">In support of his contention, learned\ncounsel for the Union of India <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_14\">placed reliance upon</a> the decisions in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/267861/\" id=\"a_15\">State of Goa Vs.

Dewan\nChand Ram Saran</a> (2012) 5 SCC 306.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">Next submission of learned counsel for the appellant-Union of India in this\nappeal is that the Arbitrator has recorded perverse finding suffering from\npatent illegality in so far as alleged breach of contract by Union of India is\nconcerned. He would submit that there were specific pleadings made in the\nreply of Union of India clearly stating that there was no breach of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   -7-</span>\n\n\nagreement by the Union of India because the supplier was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">contractual obligation to manufacture and supply required quantity of\nsleepers in accordance with time schedule, which it failed to perform and\nto camouflage its failure, raised hypothetical case of short supply of cement\nby sponsored suppliers. He would submit that non-supply of cement was\nnot the cause for less production because the reason for less production\nwas not the shortage of supply of cement but because the supplier did not\nadhere to its optimum production capacity of operating the manufacturing\nunit in three shifts. Learned counsel for appellant-Union of India made\nfurther argument that under the agreement between the parties, the only\nobligation cast on the Union of India was to sponsor cement supplier which\nwas done by it. Even if it is assumed, though not admitted, that the\nsponsored supplier failed to supply required quantity of cement, it could\nnot, in the eyes of law, be said to be breach of contract by Union of India\nand, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 73</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (hereinafter\nreferred to as &quot;the Act of 1872&quot;) will have no application at all. Learned\ncounsel for the Union of India further argued that as far as Arbitrator&#x27;s\nfinding with regard to delayed lifting of manufactured sleepers is\nconcerned, there is clinching material evidence on record that stacked\nmaterial was much less than the capacity of stacking area, therefore, non-\nlifting of the material could not be taken as an excuse of slowing down the\nproduction. On the aforesaid aspect, specific reply was given by the Union\nof India which did not receive any consideration by the Arbitrator. Thus, it\nis argued, remoteness of production with supply of cement and availability\nof stacking place having been established, no case of breach of contract\ncould be said to be made out by Union of India and thus, no damages\ncould be claimed under <a href=\"/doc/1544432/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 73</a> of the Act of 1872 by the Claimant. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_13\">The\nfindings in this regard are, therefore, perverse and in conflict with the\npublic policy. Therefore, the finding of the Arbitrator that on claims No.2 &amp;\n6, even though no damages have been awarded, to the extent it held the\nUnion of India liable for breach of contract, are unsustainable in law. The\nCommercial Court did not appreciate the aforesaid settled legal aspect and\nacting perversely, committed patent illegality by remitting the matter to the\nArbitrator. Reliance has been placed <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_22\">Associate Builders Vs.

In reply, learned counsel for the respondent-M/s. Univabs Ltd. in this\n  appeal, argued that the finding of the Arbitrator that claims No.1, 2, 8 (a) (b)\n  and 11 are beyond the scope of reference was patently erroneous and\n  illegal against the judicial verdict of the Supreme Court in the case of\n  Praveen Enterprises (supra) which has rightly been interfered with by the\n  Commercial Court, though, according to this respondent, the Commercial\n  Court, instead of remitting the matter to the Arbitrator, ought to have itself\n  adjudicated upon those claims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">  It is next submitted that the Arbitrator&#x27;s finding on claims No.2 &amp; 6\n  regarding breach of contract by the Union of India is on the merits of the\n  case, upon assessment of oral and documentary evidence, and does not\n  suffer either from any patent illegality, perversity nor can be said to be in\n  conflict with the public policy of India. Therefore, the appeal of the Union\n  of India is liable to be dismissed, more so when memo of Arbitration\n  Appeal No.46 of 2017 shows that the appeal is directed only against order\n  passed in MJC No.7 of 2016 and not MJC No.16 of 2016, meaning thereby\n  that no appeal has been filed before this Court by the Union of India\n  against rejection of its application under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">8.

A comparative reading of <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 34</a>,\n   before and after amendment, reveals that Explanation to sub-clause (ii) of\n   clause (b) of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 34</a> has been substituted by two new\n   Explanations. Further, new sub-section (2-A) has also been added which\n   was not there in the unamended provision. Moreover, two new sub-\n   sections (5) and (6) have also been added.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">         The Explanation clause appended to sub-clause (ii) as described\n   earlier, explains as to when an award could be said to be in conflict with\n   public policy of India. Without prejudice to the generality of sub-clause (ii)\n   and for the avoidance of any doubt, the explanation clause reads that an\n   Award is in conflict with the public policy of India if the making of the\n   Award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of\n   <a href=\"/doc/109874/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 75</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1034395/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 81</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">         The Explanation contained in sub-clause (ii), as it stood prior to\n   Amendment of 2015, came up for consideration and interpreted by the\n   Supreme Court in series of decisions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_20\">In one of those decisions in\n   <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_36\">Associate Builders</a> (supra), the development of law with regard to scope\n   of interference under the statutory scheme of <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996\n   was considered and principles, judicially evolved in earlier judgments, were\n   re-stated.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"919241\" id=\"span_21\">One of the earliest decisions rendered in the case of <a href=\"/doc/919241/\" id=\"a_38\">ONGC Ltd.\n   Vs.

Therefore, in our view, the phrase &quot;public\npolicy of India&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 34</a> in context is\nrequired to be given a wider meaning. It can be\nstated that the concept of public policy connotes\nsome matter which concerns public good and the\npublic interest. What is for public good or in public\ninterest or what would be injurious or harmful to the\npublic good or public interest has varied from time\nto time. However, the award which is, on the face of\nit, patently in violation of statutory provisions cannot\nbe       said   to    be    in       public   interest.   Such\naward/judgment/decision is likely to adversely affect\nthe administration of justice. Hence, in our view in\naddition to narrower meaning given to the term\n&quot;public policy&quot; in Renusagar case [1994 Supp (1) SCC\n644] it is required to be held that the award could be\nset aside if it is patently illegal.

What        then     would       constitute         the\n&quot;fundamental policy of Indian law&quot; is the\nquestion. The decision in ONGC [ONGC Ltd. v.\nSaw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] does not\nelaborate that aspect. Even so, the expression\nmust,   in     our       opinion,    include      all     such\nfundamental principles as providing a basis for\nadministration of justice and enforcement of\nlaw in this country. Without meaning to\nexhaustively enumerate the purport of the\nexpression &quot;fundamental policy of Indian law&quot;,\nwe may refer to three distinct and fundamental\njuristic principles that must necessarily be\nunderstood as a part and parcel of the\nfundamental policy of Indian law. The first and\nforemost     is     the     principle    that     in     every\ndetermination whether by a court or other\nauthority that affects the rights of a citizen or\nleads to any civil consequences, the court or\nauthority concerned is bound to adopt what is\nin legal parlance called a &quot;judicial approach&quot; in\nthe matter. The duty to adopt a judicial\napproach arises from the very nature of the\npower exercised by the court or the authority\ndoes not have to be separately or additionally\nenjoined upon the fora concerned. What must\nbe remembered is that the importance of a\njudicial approach in judicial and quasi-judicial\ndetermination lies in the fact that so long as the\ncourt, tribunal or the authority exercising\npowers that affect the rights or obligations of\nthe parties before them shows fidelity to judicial\napproach, they cannot act in an arbitrary,\ncapricious     or        whimsical      manner.         Judicial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                 -25-</span>\n\n\napproach ensures that the authority acts bona\nfide and deals with the subject in a fair,\nreasonable and objective manner and that its\ndecision is not actuated by any extraneous\nconsideration. Judicial approach in that sense\nacts as a check against flaws and faults that can\nrender the decision of a court, tribunal or\nauthority vulnerable to challenge.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">              *            *            *\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">38. Equally important and indeed fundamental\nto the policy of Indian law is the principle that a\ncourt and so also a quasi-judicial authority\nmust,   while     determining   the   rights   and\nobligations of parties before it, do so in\naccordance with the principles of natural\njustice. Besides the celebrated audi alteram\npartem rule one of the facets of the principles\nof natural justice is that the court/authority\ndeciding the matter must apply its mind to the\nattendant facts and circumstances while taking\na view one way or the other. Non-application of\nmind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication.\nApplication of mind is best demonstrated by\ndisclosure of the mind and disclosure of mind is\nbest done by recording reasons in support of\nthe decision which the court or authority is\ntaking. The requirement that an adjudicatory\nauthority must apply its mind is, in that view, so\ndeeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it\ncan be described as a fundamental policy of\nIndian law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">39. No less important is the principle now\nrecognised as a salutary juristic fundamental in\nadministrative law that a decision which is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                      -26-</span>\n\n\n      perverse or so irrational that no reasonable\n      person would have arrived at the same will not\n      be sustained in a court of law.

It must clearly be understood that when a court is\napplying the &quot;public policy&quot; test to an arbitration\naward, it does not act as a court of appeal and\nconsequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A\npossible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily\nto pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master\nof the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied\nupon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an\naward based on little evidence or on evidence which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                       -29-</span>\n\n\ndoes not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind\nwould not be held to be invalid on this score[1]. Once\nit is found that the arbitrators approach is not\narbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on\nfacts. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"478091\" id=\"span_63\">In <a href=\"/doc/478091/\" id=\"a_85\">P.R.

A court does not sit in appeal over the\n        award of an Arbitral Tribunal by reassessing or\n        reappreciating the evidence.

The Arbitral Tribunal\n        has examined the facts and held that both the\n        second respondent and the appellant are liable.\n        The case as put forward by the first respondent\n        has been accepted. Even the minority view was\n        that the second respondent was liable as\n        claimed by the first respondent, but the\n        appellant was not liable only on the ground that\n        the arbitrators appointed by the Stock Exchange\n        under Bye-law 248, in a claim against a non-\n        member, had no jurisdiction to decide a claim\n        against another member. The finding of the\n        majority is that the appellant did the transaction\n        in the name of the second respondent and is\n        therefore,   liable   along   with   the   second\n        respondent. Therefore, in the absence of any\n        ground under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 34(2)</a> of the Act, it is not\n        possible to re-examine the facts to find out\n        whether a different decision can be arrived at.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">34. It is with this very important caveat that the two\nfundamental principles which form part of the\nfundamental policy of Indian law (that the arbitrator\nmust have a judicial approach and that he must not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                         -30-</span>\n\n\n                  act perversely) are to be understood.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">The recent concept of &quot;Interest of India, Justice, Morality&quot; were also explained\nthus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">                  &quot;Interest of India\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                  35. The next ground on which an award may be set\n                  aside is that it is contrary to the interest of India.\n                  Obviously, this concerns itself with India as a member\n                  of the world community in its relations with foreign\n                  powers. As at present advised, we need not dilate on\n                  this aspect as this ground may need to evolve on a\n                  case by case basis.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">                  Justice\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">                  36. The third ground of public policy is, if an award is\n                  against justice or morality. These are two different\n                  concepts in law. An award can be said to be against\n                  justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court.\n                  An illustration of this can be given. A claimant is\n                  content with restricting his claim, let us say to Rs. 30\n                  lakhs in a statement of claim before the arbitrator and\n                  at no point does he seek to claim anything more. The\n                  arbitral award ultimately awards him 45 lakhs without\n                  any acceptable reason or justification. Obviously, this\n                  would shock the conscience of the court and the\n                  arbitral award would be liable to be set aside on the\n                  ground that it is contrary to &quot;justice&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">                  Morality\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">                  37.The other ground is of &quot;morality&quot;. Just as the\n                  expression &quot;public policy&quot; also occurs in <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 23</a> of\n                  the Indian Contract Act, so does the expression\n                  &quot;morality&quot;. Two illustrations to the said section are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                     -31-</span>\n\n\ninteresting for they explain to us the scope of the\nexpression &quot;morality&quot;.\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">      &quot;(j) A, who is B&#x27;s Mukhtar, promises to exercise\nhis influence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C\npromises to pay 1,000 rupees to A.

Point 3 - Immorality: The argument under\n      this head is rather broadly stated by the learned\n      Counsel for the appellant. The learned counsel\n      attempts to draw an analogy from the Hindu\n      Law relating to the doctrine of pious obligation\n      of sons to discharge their father&#x27;s debts and\n      contends that what the Hindu Law considers to\n      be immoral in that context may appropriately\n      be applied to a case under<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_90\"> s. 23</a> of the Contract\n      Act.

The immorality here alluded to is\n       sexual immorality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">       In the Law of Contract by Cheshire and Fifoot,\n       3rd Edn., it is stated at p. 279:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">              &quot;Although Lord Mansfield laid it down\n       that a contract contra bonos mores is illegal, the\n       law in this connection gives no extended\n       meaning to morality, but concerns itself only\n       with what is sexually reprehensible.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">       In the book on the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_92\">Indian Contract Act</a> by\n       Pollock and Mulla it is stated at p. 157:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">              &quot;The epithet &quot;immoral&quot; points, in legal\n       usage, to conduct or purposes which the State,\n       though disapproving them, is unable, or not\n       advised, to visit with direct punishment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_84\">       The learned authors confined its operation to\n       acts which are considered to be immoral\n       according to the standards of immorality\n       approved by Courts. The case law both in\n       England and India confines the operation of the\n       doctrine to sexual immorality. To cite only some\n       instances:   settlements     in     consideration   of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                -33-</span>\n\n\nconcubinage, contracts of sale or hire of things\nto be used in a brothel or by a prostitute for\npurposes      incidental   to    her    profession,\nagreements to pay money for future illicit\ncohabitation, promises in regard to marriage for\nconsideration, or contracts facilitating divorce\nare all held to be void on the ground that the\nobject is immoral.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">The word &quot;immoral&quot; is a very comprehensive\nword. Ordinarily it takes in every aspect of\npersonal conduct deviating from the standard\nnorms of life. It may also be said that what is\nrepugnant to good conscience is immoral. Its\nvarying content depends upon time, place and\nthe stage of civilization of a particular society. In\nshort, no universal standard can be laid down\nand any law based on such fluid concept\ndefeats its own purpose. The provisions of<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_93\"> S. 23</a>\nof the Contract Act indicate the legislative\nintention to give it a restricted meaning. Its\njuxtaposition with an equally illusive concept,\npublic policy, indicates that it is used in a\nrestricted sense; otherwise there would be\noverlapping of the two concepts. In its wide\nsense what is immoral may be against public\npolicy, for public policy covers political, social\nand economic ground of objection. Decided\ncases   and    authoritative    text-book   writers,\ntherefore, confined it, with every justification,\nonly to sexual immorality. The other limitation\nimposed on the word by the statute, namely,\n&quot;the court regards it as immoral&quot;, brings out the\nidea that it is also a branch of the common law\nlike the doctrine of public policy, and, therefore,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                      -34-</span>\n\n\n                      should be confined to the principles recognized\n                      and settled by Courts. Precedents confine the\n                      said concept only to sexual immorality and no\n                      case has been brought to our notice where it\n                      has been applied to any head other than sexual\n                      immorality. In the circumstances, we cannot\n                      evolve a new head so as to bring in wagers\n                      within its fold.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">                39. This Court has confined morality to sexual morality\n                so far as <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_94\">section 23</a> of the Contract Act is concerned,\n                which in the context of an arbitral award would mean\n                the enforcement of an award say for specific\n                performance of a contract involving prostitution.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">                &quot;Morality&quot; would, if it is to go beyond sexual morality\n                necessarily cover such agreements as are not illegal\n                but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores\n                of the day. However, interference on this ground\n                would also be only if something shocks the court&#x27;s\n                conscience.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">16.As to how the forth head of public policy namely &quot; Patent Illegality&quot; has to\n   be understood, before it can be said that an Award is in conflict with Public\n   Policy of India, it was elaborated as below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">                &quot;Patent Illegality\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"567147\" id=\"span_69\">40. We now come to the fourth head of public policy\n                namely, patent illegality. It must be remembered that\n                under the explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_95\">section 34 (2) (b)</a>, an award is\n                said to be in conflict with the public policy of India if\n                the making of the award was induced or affected by\n                fraud or corruption. This ground is perhaps the\n                earliest ground on which courts in England set aside\n                awards under English law. Added to this ground (in\n                1802) is the ground that an arbitral award would be\n                set aside if there were an error of law by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                      -35-</span>\n\n\narbitrator. This is explained by Lord Justice Denning in\n<a href=\"/doc/567147/\" id=\"a_96\">R v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal</a>.\nEx Parte Shaw., 1952 1 All ER 122 at page 130:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">      &quot;Leaving now the statutory tribunals, I turn to\nthe awards of the arbitrators. The Court of King&#x27;s\nBench never interfered by certiorari with the award of\nan arbitrator, because it was a private tribunal and not\nsubject to the prerogative writs. If the award was not\nmade a rule of court, the only course available to an\naggrieved party was to resist an action on the award\nor to file a bill in equity. If the award was made a rule\nof court, a motion could be made to the court to set it\naside for misconduct of the arbitrator on the ground\nthat it was procured by corruption or other undue\nmeans: see the statute 9 and 10 Will. III, c. 15. At one\ntime an award could not be upset on the ground of\nerror of law by the arbitrator because that could not\nbe said to be misconduct or undue means, but\nultimately it was held in Kent v. Elstob, (1802) 3 East\n18, that an award could be set aside for error of law\non the face of it. This was regretted by Williams, J., in\nHodgkinson v.

Though\nthe propriety of this latter may very well be doubted, I\nthink it may be considered as established.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">      *             *            *\n&quot;Now the regret expressed by Williams, J. in\nHodgkinson v. Fernie has been repeated by more than\none learned Judge, and it is certainly not to be desired\nthat the exception should be in any way extended. An\nerror in law on the face of the award means, in their\nLordships&#x27; view, that you can find in the award or a\ndocument actually incorporated        thereto, as for\ninstance, a note appended by the arbitrator stating the\nreasons for his judgment, some legal proposition\nwhich is the basis of the award and which you can\nthen say is erroneous. It does not mean that if in a\nnarrative a reference is made to a contention of one\nparty that opens the door to seeing first what that\ncontention is, and then going to the contract on which\nthe parties&#x27; rights depend to see if that contention is\nsound. Here it is impossible to say, from what is\nshown on the face of the award, what mistake the\narbitrators made. The only way that the learned judges\nhave arrived at finding what the mistake was is by\nsaying: &quot;Inasmuch as the Arbitrators awarded so and\nso, and inasmuch as the letter shows that then buyer\nrejected the cotton, the arbitrators can only have\narrived at that result by totally misinterpreting Cl.52.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                       -37-</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">But they were entitled to give their own interpretation\nto Cl. 52 or any other article, and the award will stand\nunless, on the face of it they have tied themselves\ndown to some special legal proposition which then,\nwhen examined, appears to be unsound. Upon this\npoint, therefore, their Lordships think that the\njudgment of Pratt, J was right and the conclusion of\nthe learned Judges of the Court of Appeal erroneous.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">This judgment has been consistently followed in India\nto test awards under <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 30</a> of the Arbitration Act,\n1940.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">42.

(a) A contravention of the substantive law of India\nwould result in the death knell of an arbitral award.\nThis must be understood in the sense that such\nillegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot\nbe of a trivial nature. This again is a really a\ncontravention of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 28(1)(a)</a> of the Act, which\nreads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">        &quot;28.

An    arbitral    tribunal   must   decide     in\n  accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an\n  arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a\n  reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award\n  can be set aside on this ground. Construction of the\n  terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to\n  decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract\n  in such a way that it could be said to be something\n  that no fair minded or reasonable person could do.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">43. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_75\">In <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_105\">McDermott International Inc. v.

It is trite that the terms of the contract\n       can be express or implied. The conduct of the\n       parties would also be a relevant factor in the\n       matter of construction of a contract. The\n       construction of the contract agreement is within\n       the jurisdiction of the arbitrators having regard\n       to the wide nature, scope and ambit of the\n       arbitration agreement and they cannot be said\n       to have misdirected themselves in passing the\n       award by taking into consideration the conduct\n       of   the    parties.    It   is   also   trite    that\n       correspondences exchanged by the parties are\n       required to be taken into consideration for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                        -39-</span>\n\n\n      purpose     of     construction   of   a   contract.\n      Interpretation of a contract is a matter for the\n      arbitrator to determine, even if it gives rise to\n      determination of a question of law. (See Pure\n      Helium India (P) Ltd. v. ONGC [(2003) 8 SCC 593]\n      and D.D. Sharma v. Union of India [(2004) 5 SCC\n      325]).\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">      113. Once, thus, it is held that the arbitrator had\n      the jurisdiction, no further question shall be\n      raised and the court will not exercise its\n      jurisdiction unless it is found that there exists\n      any bar on the face of the award.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">44. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1082846\" id=\"span_77\">In <a href=\"/doc/1082846/\" id=\"a_106\">MSK Projects (I) (JV) Ltd. v.

If the arbitrator commits an error in the\n      construction of the contract, that is an error within his\n      jurisdiction. But if he wanders outside the contract and\n      deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits a\n      jurisdictional error. Extrinsic evidence is admissible in\n      such cases because the dispute is not something which\n      arises under or in relation to the contract or dependent\n      on the construction of the contract or to be determined\n      within the award. The ambiguity of the award can, in\n      such cases, be resolved by admitting extrinsic evidence.\n      The rationale of this rule is that the nature of the\n      dispute is something which has to be determined\n      outside and independent of what appears in the award.\n      Such a jurisdictional error needs to be proved by\n      evidence extrinsic to the award.

Further, what is important to note is that the claim, as\n  preferred by the Contractor as well as claim preferred by the Railways,\n  were also specified in two annexures appended with the said letters.\n  Annexure &quot;A&quot; referred to the claim made by the Contractor and Annexure\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">  -&quot;B&quot; referred to the counter claim made by the Railways.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_117\">  However, while submitting statement of claim before the Arbitrator, the\n  Claimant-Contractor added some more claims, in addition to claims already\n  made at the time of demanding arbitration, as <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_139\">referred to above</a>. Additional\n  claims were itemized as Claim Item No.1, 3, 8 (a &amp; b) and 11. The\n  respondents, however, objected to such inclusion, seeking the Arbitrator to\n  rule on its own jurisdiction on such an objection, under <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 16</a> of the\n  Act of 1996. At that stage, however, the Arbitrator did not decide the issue.\n  At the time of passing the Award, the Arbitrator, however, wrote that as far\n  as additional claims No. 1, 3, 8 (a &amp; b) and 11 are concerned, as they did\n  not form part of original claim by the Claimant/Contractor while\n  demanding arbitration nor were included in Annexure -A of letter dated\n  27.7.2009 (I-16) were outside the scope of its jurisdiction. According to the\n  Arbitrator, as additional claims were not referred for adjudication and it\n  was not supplemental to other claims, therefore, it was beyond its\n  jurisdiction. The Commercial Court on this aspect, relying upon the decision\n  in the case of Praveen Enterprises (supra), held that the ruling of the\n  Arbitrator is against the terms of the contract and is against the public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                       -47-</span>\n\n\n  policy of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_105\">24.In one of the authoritative pronouncement of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, in\n  the case of <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_141\">Mcdermott International</a> (supra), scheme of Arbitration\n  adjudication under the Act of 1996 was considered in great detail on\n  various aspects.

We may elaborate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">                      (a) If an arbitration agreement provides that all\n               disputes between the parties relating to the contract\n               (some agreements may refer to some exceptions) shall\n               be referred to arbitration and that the decision of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                       -48-</span>\n\n\narbitrator shall be final and binding, the `reference&#x27;\ncontemplated is the act of parties to the arbitration\nagreement, referring their disputes to an agreed\narbitrator to settle the disputes.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">       (b) If an arbitration agreement provides that in\nthe event of any dispute between the parties, an\nauthority named therein shall nominate the arbitrator\nand refer the disputes which required to be settled by\narbitration, the `reference&#x27; contemplated is an act of\nthe appointing authority referring the disputes to the\narbitrator appointed by him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">       (c) Where the parties fail to concur in the\nappointment of arbitrator/s as required by the\narbitration agreement, or the authority named in the\narbitration   agreement      failing   to    nominate    the\narbitrator and refer the disputes raised to arbitration\nas required by the arbitration agreement, on an\napplication by an aggrieved party, the court can\nappoint the arbitrator and on such appointment, the\ndisputes between the parties stand referred to such\narbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_120\">11. Reference to arbitration can be in respect of all\ndisputes between the parties or all disputes regarding\na contract or in respect of specific enumerated\ndisputes. Where `all disputes&#x27; are referred, the\narbitrator has the jurisdiction to decide all disputes\nraised in the pleadings (both claims and counter\nclaims) subject to any limitations placed by the\narbitration   agreement.       Where        the   arbitration\nagreement provides that all disputes shall be settled\nby arbitration but excludes certain matters from\narbitration, then, the arbitrator will exclude the\nexcepted matter and decide only those disputes which\nare arbitrable. But where the reference to the\narbitrator is to decide specific disputes enumerated by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                      -49-</span>\n\n\n                the parties/court/appointing authority, the arbitrator&#x27;s\n                jurisdiction is circumscribed by the specific reference\n                and the arbitrator can decide only those specific\n                disputes.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">25.The effect of provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 23 (3)</a> of the Act of 1996 was\n   also considered in the said decision (Praveen Enterprises). Before referring\n   to the observation, it is apposite to reproduce <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 23</a> of the Act of 1996,\n   which relates to filing of statement of claim and defence, as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">                &quot;23.

The claimant\nis not bound to restrict his statement of claim to the\nclaims already raised by him by notice, &quot;unless the\nparties have otherwise agreed as to the required\nelements&quot; of such claim statement. It is also made\nclear that &quot;unless otherwise agreed by the parties&quot; the\nclaimant can also subsequently amend or supplement\nthe claims in the claim statement. That is, unless the\narbitration agreement requires the Arbitrator to\ndecide only the specifically referred disputes, the\nclaimant can while filing the statement of claim or\nthereafter, amend or add to the claims already made.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">27. Similarly <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_147\">section 23</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_148\">section 2(9)</a> makes\nit clear that a respondent is entitled to raise a counter\nclaim &quot;unless the parties have otherwise agreed&quot; and\nalso add to or amend the counter claim, &quot;unless\notherwise agreed&quot;. In short, unless the arbitration\nagreement requires the Arbitrator to decide only the\nspecifically referred disputes, the respondent can file\ncounter claims and amend or add to the same, except\nwhere    the    arbitration    agreement        restricts   the\narbitration    to   only     those   disputes     which     are\nspecifically referred to arbitration, both the claimant\nand respondent are entitled to make any claims or\ncounter claims and further entitled to add to or\namend such claims and counter claims provided they\nare arbitrable and within limitation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">29. Where the arbitration agreement requires the\ndisputes to be formulated and referred to arbitration\nby an appointing authority, and the appointing\nauthority fails to do so, the Chief Justice or his\ndesignate will direct the appointing authority to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                     -51-</span>\n\n\nformulate the disputes for reference as required by\nthe arbitration agreement.

This would mean that a respondent\ncan file a counter claim giving the facts supporting the\ncounter claim, the points at issue and the relief or\nremedy sought in that behalf and the claimant (who is\nthe respondent in the counter claim) will be entitled\nto file his defence to such counter claim. Once the\nclaims and counter claims are before the arbitrator,\nthe arbitrator will decide whether they fall within the\nscope of the arbitration agreement and whether he\nhas jurisdiction to adjudicate on those disputes\n(whether they are claims or the counter claims) and if\nthe answer is in the affirmative, proceed to adjudicate\nupon the same.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                     -52-</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1313207\" id=\"span_112\">31.

In view of the fact that reference to\n                      arbitrator was made by this Court in an appeal\n                      arising out of refusal to stay the suit under\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act and their\n                      reference was made of all disputes between the\n                      parties in the suit, the occasion to make a\n                      counter-claim in the written statement could\n                      arise only after the order of reference. The\n                      pleadings of the parties were filed before the\n                      arbitrator, and the reference covered all\n                      disputes between the parties in the suit.\n                      Accordingly, the counter-claim could not be\n                      made at any earlier stage. Refusal to consider\n                      the counter- claim for the only reason given in\n                      the award does, therefore, disclose an error of\n                      law apparent on the face of the award.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">                                                       (emphasis supplied)&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">27.The aforesaid principles <a href=\"/doc/1313207/\" id=\"a_159\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court and the provision\n   contained in <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 23 (3)</a> of the Act of 1996 are, therefore, required to be\n   applied to the facts of the present case, particularly with reference to the\n   relevant terms and conditions contained in the contract, with regard to\n   arbitration.

The award of the arbitrator\n                shall be final and binding on the parties to this\n                contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">28.A rational, logical and fair interpretation of the said clause reveals that any\n   question, dispute or difference is required to be referred to sole Arbitrator\n   to be appointed by the authority specified in the said clause. The\n   arbitration clause, on its close reading, does not provide for reference of a\n   particular dispute to the Arbitrator, for adjudication. This clause is akin to\n   the clause which was under consideration before the Supreme Court in the\n   case of Praveen Enterprises (supra). The agreement in this case provides\n   that any dispute between the parties, relating to contract, except the\n   Excepted Matters, shall be referred to arbitration. It is not a case where the\n   arbitration agreement provide that in the event of any dispute between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                      -54-</span>\n\n\n   parties, any authority named therein shall nominate the Arbitrator and\n   refer the dispute required to be settled by the Arbitrator so as to say that\n   &quot;The Reference&quot; contemplated is an act of the appointing authority\n   referring the disputes to the arbitrator appointed by him. Therefore,\n   present case falls in the category of those cases where reference to the\n   Arbitrator is in respect of all dispute between the parties and not in respect\n   of any specific enumerated dispute. Where all disputes are referred, the\n   Arbitrator has the jurisdiction to decide all disputes raised in the pleadings\n   which is subject only to any limitation placed by the arbitration agreement\n   itself. Unless it is a case where reference to Arbitrator is to decide specific\n   dispute, the arbitration jurisdiction is not circumscribed by specific\n   reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">29.<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 23 (3)</a> of the Act of 1996 otherwise entitles either party to the\n   arbitration to amend or supplement his claim or defence during the course\n   of arbitral proceedings. This is, however, subject to there being any\n   agreement to the contrary, between the parties. We could not find any\n   contrary clause in the contract, between the parties, which expressly or by\n   necessary implication provides otherwise, so as to say that once a\n   reference is made on certain claims, the parties to the agreement shall not\n   be entitled to add or supplement their claims. Present is not a case where\n   the Arbitrator, for any other valid reason, considered it inappropriate to\n   allow the amendment or supplement the claim having regard to delay in\n   making the same. In fact, such situation could not arise because the\n   claimant -contractor, from the beginning, while submitting statement of\n   claim raised additional claim. The only reason operative for refusing the\n   adjudication upon additional claims No. 1, 3, 8 (a &amp; b) and 11 was that it\n   does not contain claim for arbitration in the demand for arbitration and not\n   referred to the Arbitrator for the reason that in Annexure-&quot;A&quot; attached to\n   letter dated 27.7.2009 (I-16), these additional claims were not mentioned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">30.The provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 23</a> of the Act of 1996 creates statutory\n   right in favour of the Claimant or even in favour of Defendant to amend or\n   supplement their claim or counter claim during the course of arbitral\n   proceedings. There are only two statutory conditions when such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                      -55-</span>\n\n\n   entitlement is not available.

The right created by the statute to amend or supplement the\n   claim or counter claim could be taken away only in the manner prescribed\n   in the Act and under no other circumstance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1313207\" id=\"span_116\">As held in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1313207/\" id=\"a_163\">Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. vs. Amritsar\n   Gas Service and Ors.</a> (1991) 1 SCC 533 , refusal to consider the claim only\n   for that reason is a patent illegality being an error of law apparent on the\n   face of Award. (Para-15 of the aforesaid report has already been referred to\n   hereinabove, contained in para-31 of the Judgment in the case of Praveen\n   Enterprises.) Therefore, the finding of the Commercial Court in this regard\n   does not warrant any interference.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">   Consideration on Issue- &quot;C&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_132\">31.As far as Arbitrator&#x27;s finding regarding breach of contract is concerned,\n   learned counsel for Union of India vehemently argued before this Court\n   that while arriving at the finding, the Arbitrator has not taken into\n   consideration that the only contractual obligation on the part of Union of\n   India was to sponsor primary and then, secondary source of supply of\n   special cement and not to ensure the supply of special cement. If, for some\n   reason, the source of supply could not make full supply, it could not be\n   treated to be a breach of agreement by the Railways. It was also the case of\n   Union of India that the reason for short supply of sleepers was not linked\n   to short supply of cement but reduction of production capacity which was\n   reduced from three shifts to two shifts. In this regard, clause (3) of the their\n   reply was not considered. Further argument of learned counsel for Union\n   of India is that even if the sponsored primary or secondary source, for\n   some reason, failed to supply special cement, it would not be a case of\n   breach of contract by Union of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">   After going through the Award, we find that the Arbitrator has meticulously\n   examined this aspect relating to alleged breach, by taking into\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                  -56-</span>\n\n\nconsideration the submissions as also oral and documentary evidence on\nrecord, affording full opportunity to both the parties. The finding in this\nregard is recorded while examining the claim No.2. The Arbitrator has\ntaken into consideration, the provision contained in clause 4.2 of the\ncontract relating to source and rate for procurement of special cement. It\nhas taken into consideration the claim of the Claimant that there was short\nand erratic supply of special cement required for manufacturing of sleepers\nduring January 2006 to August 2006 and May 2007 to August 2007 and that\nbecause of shortage of supply of special cement from primary and\nsecondary source appointed by the respondent, the contractor was forced\nto slow down production resulting in losses on three accounts, namely, rise\nin price of the inputs, higher transportation charges as also idling charges\nof labour, establishment, machinery. It has taken into consideration the\nfactual aspect of the case that as both the source nominated by Railways\ncould not supply cement as per requirement, a third source of supply was\nnominated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_134\">In its finding recorded in clause (g) onwards, the Arbitrator has not only\ntaken into consideration the correspondences wherein the Claimant was\nconsistently representing against short supply of cement but also\nrespondent&#x27;s letter indicating failure of cement supply, addressed to the\nCement Supplier, expressing their serious concern. The Arbitrator has also\ntaken into consideration the admitted facts flowing on the surface of the\ncase that nomination, one after the other, were being made to sponsored\nsource of supply but that they were failing to supply cement in requisite\nquantity. The Arbitrator has taken into consideration the contractual\nrequirement of supply of sleepers, corresponding quantity of special\ncement required for manufacture of sleepers, approximation in terms of\ntime for manufacture of sleepers with maintained supply of particular\nquantity of cement, statement of daily progress mechanism, daily\nproduction records, provision contained in clause 15.2 of the contract and\nstatement submitted by respondent including records of receipt of total\ncement as also supply of sleepers, to come to the conclusion that the\nContractor could not manufacture the sleepers due to such short supply of\ncement from nominated source which fell short by 77583 sleepers, on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                      -57-</span>\n\n\n   account of disruption of cement supply. The respondent-Union of India\n   (Railways) completely oblivious of fact that it had become impossible for\n   the Claimant- Supplier to maintain supply of requisite number of sleepers\n   within the time stipulated for want of short supply of cement from\n   sponsored source, it proceeded to cancel the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_119\">On the aforesaid factual premise, oral and documentary evidence led by\n   the parties, finding of the Arbitrator can neither be said to be suffering\n   from any patent illegality or perversity or that it is in conflict with public\n   policy of India. Explanation-2 appended to <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 34 (2) (b) (ii)</a> provides\n   that the test as to whether there is a contravention with the fundamental\n   policy of Indian law shall not entail review on the merit of dispute. The\n   finding with regard to breach of contract is essentially a finding fact and in\n   the absence of permissible ground of review, exercise of supervisory\n   jurisdiction, as elaborately held by their Lordships in the Supreme Court in\n   the case of <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_165\">Associate Builders</a> (supra), the impugned order of the\n   Commercial Court refusing to interfere with the Arbitrator&#x27;s finding on the\n   aspect of breach of contract by the respondent, warrants no interference.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">   Consideration on Issue-&quot;D&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">32.The Arbitrator has rejected claims No.4,5,7 &amp;10 raised by the contractor.\n   Learned Commercial Court on this aspect has not interfered with the\n   finding of the Arbitrator in this regard. Claim No.4 (claim on account of\n   erroneous and faulty price variation formula) is essentially based on\n   negation and denial of specific condition of contract regarding price\n   variation clause as contained in clause - 14 of the agreement between the\n   parties. The entire claim of the Claimant in this regard is based on the\n   submission that the price variation clause itself is not just, proper, fair and\n   reasonable and against similar price variation clause in other agreements.\n   According to the Claimant, the price variation formula, as contained in the\n   agreement itself was erroneous as it does not adequately compensate the\n   parties in the event of rise or fall in the market price of the material\n   component to be used for the manufacture of sleepers. According to the\n   Claimant, price variation clause suffered from certain inherent defect and\n   on account of such faulty valuation in the price variation formula, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                    -58-</span>\n\n\n  impact of variation of the components is not truly compensated in the\n  updated rates of sleeper and the formula derives unreliable and irregular\n  rates. The part of claim No. 4, as contained in statement of claim, proceeds\n  only on such reasoning which only seeks to deny the contractual obligation.\n  In other words, the claim is based not on the agreed terms and condition of\n  price variation formula but based on a claim for price fixation, in complete\n  contravention and deviation from the specific, clear and unambiguous\n  price variation clauses contained in agreement and therefore, the\n  Arbitrator in recording that such a claim would not be tenable, does not\n  suffer from any perversity or patent illegality much less against any juristic\n  principles. It has been an argument advanced on behalf of the Claimant\n  that such a clause is otherwise unfair, arbitrary and unreasonable. We are\n  afraid, in a commercial dispute, be it between the State and individual, such\n  a ground could at all be pressed into service to wriggle out of the\n  contractual terms and condition. Present is not a case where this Court is\n  called upon to examine the reasonability or fairness of the terms of\n  agreement in public law domain on account of contractual dispute having\n  arisen between the State on one hand and a private individual on the other.\n  It being a case of contractual dispute, the rights and obligations of the\n  parties are required to be determined strictly in accordance with the terms\n  of the contract and the applicable laws of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_138\">33.In so far as claim No.5 i.e. the claim for deduction on account of VAT\n  component of special cement is concerned, the said claim has been denied\n  taking into consideration the specific clause 4.2 of the agreement. The\n  Arbitrator has recorded finding that as per clause 4.2 of the agreement, the\n  respondent is authorized to nominate the source of supply of cement for\n  manufacturing of sleepers. The Claimant&#x27;s claim in this regard appears to\n  be based on the premise that the present contract was opened before the\n  implementation of VAT system of tax by all the State Govt. in the country\n  and under the new tax regime, if manufacturer procures special cement\n  from outside the State for its manufacturing unit, he has to pay central\n  sales tax for which there is no reimbursement and is added loss to him. As\n  per statement of claim, clause 14.4 in the contract providing for VAT credit\n  per sleeper to be passed on to the purchaser termed as &quot;V&quot;, would be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                                     -59-</span>\n\n\n   applicable only in case the input material is procured from within the State.\n   Because in such cases, the manufacturer is reimbursed towards VAT\n   applicable on the special cement. The claim, however is based, again, on\n   the submission that the formula provided in clause 14.4 of the agreement\n   for calculation of VAT credit per sleeper on account of special cement, does\n   not justify the intention of the contract and in its operation, computes the\n   VAT credit on special cement on a far higher value.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_139\">   It would, thus, be seen that the entire claim in this regard is based not on\n   any alleged breach of any contract but the claim itself is in breach of\n   contractual terms and condition. This benefit claimed by the Claimant\n   could not be granted unless the tax formula, as provided in clause 14.4. of\n   the agreement, itself is altered and modified. The finding recorded by the\n   Arbitrator in this regard, which essentially are based on construction of the\n   clause of agreement, do not warrant any interference in the absence of any\n   ground of patent illegality or perversity made out. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77286517\" id=\"span_122\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/77286517/\" id=\"a_166\">National\n   Highways Authority of India Vs. ITD Cementation India Limited</a> (2015)\n   14 SCC 21, it has been authoritatively pronounced that the construction of\n   terms and condition of contract is for Arbitrator to decide even if it gives\n   rise to determination of a question of law and that Arbitrator is entitled to\n   take the view which it holds to be correct. Where the Arbitrator construes\n   terms and condition of contract in a reasonable manner, there will be no\n   occasion to set aside the Award.</span> The interference of the Court would be\n   called only in case of perverse interpretation i.e. one which is construed as\n   something that no fair minded or reasonable person could do.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">   The Court exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 34</a> of the Act are certainly\n   not invested with the power to act as a Court of appeal to re-appreciate the\n   merits of the case even when it relates to construction of terms and\n   conditions of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_141\">34.We take exception to the manner in which the Arbitrator has dealt with this\n   claim No.7. The claim for faulty demand of demurrage charges is\n   essentially based on computation of allotted time for loading sleepers in a\n   rake by respondent. According to Claimant, respondent have wrongly\n   classified the loading process &quot;mechanized&quot;, thereby allotting only six hours\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                   -60-</span>\n\n\nfor loading and have also not given this loading time in each placement of\nthe part-rake and have alloted time for the full rake.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_142\">According to the Claimant, the loading process has to be considered as\n&quot;manual&quot; loading owing to the processes to be followed as per clause 10.2\nof the Contract as specified drawing of the contract and the specified\ndrawing, requiring wooden battens to be placed between sleepers, all of\nwhich necessitated the use of manual labour. The Claimant has further\nsought to fortify his claim on the premise that use of gantries (cranes) for\nlifting as well as placement of sleeper on Railway Wagons requires manual\nlabour. In support of this claim, the Claimant has heavily relied upon a\ncertificate issued by the Commercial Department of the respondent which\nconsiders loading of sleepers in the Claimant&#x27;s unit &quot;Manual&quot; providing\nloading time of seven hours for each placement in sleeper plants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">To this, Respondent denial is based on clause 10.3 of the agreement under\nwhich the responsibility is entirely on the Claimant to arrange for prompt\nloading.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">Clause 10.3 of the agreement, as it reads, does not specify that the loading\ntime would be 6 hours or that the process of loading in the present case\nwas invariably to be treated as mechanical and not manual. The relevant\nclause 10 of the agreement reads as below :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">             &quot;10. Dispatch:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">             10.1.

The responsibility for damages or losses en\n             route will be to the account of the purchaser only for\n             consignment booked against clear RRs or against\n             certificate as per clause 10.3 above.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">We do not find that there is any stipulation in the present case that loading\nwould be treated as manual or mechanical or that the Claimant will have to\napply mechanical process only nor is there any specific clause that only six\nhours would be provided for each rake loading.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">This essentially, therefore, was a matter for determination by the Arbitrator\nin the light of pleadings, oral and documentary evidence led by the parties\nfirstly as to whether in the present case, the process of loading was manual\nor it was mechanized and secondly whether it was implied condition of the\ncontract that the Claimant will have to undertake loading at the rate of six\nhours per rake. The Arbitrator, as we notice, has not decided anything. All\nthat it has stated is that as per clause 10.3 of the agreement, it was entirely\nthe responsibility of the Claimant to arrange for prompt loading and that\nthe demurrage charges are levied as per extent rules of Commercial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                        -62-</span>\n\n\n   Department. Curiously enough, the Arbitrator further records as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">                ...&quot;Since matter involves policy issue related\n                commercial department of Railway, it cannot be\n                decided by the Tribunal. Tribunal therefore\n                directs   that    &quot;Claimant      shall    make      the\n                representation    in    detail   &amp;   same   shall   be\n                forwarded    by     Respondent       to   Commercial\n                Department for deciding the issue on merits as\n                per extend rules&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">   This kind of direction for decision of representation, if we may say so, was\n   completely outside the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator was\n   called upon to adjudicate the claim on the basis of pleadings, material and\n   documentary evidence and the terms of contract between the parties and\n   not to issue a direction for consideration of their representation. In our\n   considered opinion, this is not only patently illegal but is a case where the\n   Arbitrator has failed to decide the issue one way or the other and only\n   conveniently brushed aside, certainly calling for interference in exercise of\n   supervisory jurisdiction conferred on the Court. The finding recorded by\n   learned Commercial Court on claim No.7, therefore, cannot be sustained in\n   law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">35.As far as claim No.10, which relates to claim for supply beyond delivery\n   period, is concerned, it has also not been decided only on the ground that\n   payment for sleeper manufactured beyond original contract period has\n   already been paid by the respondent and accepted by the Claimant without\n   any objection. The finding in this regard cannot be said to be based on any\n   material. On what basis the Arbitrator came to the conclusion that the\n   payment for sleepers manufactured beyond original contract period, made\n   by the respondent, was accepted without any demeanour or protest, is not\n   contained anywhere in the Award. Finding that payment was accepted\n   without any objection is perverse. Moreover, the Arbitrator had not\n   examined the legal position with regard to tenability of the claim even\n   when payment was accepted without any objection. The finding is not only\n   perverse but suffers from patent illegality and jurisdictional flaw in as much\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                       -63-</span>\n\n\n   as, conclusion has been arrived at without linked to any reason and\n   material for such conclusion. The Arbitrator&#x27;s finding on claim No.10,\n   therefore cannot be sustained in law and is accordingly set aside.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">   Consideration on Issue- &quot;E&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">36.The Arbitrator&#x27;s decision to exclude from the purview of arbitration\n   adjudication, Claimant&#x27;s claim No.1,3, 8 (a &amp; b) &amp; 11 has been found to be\n   suffering from patent illegality by the Commercial Court in the impugned\n   order, which finding has also been affirmed by this Court.

It was held that in\n   case of breach of contract, the party who suffers by such breach, is entitled\n   to be compensated for the loss or damage caused to it by such breach, and\n   therefore, the award is ex-facie erroneous and in conflict with public policy\n   of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">37.While learned counsel appearing for the Claimant/Supplier- M/s.

In a recent judicial pronouncement in the case of Maharashtra State\n\n  Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. Vs. M/s.

That apart, we also find that the Arbitral\n              Tribunal, while awarding the damages, has relied\n              upon the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/274570/\" id=\"a_181\">Union of India &amp;\n              Ors. v. Sugauli Sugar Works (P) Ltd.</a> wherein a\n              cardinal principle of damages had been laid down to\n              the effect that the injured party should be placed in\n              as good a position as money could do as if the\n              contract had been performed. Following passage\n              from <a href=\"/doc/274570/\" id=\"a_182\">the said judgment</a> was kept in mind by the\n              Arbitral Tribunal:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">                     &quot;22. The market rate is a presumptive test\n                     because it is the general intention of the law\n                     that, in giving damages, for breach of contract,\n                     the party complaining should, so far as it can\n                     be done by money, be placed in the same\n                     position as he would have been in if the\n                     contract had been performed. The rule as to\n                     market price is intended to secure only an\n                     indemnity to the purchaser. The market value\n                     is taken because it is presumed to be the true\n                     value of the goods to the purchaser. One of\n                     the principles for award of damages is that as\n                     far as possible he who has proved a breach of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                     -66-</span>\n\n\n      a bargain to supply what he has contracted to\n      get is to be placed as far as money can do it, in\n      as good a situation as if the contract had been\n      performed. The fundamental basis thus is\n      compensation for the pecuniary loss which\n      naturally flows from the breach. Therefore, the\n      principle is that as far as possible the injured\n      party should be placed in as good a situation\n      as if the contract had been performed. In\n      other words, it is to provide compensation for\n      pecuniary loss which naturally flows from the\n      breach. The High Court correctly applied these\n      principles and adopted the contract price in\n      the facts and circumstances of the case as the\n      correct basis for compensation.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">62. In the aforesaid backdrop, we agree with the\napproach of the High Court in spelling out the\nproposition of law that once it is established that the\nparty was justified in terminating the contract on\naccount of fundamental breach thereof, then the\nsaid innocent party is entitled to claim damages for\nthe entire contract, i.e. for the part which is\nperformed and also for the part of the contract\nwhich it was prevented from performing. We may\nusefully refer to the following dicta <a href=\"/doc/274570/\" id=\"a_183\">laid down in</a>\nSuisse Atlantique Societe d&#x27;Armament SA v. NV\nRotterdamsche Kolen Centrale:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">           &quot;...if facts of that kind could be proved I\n      think it would be open to the arbitrators to\n      find that the respondents had committed a\n      fundamental or repudiatory breach. One way\n      of looking at the matter would be to ask\n      whether the party in breach has by his breach\n      produced a situation fundamentally different\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                       -67-</span>\n\n\n                      from anything which the parties could as\n                      reasonable men have contemplated when the\n                      contract was made. Then one would have to\n                      ask not only what had already happened but\n                      also what was likely to happen in future. And\n                      there the fact that the breach was deliberate\n                      might be of great importance.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">                           If fundamental breach is established the\n                      next question is what effect, if any, that has on\n                      the applicability of other terms of the contract.\n                      This question has often arisen with regard to\n                      clauses excluding liability, in whole or in part,\n                      of the party in breach. I do not think that there\n                      is generally much difficulty where the innocent\n                      party has elected to treat the breach as a\n                      repudiation, bring the contract to an end and\n                      sue for damages. Then the whole contract has\n                      ceased to exist, including the exclusion clause,\n                      and I do not see how that clause can then be\n                      used to exclude an action for loss which will\n                      be suffered by the innocent party after it has\n                      ceased to exist, such as loss of the profit which\n                      would have accrued if the contract had run its\n                      full term...&quot;             (emphasis supplied)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">39. Present is admittedly not a case that the contract between the parties\n\n   contained any specific term under which the parties agreed otherwise that\n   in the event of breach of contract, even if a party suffers any loss or\n   damage, either no such claim shall be made or that liability for such claim\n   shall be limited in a particular manner. Though, present case does not\n   given an occasion to decide whether such stipulation in a contract could at\n   all be enforced, in the factual context of present case, in the absence of\n   there being any such stipulation, the rights and obligations of the party\n   would obviously be governed by provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_184\">Contract Act</a>, including\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                       -68-</span>\n\n\n  those which relate to right of compensation in case of breach of contract,\n  as has been provided in <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_185\">Sections 73</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_186\">74</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/419408/\" id=\"a_187\">75</a> of the Contract Act. The\n  aforesaid provisions have to be read into the agreement between the\n  parties.

In   the    said   decision,   V.\n  Ramasubramanian, J. interpreted that <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996\n  empowers the Court to modify, revise or vary the award. To come to this\n  conclusion, reliance has been placed on certain judicial trend reflected\n  from the decision of the Supreme Court as well as Bombay and Delhi High\n  Court. True it is that in some of the decisions of the Supreme Court,\n  wherein the Supreme Court, dealing with the matter arising out of\n  arbitration award, modified the award and so also ordered by the Bombay\n  and Delhi High Court. Based on this judicial trend, power to modify, revise\n  or vary the award was read into <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_134\">Observation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                      -69-</span>\n\n\n   made in the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_190\">Mcdermott\n   International</a> (supra) were also noted but as all other decisions of the\n   Supreme Court referred to in this decision have either modified the award\n   or approved the modification of the award by the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 34</a> of\n   the Act of 1996, it was concluded that it is permissible to modify, revise or\n   vary the award.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_136\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"157353738\" id=\"span_137\">43.

The\n   whole scheme of the Act, including the nature of jurisdiction exercisable by\n   the Court under the Act of 1996 was also minutely examined. Following\n   legal principles were postulated :-</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">                &quot;52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory\n                role of courts, for the review of the arbitral award\n                only to ensure fairness. Intervention of the court is\n                envisaged in few circumstances only, like, in case of\n                fraud or bias by the arbitrators, violation of natural\n                justice, etc. The court cannot correct errors of the\n                arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving the\n                parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is\n                desired. So, scheme of the provision aims at keeping\n                the supervisory role of the court at minimum level\n                and this can be justified as parties to the agreement\n                make a conscious decision to exclude the court&#x27;s\n                jurisdiction by opting for arbitration as they prefer\n                the expediency and finality offered by it.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                -70-</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">             What has been propounded by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid decision\n             is Law declared under Article 141 of the Constitution, which is binding on\n             us.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\">          44.The aforesaid authoritative pronouncement that &quot;the Court cannot correct\n             errors of the Arbitrators, it can only quash the award leaving the parties\n             free to begin the arbitration again if it is desired&quot; does not allow the\n             Commercial Court exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1219022/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 34</a> of the Act of\n             1996 nor this Court to modify or correct the award.
