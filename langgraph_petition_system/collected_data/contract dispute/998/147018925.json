The said tender work\n\nwas for a total consideration of Rs.7,03,78,267/- which came to\n\nbe accepted by respondent authority by issuing a letter of intent\n\ndated 05.05.2000 and thereby the respondent authority called\n\nupon the petitioner to execute an agreement and to deposit an\n\namount towards security deposit. On 12.06.2000, an agreement\n\ncame to be executed bearing No. SSP/B-2/7 of 2001-2002 and as\n\nper the requirement upon deposit of security amount the Work\n\nOrder also came to be issued on 29.06.2000. Petitioner pursuant\n\nto it mobilized the manpower and machinery to complete the\n\nwork within the time scheduled as prescribed under the contract.\n\nHowever,        delay   has   occasioned        on    account         of     various\n\ncircumstances and the work ultimately could not be completed\n\nwithin stipulated time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 Page 3 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                            Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                           CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\n\n[2.1] It is the case of the petitioner that respondent herein as a\n\nresult of which decided to withdraw remaining tender work from\n\nthe petitioner to assign the same to third party at the risk and\n\ncost of the petitioner and to that effect a letter was\n\ncommunicated to the petitioner on 12.08.2005.                   Petitioner\n\nrequested the respondent vide letter dated 08.10.2005 to revoke\n\nthe decision as it was inclined to carryout the remaining portion\n\nof work. Later on, the said request was accepted by respondent\n\nauthority and permitted the petitioner to complete the remaining\n\ntender work as intimated by communication dated 01.12.2005\n\nsubject to the condition that petitioner would not claim price\n\nescalation during the period of completion of remaining tender\n\nwork after the original date of completion under the contract. So\n\nmuch so, petitioner was asked to furnish an undertaking to that\n\neffect which also came to be forwarded and later on despite\n\nresistance and obstruction of the farmers / landowners and all\n\nother contingencies the work was processed but on account of\n\nthe said circumstances vide letter dated 15.01.2007, the\n\npetitioner was constrained to make a further request for\n\nenlargement of time for completion of remaining portion of work.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                             Page 4 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                   Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                                       CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nIt was also requested that since the circumstances were not\n\nrelated to the petitioner in completion of work and the delay has\n\noccurred       on      account    of     respondent&#x27;s       default,        petitioner\n\nrequested the respondent to consider the petitioner&#x27;s request to\n\npay price escalation but finally on 04.06.2007 the respondent\n\nagreed to grant an extension to the petitioner and according to\n\nthe petitioner also agreed to consider the request for price\n\nescalation subject to furnishing the evidence.                              The said\n\ncircumstances, according to the petitioner, are reflected in\n\nletters dated 15.01.2007 and 04.06.2007.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n[2.2] It is further the case of the petitioner that surprisingly vide\n\ncommunication dated 27.08.2007 the respondent terminated the\n\ncontract      itself     and     informed         the   petitioner        that       final\n\nmeasurement will commence on 10.09.2007 and to this, the\n\npetitioner raised strong objection in the form of letter dated\n\n10.09.2007 raising protest against the termination of contract\n\nand sought for release of the outstanding payment along with\n\nprice escalation.          In response to this, vide letter dated\n\n06.02.2010, the respondent proposed to debar the petitioner\n\nfrom all its tender works as a result of this, a specific objection\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                       Page 5 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                               Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                           CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nhas been raised against such proposed action of debarring vide\n\ndetail communication dated 08.02.2010 and also incidentally\n\nrequested to grant an opportunity of hearing before taking any\n\naction in that direction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n[2.3] It is further the case of the petitioner that on 24.02.2010,\n\nthe respondent called upon the petitioner to attend the meeting\n\nwith the Joint Managing Director (Finance) on 25.05.2010. The\n\npetitioner remained present and voiced out the grievances\n\nbefore the authority and in the said meeting, the Deputy General\n\nManager and the Chief Engineer, Canals-1 were also present and\n\nthey, according to petitioner, have accepted that there was some\n\ndelay on the part of respondent in providing structure drawings\n\nand providing land to the petitioner and also accepted that they\n\ncould not provide requisite borrow areas to the petitioner due to\n\nnon-availability. The said meeting resulted into an execution of\n\nSupplementary Contract Agreement dated 15.03.2010 and in the\n\nsaid agreement also it was specifically agreed, according to the\n\npetitioner, that balance payment for the work executed will be\n\npaid as per the original tender rate with price escalation at\n\nfrozen indices of April 2007.

The petitioner has\n\nsubmitted that even work completion certificate was also issued\n\non 31.12.2010 indicating satisfaction about the work which was\n\ncarried out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n[2.4] It is further the case of the petitioner that vide letter dated\n\n16.05.2011,         the   petitioner   claimed    specifically        the      price\n\nescalation as per the Supplementary Contract Agreement and\n\nalso claimed the payment of difference of star rate of cement\n\nand steel during the said period in view of Clause 57 of the\n\ncontract amounting to Rs.12,14,484/-. Several representations\n\nhave been made in this regard to the respondent but the\n\nrespondent refused to release the payment of price escalation,\n\neven as per the contract and went on repeating by indicating\n\nthat by virtue of such undertaking dated 13.01.2006 the request\n\nis not possible to be accepted.              The detailed representations\n\nhave been made time and again in this regard by the petitioner\n\nclarifying the entire situation that the undertaking which was\n\nalready given was in respect of a different situation but by virtue\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   Page 7 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                          Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nof fresh agreement the request deserves to be considered but\n\nrespondent once again vide communication dated 08.04.2021\n\nrejected the request which has again led the petitioner to make a\n\nfurther fresh representation on 15.05.2021 then again the\n\nauthority has not considered the case reiterated its early\n\ndecision in the from of fresh letter dated 28.06.2021. As a result\n\nof this, petitioner has approached this Court by way of present\n\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of the India.\n\n\n\n[3]    Pursuant to the notice having been issued, the respondent\n\nauthority has appeared, filed a detailed reply and as such upon\n\nrequest of both the learned advocates appearing for the\n\nrespective side, the matter is taken up for final hearing.\n\n\n\n[4]    Mr. Jaimin R. Dave, learned advocate appearing for the\n\npetitioner has vehemently contended that action of the\n\nrespondent authority is not only unjust and arbitrary but tainted\n\nwith mala fides. It has been contended that sole reason which\n\nhas been assigned for impugned action is that in the month of\n\nJanuary, 2006, the petitioner tendered an undertaking and as\n\nsuch it is not entitled to seek release of price escalation and star\n\nrate difference. It has been submitted that such undertaking has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                              Page 8 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                    Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                           CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nno role to play specially when the fresh contract came to be\n\nexecuted between parties to the proceedings and as such said\n\nagreement having been executed and after certifying the\n\ncompletion of work satisfactorily now when a difference of price\n\nescalation is to be made the authority has gone back to the year\n\n2006 and resorted to an undertaking which cannot be applied at\n\nall and hence, the action initiated by respondent is absolutely\n\narbitrarily, unreasonable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n[4.1] It has been contended by Mr. Dave, learned advocate\n\nappearing for the petitioner that it is not in dispute that work has\n\nbeen completed long back in December, 2010 for which the\n\nauthority has also issued a certificate which is reflecting on page\n\n159 (Annexure-M) and once having completed the work which\n\nwas allowed by the very same respondent authority it is now not\n\nopen for it to raise a plea of undertaking just to deny the benefit\n\nand as such the action is unsustainable in the eye of law.\n\n\n\n[4.2] Mr. Dave, learned advocate appearing for the petitioner\n\nhas further submitted that it is settled position of law that when\n\nthe action of authority is arbitrary, unreasonable and apparently\n\nnot sustainable the writ court always can exercise extraordinary\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                             Page 9 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                   Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\njurisdiction as held in catena of decisions and here is the case in\n\nwhich the background of facts would clearly indicate that action\n\nof authority under challenge is absolutely arbitrary. Hence, he\n\nhas prayed for issuance of writ in the context of relief which are\n\nsought for in the petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n[4.3] Mr. Dave, learned advocate has also submitted to\n\nstrengthen his argument by making a reference that undertaking\n\nwas given to the effect that petitioner will not seek nor raise\n\ngrievance with regard to price escalation during the period after\n\noriginal date of completion and the said undertaking dated\n\n13.01.2006 has lost its significance by virtue of Supplementary\n\nContract Agreement which came to be executed on 15.03.2010.\n\nThat being so apparently action is not sustainable.               A further\n\nreference is made to few of the conditions contained in\n\nSupplementary Contract Agreement reflecting at page 155\n\n(Annexure-L) and has submitted that a specific stipulation was\n\ncontained in the said contract that payment of balance work\n\nexecuted will be paid as per the original tender rate with price\n\nescalation at frozen indices of April 2007 and that being so, there\n\nis hardly any reason for authority to relate back to the\n\nundertaking of 2006. This supplementary contract is executed in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                              Page 10 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                                 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nthe month of March, 2010 with aforesaid rider.

It was stated in State of M.P. v. Nandlal (AIR 1987 SC\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">           251), that the High Court in exercise of its discretion does\n           not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent or the\n           acquiescent and the lethargic. If there is inordinate delay\n           on the part of the petitioner and such delay is not\n           satisfactorily explained, the High Court may decline to\n           intervene and grant relief in exercise of its writ jurisdiction.\n           It was stated that this rule is premised on a number of\n           factors. The High Court does not ordinarily permit a belated\n           resort to the extraordinary remedy because it is likely to\n           cause confusion and public inconvenience and bring, in its\n           train new injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is exercised after\n           unreasonable delay, it may have the effect of inflicting not\n           only hardship and inconvenience but also injustice on third\n           parties. It was pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is\n           invoked, unexplained delay coupled with the creation of\n           third party rights in the meantime is an important factor\n           which also weighs with the High Court in deciding whether\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                   Page 28 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                            Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                                    CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\n            or not to exercise such jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">            10.       It has been pointed out by this Court in a number\n            of cases that representations would not be adequate\n            explanation to take care of delay. This was first stated in\n            K.V. Raja Lakshmiah v. State of Mysore (AIR 1967 SC 973).\n            This was re- iterated in R.N. Bose&#x27;s case (supra) by stating\n            that there is a limit to the time which can be considered\n            reasonable    for   making     representations     and      if   the\n            Government had turned down one representation the\n            making of another representation on similar lines will not\n            explain the delay. In State of Orissa v. P. Samantaraj (AIR\n            1976 SC 1617) making of repeated representations was not\n            regarded as satisfactory explanation of the delay. In that\n            case the petition had been dismissed for delay alone. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"977554\" id=\"span_63\">(See\n            <a href=\"/doc/977554/\" id=\"a_13\">State of Orissa v.

As a result of this, we are not in a position to\n\nignore the delay while arriving at final conclusion.\n\n\n\n[11] In addition to this, a perusal of the terms of original\n\ncontract agreement and the supplementary contract if to be co-\n\nrelated, the action may not be found to be so arbitrary which\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                    Page 29 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                                             Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nmay allow us to invoke extraordinary jurisdiction to grant the\n\nrelief sought for.    The original contract contains terms and\n\nconditions indicates that such a mammoth project which was\n\nentrusted to be undertaken by petitioner consisting of a huge\n\nestimated cost of Rs.823.66 lakhs was to be completed within\n\nthe period mentioned in the original contract and said contract\n\nspecifically being understood by the petitioner after careful study\n\nof the conditions of the contract specification, it is too late in the\n\nday to retrace the terms agreed to. The original contract also\n\ndealt with the issue related to indemnity as well as the\n\nrecoveries of the claim stipulated vide Clause 33 and by virtue of\n\nsaid Clause 33, the respondent is entitled to appropriate set off\n\nthe claim.</span> The said original contract also contains an arbitration\n\nclause which indicates that in the event of any dispute or\n\ndifference arising out of or in relation to the contract shall be\n\nreferred to arbitration Tribunal for arbitration constituted under\n\nthe provisions of the Gujarat Public Works Contract Dispute\n\nArbitration Tribunal Act, 1992 and the decision of the Tribunal\n\nwould be final and as such the petitioner has neither disclosed\n\ncogent reasons for inordinate delay in not approaching the Court\n\nnor has disclosed as to why till now has not redressed his\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                              Page 30 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                                     Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\ngrievance though statutory mode under the contract itself was\n\navailable hence this conspicuous silence over this much period\n\nalso not impossible to be ignored by us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">\n\n[12] Now, coming to the terms of the undertaking dated\n\n13.01.2006, reflected at page 138(A) given by petitioner indicate\n\nthat petitioner has agreed not to seek price escalation during the\n\nperiod after the original date of completion.             A perusal of\n\nSupplementary Contract Agreement indicate that after giving the\n\nopportunity and after considering the request of the petitioner,\n\nthe respondent has allowed the petitioner to complete the work\n\nof on certain conditions and the said contract dated 15.03.2010\n\nindicates that other terms and conditions of original contract will\n\nremain unchanged and        remaining work as per the original\n\ncontract is to be completed by the agency.            The reliance on\n\nClause 3 and 4 of said agreement placed by the petitioner could\n\nhave well been agitated before an appropriate forum already\n\nstipulated in the original terms as it is a disputed question of\n\nfact. On perusal of the aforesaid circumstances prevailing on\n\nrecord, we are of the opinion that petitioner was not remediless\n\nand it could have agitated or made an attempt to ventilate the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                             Page 31 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                                    Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                           CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\ngrievance after receiving back security deposit. However, after\n\nreceipt of the security deposit without any objection as well as\n\npayment under the final Running Account Bill it is loo late in the\n\nday to contend petitioner is entitled to escalated charged and\n\nthat too after 12 years. Hence, we are of the view that equitable\n\njurisdiction in this peculiar background does not deserve to be\n\nexercised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n[13] In the light of aforesaid chronology of events, we made a\n\npointed query to the petitioner&#x27;s counsel that what was the\n\nreason for remaining silent right from the year 2012 till 2021, he\n\ncandidly submitted that he was unable to explain the delay\n\nexcept stating that petitioner was pursuing its grievance before\n\nrespondent by submitting representations. Hence, we are of the\n\nopinion that delay and laches staring on the face of it cannot be\n\ngiven a go bye in present background.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n[14] Hence, we are not inclined to exercise our extraordinary\n\njurisdiction to grant the reliefs sought for.     There can be no\n\ndispute at all about the proposition that Writ Court cannot\n\nexercise the discretion despite the availability of statutory\n\nmechanism to ventilate the grievance and further it is also not in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                            Page 32 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                   Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\ndispute that no monetary relief can be granted in exercise of\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\nHowever, it all depends upon fact of each case. In the instant\n\ncase we have specifically noticed that after accepting the refund\n\nof security deposit and clearance of final RA Bill without any\n\ndemur after almost a decade an attempt is made by petitioner to\n\nseek the relief though the petitioner was quite aware about the\n\nfact that such grievance could have been raised at a relevant\n\npoint of time not only in view of the availability of specific forum\n\nbut also invoking the remedy under civil law.                 However, for\n\nreasons undisclosed in the present proceedings the petitioner\n\nhas not availed the said alternative remedies and upon query\n\nbeing raised about delay simple answer was that petitioner was\n\nmaking       continuous   representations      to   respondent.              This\n\nexplanation is not digestable in view of fact and as such when\n\nthese facts are quite apparent the decisions which have been\n\ntried to be relied upon are not possible to be applied to the facts\n\non hand. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125586420\" id=\"span_72\">Law of precedent is quite clear that one additional fact\n\nmay make a world of difference in applying the proposition.\n\nHence, having gone through the decision relied upon by the\n\npetitioner at length, we are unable to extend our hands of justice\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                               Page 33 of 35</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                                       Downloaded on : Thu Apr 21 20:51:10 IST 2022</span>\n  C/SCA/19500/2021                                    CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/04/2022\n\n\n\nto the petitioner. Hence, we refrain ourselves from exercising\n\nextraordinary jurisdiction in the present proceedings in the light\n\nof undisputed facts prevailing on record as discussed above.\n\n\n\n[15] At this stage, we may refer to the law <a href=\"/doc/977554/\" id=\"a_15\">laid down by</a> Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court last in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/125586420/\" id=\"a_16\">Uflex Limited versus\n\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu and others</a> reported in (2022) 1 SCC\n\n165 in which it has been made clear that judicial review in\n\ncontractual matters has its own limitation and it is invoked to\n\nprevent arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and\n\nmala fides.         The purpose is to check whether the choice of\n\ndecision is made lawfully and not to check whether the choice of\n\ndecision is sound.             Following observations contained in\n\nparagraph 2 reads thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">            &quot;2.
