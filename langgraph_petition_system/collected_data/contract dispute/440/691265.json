At the outset, a preliminary objection is raised by the learned Advocate General appearing for respondent No. 1 on caveat about maintainability of the present petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">4. The first petitioner is a Company incorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_11\">Companies Act, 1956</a>, and engaged in the business of operation of a container terminal at the port of Mundra. The second petitioner is a Director and shareholder of the first petitioner and is a citizen of India. Respondent No. 2 is licensed by respondent No. 1 to operate and run the Port of Mundra and is empowered under the CA dated 17.2.2001 to grant sub-concessions to parties for the purposes of development and operations of the Port of Mundra as per the terms and conditions laid down in the above CA.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.1 As per the record annexed with the petition, a frame-work agreement was entered into between the parties on 8.11.2002 in view of the certain stages contemplated under the SCA for the development and management of contracted assets. The first stage assets comprising of 632 meters quay wall in Navinal Creek and 38.48 hectares of the back up area came to be transferred to the petitioner on 18.7.2003 as stated earlier and achieved growth to the extent of 6 lacs TEUs per year. The SCA further envisaged transfer of second stage assets comprising of 618 meters quay wall and 19.633 hectares of back up area as per the Clauses of SCA. It is further to be noted that there was a non-compete provision vide Clause 17 read with Clause 11 of the SCA and Clauses 7 and 7.1 of F.A, which prohibited respondent No. 2 from developing or permitting the development of the container handling facility in the Port of Mundra save and except as per Clause 17. Earlier, FIPB granted approval for foreign collaborations vide letter dated 26.2.2003 on certain conditions.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.2 On the basis of the terms and conditions laid down in the CA, on or about 7.1.2003, as amended on 17.4.2003, GAPL, now MPSEZ, entered into SCA with the petitioner for operating and maintaining container terminal at the Port of Mundra and, as per the letter dated 10.5.2003 addressed by respondent No. 1 to respondent No. 2, the State of Gujarat had approved in principle the transaction of transfer of 100% equity shares of ACTL now MICTL to P&amp;O Mundra Ports. It was approved by the Government of Gujarat to allow GMB to grant permission to GAPL for transfer of quay wall [632 mt.length] to ACTL for container terminal under Clause 20(b) of the CA. It is to be noted that the above approval in principle was granted subject to execution of legally enforceable documents by respondent No. 2 and the shareholders of ACTL in respect of certain undertakings given vide letters dated 9th, 10th and 17th April 2003 and, in turn, the GMB granted permission to transfer 100% equity shares and quay wall for container terminal on certain conditions referred to later on.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">4.3 The conditions of letter dated 10.5.2003 were based on the conditions imposed by FIPB in its letter dated 26.2.2003 of approval of foreign collaborations as applied. It appears from the record that, by letter dated 2.8.2005, the GMB once again asked respondent No. 2 to comply with certain lacunas on the terms of letter dated 10.5.2003 and undertaking given by the petitioner pursuant thereto.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">4.4 Thereafter, the container terminal commenced operations on 18th July 2003 and handled increasing volumes of containers and, ultimately, the revenues collected from the container terminal have steadily increased from year to year and upto 31st October 2007, as per the unaudited report, it was Rs. 53540.75 lakhs.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">4.5 As per the requirement of the SCA, respondent No. 2 is entitled to royalty being 10% of the gross revenue earned by the first petitioner and also to collect water front royalty from the users and pay to respondent No. 2 for payment to respondent No. 1. Thus, according to the petitioners, royalty amounting to Rs. 5206.64 lakhs paid to respondent No. 2 and in turn water front royalty paid by respondent No. 2 to respondent No. 1 upto 31.10.2007 is Rs. 1207.79 lakhs. Therefore, according to the petitioners, the above arrangement worked smoothly and efficiently and there was no blockage and was a boon to the industry, trade and economy of the State of Gujarat and the country in general. Investment worth more than Rs. 400 crores is made and other commercial enterprises also depend on the terminal for their business since their revenue earnings is 10% per annum of the above investment.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">4.6 Later on, since respondent No. 2 commenced construction of container terminal at the Port of Mundra, which, according to the petitioner, was in breach of the above non-compete Clause 17 of the SCA and even the operations commenced sometime in August 2007, therefore, proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1549225/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation act, 1996 for injunction against respondent No. 2 was initiated invoking the arbitration provision of the said SCA, which came to be dismissed vide order dated 13th September 2007 by the learned Judge of the City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, against which, First Appeal is pending before this Court for hearing.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">4.7 The challenge in this petition qua the impugned communications dated 3rd and 8th November 2007 addressed by respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 2, respectively, on the ground of breach of principles of natural justice, etc., has genesis in the letters dated 10.5.2003 and 2.8.2005 and the show cause notice dated 24.2.2006 issued by the Chief Engineer of respondent No. 1, a copy whereof was also addressed to respondent No. 2, calling upon to show cause why permission/approval granted to the SCA should not be withdrawn as P&amp;O Ports had reportedly been taken over by DPW which amounted to dilution of equity by P&amp;O Ports [Mundra] without prior permission or approval of respondent No. 1, as well as transfer of the undertaking, assets and property without prior consent of respondent No. 1. It was indicated that the first petitioner was in breach of the undertaking furnished on 26.5.2003 and SCA was not finally approved by the GMB.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">4.8 By letters dated 31.3.2006, 27.7.2006, 28.8.2006, 29.5.2007 and 23.7.2007, replies were submitted by the petitioner and personal hearings were granted on 30.5.2006 and 31.7.2006 and even written submissions were filed on 19.6.2006 and 11.8.2006. As per the replies and written submissions, the petitioner pointed out every compliance of all requirements and undertaking given and non-acceptance of additional conditions suggested as amendments to the existing SCA. The petitioner also furnished documentary evidence to establish that there was no change whatsoever in the company and no breach of any of the conditions of the SCA and even after pre and post acquisition of POSNCO by DPW, the shareholding structure remained unchanged. It was pointed out that the first petitioner had not transferred any assets or property or undertaking and, according to the petitioner, final order was awaited.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">4.9 It is the case of the petitioners that, however, respondent No. 2, due to strain relationship between the petitioners and respondent No. 2, willfully and deliberately refrained from supporting the first petitioner in the proceedings before respondent No. 1 and no submissions were filed and, indirectly, supported the said show cause notice.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">4.10 By the first impugned communication dated 3.11.2007, respondent No. 1 directed respondent No. 2 to immediately initiate legal action for termination of SCA and by the second impugned consequential communication dated 8.11.2007 by respondent No. 2 to the petitioner, it is stated by respondent No. 2 that SCA stood terminated. The above action, according to the petitioner, is contrary to the settled position of law, meaning thereby, no opportunity of hearing is given to the petitioners and without following any procedure of law, respondent No. 1 has acted illegally. That, after having issued show cause notice dated 24.2.2006 and in spite of various replies and written submissions filed by the petitioners, without pronouncing any verdict on it, the action of the termination of SCA on the part of the respondents, during the pendency of the above proceedings between the petitioners and respondent No. 1, amounts to colourable exercise of power by respondent No. 1, a statutory body constituted under the Statute of 1981 and duty bound to act in just, fair and reasonable manner. Therefore, the impugned communication dated 3rd November 2007 issued by the first respondent and consequential communication dated 8th November 2007 issued by respondent No. 2 deserve to be quashed and set aside by this Court in exercise of extra-ordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">5. Dr. Abhishek Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, submits that the challenge in this petition is against arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious action of respondent No. 1 in communicating the letter dated 3.11.2007 to respondent No. 2 to terminate the contract in terms of SCA entered into between respondent No. 2 and the petitioner. According to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the above action is not only arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious, but the same suffers from non-application of mind, patently mala fide, collusive, illegal and also violative of principles of natural justice and ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_14\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_15\">19(i)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India and ab-initio null and void without any legal effect whatsoever. The learned Counsel for the petitioners further submits that the question before this Court is not the interpretation of the terms and conditions and various Clauses incorporated in CA or SCA as approved by respondent No. 1, but the basic question is: whether respondent No. 1-Gujarat Maritime Board, a statutory Board constituted under the Act of 1981, can act de hors the requirement of principles of natural justice, fair-play and reasonableness. It is further submitted that the impugned communication dated 3.11.2007 by respondent No. 1 to respondent No. 2, taking recourse to Clauses 7.2[d], 7.2[e] and 8.5 of CA, directing the licensee, respondent No. 2 herein, to invoke Clauses of SCA and to initiate necessary legal action for terminating SCA with the petitioner, is a camouflage and colourable exercise of power in as much as respondent No. 1 had issued show cause notice to the petitioner on 24.2.2006, whereby, the petitioner was called upon to show cause within seven days from the date of receipt of above communication as to why permission/approval granted to SCA vide order dated 10.5.2003 should not be withdrawn on the ground that the petitioner has acted in breach of the undertaking furnished and acted contrary to the approval of FIPB and the conditions laid down thereunder read with letter dated 10.5.2003. Even prior to the above show cause notice dated 24.2.2006, respondent No. 1 addressed letter to the petitioner on 2.8.2005 for pending compliance to be carried out in respect of SCA by the petitioner since the SCA was not finally approved. The above show cause notice indicated that no prior consent of respondent No. 1 was obtained for further transfer of property, assets or undertaking related to the container terminal at Port Mundra to a third party and no prior consent of GMB for dilution of equity shareholding in MICTL in spite of the fact that P &amp; O Ports was to maintain minimum of 51% paid equity shares of MIACTL for a period of seven years from the date of acquiring share of MICTL. Not only that, the above show cause notice reflected that P &amp; O Ports was reportedly taken over by another entity, namely, DPW, which amounts to dilution of equity of P &amp; O Ports without prior permission of the Board. Therefore, when the above issues replied and denied any breach by the petitioner by various communications dated 31.3.2006, 27.7.2006, 28.8.2006, 29.5.2007, 23.7.2007 and written submission filed on 19.6.2006 and 11.8.2006 and personal hearings were given on two different occasions, respondent No. 1, a State Authority within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, was duty bound to hear the petitioner and pass a speaking and reasoned order in accordance with law and not to convey/direct respondent No. 2 ultimately to terminate contract, namely, SCA, without adjudicating the issues involved in the show cause notice.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">5.1 It is next contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that respondent No. 1 is like a quasi-judicial authority and, when the dispute had arisen according to the Board, a procedure was required to be followed and a final decision on such enquiry is the necessity of the rule of law for any statutory authority, which is bypassed in the present case and, therefore, the exercise undertaken by respondent No. 1 in addressing communication dated 3.11.2007 deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">5.2 It is next contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that even in the capacity of administrative authority under the statute, it is expected of the authority to act in just, fair and reasonable manner in exercise of its power even in the realm of contractual relationship, and respondent No. 1, being a public authority amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, every action of such Authority is to be tested on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and by raising a plea of non-maintainability of the petition, which is to be decided by this Court as a preliminary issue, respondent No. 1, GMB, cannot be excluded from its statutory liability as contended above. It is also contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that without following the principles of natural justice as embodied in various decisions of the Apex Court and part and parcel of rule of law and having undertaken exercise of determining the issues between the petitioner and respondent No. 2 and the Board, issuance of direction to respondent No. 2 to terminate the contract and rendering the petitioner remedyless is nothing, but, exercise of power by the Authority in illegal manner and it amounts to malice in law, which deserves to be set right by this Court in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">5.3 Even on merits also, learned Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that there is no violation of any Clauses of CA or SCA in as much as the position of the petitioner-company was explained through various communications to the Board and it was emphasized that there was no change whatsoever in the holding of equity shares held in MICTL by P&amp;O Ports [Mundra] Pvt. Ltd., Mauritius [P&amp;O Mundra]. It was further submitted that there was no alienation of any assets or substantially the whole or any of the undertakings since the time P&amp;O Mundra acquired 100% of equity capital of MICTL. Not only that, but since November 2002 and right until 2004, the entire equity share capital of P&amp;O Mundra was owned and held by P&amp;O Overseas Holdings Limited. On December 8, 2004, the entire shareholding was transferred to P&amp;O Dover (Holdings) Ltd, which in turn till date holds the entire equity share capital of P&amp;O Mundra. Both P&amp;O Overseas Holdings Limited and P&amp;O Dover (Holdings) Ltd are wholly owned subsidiaries of P&amp;OSNCO. Prior to March 2006, P&amp;OSNCO was listed in the London Stock Exchange and, thereafter, DPW made an open offer to the shareholders and the shares were purchased on or around 9.3.2006. The above metamorphosis of the corporate structure of the companies from time to time had no bearing on the terms of SCA or CA and, therefore, according to learned Counsel Dr.Singhvi, the GMB could not have acted in arbitrary, unreasonable and unjust manner in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">5.4 Incidentally, it was submitted that, even the above change had no bearing on the violation of the any conditions of FIPB and even DPW is also a sovereign company owned by the Government of Dubai and opearting container terminals in 22 countries around the world including in India at various ports viz Visakhapatnam, Kochi, Chennai and other places. According to the learned Counsel, a similar issue was also raised by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust [JNPT] with regard to Nhava Sheva International Container Terminal Private Limited and upon clarification, the show cause notice was withdrawn. Therefore, when there was no dilution of equity or alienation or transfer of property as alleged, it was submitted that respondent No. 1 ought not to have issued any direction to respondent No. 2 for taking any legal action against the petitioner by placing reliance on certain terms of CA and SCA. According to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, invoking provision of <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1994, was with regard to a dispute, which had arisen between the petitioner and respondent No. 2 with regard to Clause 17, a non-compete Clause, and interpretation with regard to development of second stage assets, which has nothing to do with the relief prayed for in this petition, which is substantially against arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair and illegal action of respondent No. 1, a statutory authority within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India and not acting as required by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_1\">5.5 The learned Counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the following decisions\n  \n\n[i]  <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_24\">Smt.

Mr. Kamal Trivedi, learned Advocate General appearing for respondent No. 1-GMB, has vehemently opposed intervention of this Court in exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India on the ground that no written contract, whatsoever, much less any statutory contract, exists between the petitioner and respondent No. 1. According to learned Advocate General, the subject matter and the issues raised in this petition are in the realm of interpretation of various Clauses, namely, terms and conditions of the agreement in the nature of either CA or SCA and compliance of conditions of approval letter dated 10.5.2003 in principle between respondent No. 1 [Licensor] and respondent No. 2 [Licensee] and consequential effect on the petitioner [sub-licensee] and any action taken in terms of the agreement do not fall within the purview of exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and, when there is no issue to be adjudicated and no lis between the petitioner and respondent No. 1, and respondent No. 1 being not a quasi-judicial authority, the present petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India invoking extra-ordinary jurisdiction deserves to be rejected in limine as it is not maintainable. Learned Advocate General has further contended that communication dated 3.11.2007 addressed by respondent No. 1 to respondent No. 2 is as per the terms of the CA between the licensor and licensee namely, respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 2, and, according to respondent No. 1, when the action of the petitioner, a sub-licensee, was not in consonance with the requirements of Clauses 7.2.[d][e] and 8.5 of CA, the direction to respondent No. 2 to terminate contract/SCA with the petitioner is just and legal. Learned Advocate General has further contended that the approval accorded by the State and the GMB to SCA was in principle and not final subject to compliance of certain conditions by the petitioners and, therefore, as early as on 10.5.2003, it was made specifically clear that the State Government had approved in principle transaction of transferring 100% equity share of MICTL to P &amp; O Ports and may not give approval to allow GMB to grant permission to GAPL for transfer of quay wall [632 meter length] to ACTL for container terminal under the Clause pertains to assignment, viz, Clause 20(b) of CA. The above permission/approval in principle is granted by the Government subject to execution of certain legally enforceable documents and undertaking to be given, which was, in fact, given by the petitioner. Therefore, according to the learned Advocate General, the above approval was conditional and qualified and also on the line of an approval accorded by FIPB vide letter dated 26.2.2003 and, therefore, once again, letter dated 2.8.2005 was written by the GMB to respondent No. 2 for compliance of necessary lacuna and inconsistency in SCA of incorporating certain Clauses as reflected in paragraph 3 of the above letter. Thus, according to the learned Advocate General, the action of the Board of communicating the letter dated 3.11.2007 to respondent No. 2 in the capacity as a licensor to the licensee seeking compliance of various lacuna and to take action in accordance with the terms of the agreement cannot be said to be in any manner arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, illegal or violative of principles of natural justice.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">6.1 Learned Advocate General has further contended that even bare perusal of various Clauses of the contract, particularly, Clauses 3, 7.2(d)(e), 8.5(e) of CA read with Clause 2 of SCA about grant of sub-concession, the same is to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and approved project report and the agreement of sub-concession by the licensee, shall not be inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the concession agreement and being co-terminus with the same. According to the learned Advocate General, a duty is cast upon the sub-licensee to perform its obligations in the same manner that the licensee is required to perform, subject to Clause 7[d], its obligations under the concessional agreement. The learned Advocate General has placed heavy reliance on the phrase &#x27;subject to xx xx&#x27; &#x27; as appearing in Clauses F, H and 2, 1 of the amended agreement dated 17.4.2003, which binds the petitioner to act in terms of the above Clause.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">6.2 Learned Advocate General has further contended that the contention of the petitioners about violation of principles of natural justice is misconceived in as much as respondent No1-Board had taken up a fact-finding enquiry of preliminary nature so as to satisfy itself as to whether the petitioners have acted in terms of the undertaking given to the Board and such action is as per the terms of CA and SCA as approved in principle. The above exercise, according to the learned Advocate General, indicates fair and reasonable approach of GMB in furtherance of compliance required under CA and SCA.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">6.3 Learned Advocate General has further contended that the application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1994 is rejected and, therefore, this is an attempt by the petitioners to seek a relief which is otherwise denied by the competent Court by interpreting various Clauses of the contract, against which, First Appeal is pending before this Court for hearing and decision. Not only that, but, according to the learned Advocate General, as provided under SCA and more particularly Clause 19, an in-built mechanism is provided for dispute resolution and, therefore, having partly invoked such mechanism and failed before one Forum, now, the petitioners cannot be permitted to have recourse to writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Even otherwise also, a number of disputed question of facts arises, which needs the evidence to be led, scrutinized and appreciated by the competent Court and remedy of claiming damages is also available to the petitioners. Therefore, this Court will refrain from granting any relief to the petitioner, as prayed for. As per over all submissions of the learned Advocate General, considering the facts and circumstances of the case as submitted above, this is not a fit case, where, this Court would like to exercise power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">7. Shri Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel appearing for respondent No. 2, has defended the consequential letter dated 8.11.2007 by which, follow up action is taken by respondent No. 2 as per the directions given by respondent No. 1 for terminating the contract/SCA as directed, as per Clauses of CA between licensor and licensee. At the outset, according to Shri Dushyant Dave, learned Senior Counsel, this Court is to address itself to two questions, namely, [i] could this writ petition be maintainable and [ii] could it be entertained, and the answer, according to the learned Counsel, is in the negative. In support of the above, learned Senior Counsel, has drawn attention of this Court to the nature of pleadings, as appearing in the body of the petition and particularly paragraphs 5, 6, 10 and 11 of the petition and also grounds contained in paragraph 20, which recite about CA and SCA and violation of various Clauses contained therein and interpretation thereto. The above pleadings, according to learned Senior Counsel, should be the basis of a plaint and not of writ petition and even the relief claimed in paragraph 30 in the backdrop of the above pleadings cannot be considered by this Court in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It is reiterated that no statutory right much less any fundamental or constitutional right is infringed and the dispute raised by the petitioners revolves round CA and SCA in terms of license and sub-license and, having consciously chosen a mechanism for dispute resolution under Clause 19 of SCA by the parties, invocation of writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is not permissible.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">7.1 Shri Dushyant Dave has further submitted that approval accorded by the Government of Gujarat and the Gujarat Maritime Board was only in principle subject to various conditions and Clauses [g] and [i] of above approval dated 10.5.2003, as incorporated, clearly prohibit any transfer of property or assets and, therefore, any action taken, as required under the terms of the contract, need not be disturbed by this Court by granting any relief to the petitioners, as prayed for. According to the learned Senior Counsel, except vague averments about mala fide action and malice in law, no material in support of such pleadings or submissions is produced and it is an attempt in desperation by the petitioners having failed to get any relief under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996, for which, this Court will not hold a roving enquiry of fishing in nature. According to learned Senior Counsel, there is clear breach of Clauses 7.2 and 8.5 of the agreement and SCA is also subject to terms and conditions of CA and approval of licensor, GMB herein, any dispute is to be resolved by resorting to a mechanism of dispute resolution, as chosen by the parties. Thus, according to the learned Senior Counsel, in the realm of contract, the writ court cannot lend its hand to enable a party to exit from the contractual obligations.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_4\">7.2 The learned Senior Counsel appearing for respondent No. 2 has relied upon the following decisions\n  \n\n[i]  <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_40\">State of U.P. and Ors. v.

In rejoinder, Dr. Abhishek Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners has reiterated his submissions about maintainability of the petition for the relief claimed in this petition. He highlighted certain paragraphs in the decision of <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_46\">Smt. Maneka Gandhi</a> [supra] and submitted that the statutory authority is duty bound to follow principles of natural justice and, according to the learned Senior Counsel, Clauses 7, 7.2(d) and (e) and 8.5 are not applicable to the petitioners and no compliance was necessary as stated by the GMB, as replied by the petitioners on various occasions. He further submits that when the show cause notice is issued by the GMB, it cannot be said that it was only a fact-finding-enquiry or preliminary enquiry, but, the same was in the nature of exercise of power by a quasi-judicial authority, for which the Authority is to act in just and fair manner and, therefore, this petition is required to be allowed with costs.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">9. Having heard the learned Counsel for the parties, upon perusal of voluminous record of the case containing various documents including CA and SCA, correspondence entered into between the parties and after considering rival submissions, the judicial review to be undertaken by the Court in exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is always in the backdrop of the factual context of each matter. The ambit and scope of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is to be examined by this Court in view of factual and legal backdrop of this case and a prayer is to the extent of quashing and setting aside communications in the form of impugned letters dated 3.11.2007 [Annexure &quot;O&quot;] and consequential letter dated 8.11.2007 [Annexure &quot;H&quot;] being unjust, unreasonable, arbitrary, a piece of colourable exercise of power, suffers from the vice of non-application of mind, patently mala fide and illegal and ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_49\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_50\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India in juxtaposition to the preliminary objection raised by the respondents about maintainability of the petition.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">9.1 No doubt, <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 226</a> may be a store house or embodiment of justice, equity and good conscience, but at the same time certain limitations are imposed on exercise of such power and that has to be seen in the backdrop of public law remedy, contractual rights and liabilities, tortuous liability, public policies, disputed question of facts, availability of alternative remedy, etc.\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"321019\" id=\"span_9\">10.

In paragraphs 11 and 12 the Apex Court held as under:\n</p>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">11. In the cases before us the contracts do not contain any statutory terms or obligations and no statutory power or obligation which could attract the application of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution is involved here. Even in cases where the question is of choice or consideration of competing claims before an entry into the field of contract facts have to be investigated and found before the question of a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 14</a> could arise. If those facts are disputed and require assessment of evidence the correctness of which can only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidence, involving examination and cross-examination of witnesses, the case could not be conveniently or satisfactorily decided in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Such proceedings are summary proceedings reserved for extraordinary cases where the exceptional and what are described as, perhaps not quite accurately, &#x27;prerogative&#x27; powers of the Court are invoked. We are certain that the cases before us are not such in which powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution could be invoked.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">12. The Patna High Court had, very rightly, divided the types of cases in which breaches of alleged obligation by the State or its agents can be set up into three types. These were stated as follows:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">[i] Where a petitioner makes a grievance of breach of promise on the part of the State in cases where on assurance or promise made by the State he has acted to his prejudice and predicament, but the agreement is short of a contract within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/875627/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 229</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">[ii] Where the contract entered into between the person aggrieved and the State is in exercise of a statutory power under certain Act or Rules framed thereunder and the petitioner alleges a breach on the part of the State; and\n \n\n[iii] Where the contract entered into between the State and the person aggrieved is non-statutory and purely contractual and the rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the terms of the contract, and the petitioner complains about breach of such contract by the State.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">In paragraph 23, with regard to contention of following principles of natural justice and exercise of power by the authorities, the Apex Court observed as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"639803\" id=\"span_19\">23. A rather desparate argument which has been addressed to us on behalf of the appellants is that they were entitled to an opportunity to show cause against the cancellation of lease. It was urged, on the strength of <a href=\"/doc/639803/\" id=\"a_71\">A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India</a>  that the distinction made between administrative and quasi-judicial action is thin and a vanishing one. This argument appears to us to be wholly irrelevant inasmuch as a question of the distinction between an administrative and quasi-judicial decision can only arise in the exercise of powers under statutory provisions. Rules of natural justice are attached to the performance of certain functions regulated by statutes or rules made thereunder involving decisions affecting rights of parties. When a contract is sought to be terminated by the officers of the State, purporting to act under the terms of an agreement between parties, such action is not taken in purported exercise of a statutory power at all.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1893286\" id=\"span_20\">10.3 In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1893286/\" id=\"a_72\">Bareilly Development Authority and Anr. v.

In view of the authoritative judicial pronouncements of this Court in the series of cases dealing with the scope of interference of a High Court while exercising its writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India in cases of non-statutory concluded contracts like the one in hand, we are constrained to hold that the High Court in the present case has gone wrong in its finding that there is arbitrariness and unreasonableness on the part of the appellants herein in increasing the cost of the houses/flats and the rate of monthly instalments and giving directions in the writ petitions as prayed for.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_23\">10.4 In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_77\">State of U.P. v. Bridge &amp; Roof Co. [India] Limited</a> , the Apex Court was on the issue of maintainability in view of alternative remedy, etc. whether dispute was relating to terms of private contract and it involved interpretation of the terms of the contract and also of the order issued under the statutory provisions of Section 7D and proviso to Section 8D(i) of the U.P. Trade Tax Act, 1948. The Apex Court held that the order of the High Court was just and proper in not going into the dispute since it involved interpretation of the terms of contract. In paragraphs 16 and 17, the Apex Court held as under:</span>\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">16. Firstly, the contract between the parties is a contract in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory contract. It is governed by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_78\">Contract Act</a> or, may be, also by certain provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_79\">Sale of Goods Act</a>. Any dispute relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of such a contract cannot be agitated, and could not have been agitated, in a writ petition. That is a matter either for arbitration as provided by the contract or for the civil court, as the case may be. Whether any amount is due to the respondent from the appellant-Government under the contract and, if so, how much and the further question whether retention or refusal to pay any amount by the Government is justified, or not are all matters which cannot be agitated in or adjudicated upon in a writ petition. The prayer in the writ petition, via., to restrain the Government from deducting a particular amount from the writ petitioner&#x27;s bill(s) was not a prayer which could be granted by the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 226.</a> Indeed, the High Court has not granted the said prayer.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">17. Secondly, whether there has been a reduction in the statutory liability on account of a change in law within the meaning of Sub-clause (4) of Clause 70 of the contract is again not a matter to be agitated in the writ petition. That is again a matter relating to interpretation of a term of the contract and should be agitated before the arbitrator or the civil court, as the case may be. If any amount is wrongly withheld by the Government, the remedy of the respondent is to raise a dispute as provided by the contract or to approach the civil court, as the case may be, according to law. Similarly if the Government says that any overpayment has been made to the respondent, its remedy also is the same.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">Later on, for not entertaining the claim of the appellant, the Apex Court relied upon a Clause providing, inter alia, for settlement of disputes by reference to arbitration and held that when contract itself provides for a mode of settlement of disputes arising from the contract, there was no reason why the party should not follow and adopt that remedy and invoke extraordinary jurisdiction of the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">10.5 In the case of World Tel  also the Apex Court set aside the order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in a matter arising from contractual obligations and held that the High Court ought not to go into merits of the contentious issues under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Instead, the parties should have been directed to a civil court so that the hotly disputed issues could have been resolved in a civil litigation.

Worker&#x27;s Union (2001) 1 SCC 298, the Apex Court in paragraphs 27 and 28 held as under:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">27. From the above discussion of ours, the following legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">[a] In an appropriate case, a writ petition against a State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of a contractual obligation is maintainable.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">[b] Merely because some disputed questions of fact arise for consideration, same cannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as a matter of rule.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">[c] A writ petition involving a consequential relief of monetary claim is also maintainable.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"172383107\" id=\"span_30\">28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact that the power to issue prerogative writs under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power See <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_93\">Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks  And</a> this plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 14</a> or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for which the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the said jurisdiction.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_31\">Thereafter, in paragraph 52, the Apex Court quoted the law <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_95\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_96\">Shrilekha Vidyarthi</a> [supra] that;</span>\n</p>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">The requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 14</a> should extend even in the sphere of contractual matters for regulating the conduct of the State activity. Applicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 14</a> to all executive actions of the State being settled and for the same reason its applicability at the threshold to the making of a contract in exercise of the executive power being beyond dispute, the State cannot thereafter cast off its personality and exercise unbridled power unfettered by the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 14</a> in the sphere of contractual matters and claim to be governed therein only by private law principles applicable to private individuals whose rights flow only from the terms of the contract without anything more. The personality of the State, requiring regulation of its conduct in all spheres by requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 14</a>, does not undergo such a radical change after the making of a contract merely because some contractual rights accrue to the other party in addition. It is not as if the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 14</a> and contractual obligations are alien concepts, which cannot coexist. The Constitution does not envisage or permit unfairness or unreasonableness in State actions in any sphere of its activity contrary to the professed ideals in the preamble. Therefore, total exclusion of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 14 -</a> non-arbitrariness which is basic to rule of law - from State action in contractual field is not justified. This is more so when the modern trend is also to examine the unreasonableness of a term in such contracts where the bargaining power is unequal so that these are not negotiated contracts but standard form contracts between unequals.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">Unlike the private parties the State while exercising its powers and discharging its functions, acts indubitably, as is expected of it, for public good and in public interest. The impact of every State action is also on public interest. It is really the nature of its personality as State which is significant and must characterize all its actions, in whatever field, and not the nature of function, contractual or otherwise, which is decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted for examining the validity of its act. The requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 14</a> being the duty to act fairly, justly, and reasonably, there is nothing which militates against the concept of requiring the State always to so act, even in contractual matters. This factor alone is sufficient to import at least the minimal requirements of public law obligations and impress with this character the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It is a different matter that the scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is made on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 14</a> by alleging that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of contractual obligations would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the basic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 14.</a> To this extent, the obligation is of a public character invariably in every case irrespective of there being any other right or obligation in addition thereto. An additional contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 14</a> of non-arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of its action\n \n\nand held in paragraph 53 that when an instrumentality of the State acts contrary to public good and public interest, unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably, in its contractual, constitutional or statutory obligations, it really acts contrary to the constitutional guarantee found in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and, therefore, in the factual situation of that case, the relief was granted as prayed for. Thus, having held in paragraphs 27 and 28 as above, the Apex Court found that this limited area of dispute can be settled by looking into the terms of the contract of insurance as well as the export contract, and the same does not require consideration of any oral evidence or any other documentary evidence other than what is already on record without any external aid. Accordingly, the relief was granted and the appeal was allowed to that extent.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"231341\" id=\"span_32\">10.8 In the case of <a href=\"/doc/231341/\" id=\"a_108\">National Textile Corporation Limited and Ors. v. Haribox Swalram and Ors.</a> , the Apex Court, in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17, found that the writ petition involved disputed questions of fact and can be proved by leading evidence in a properly constituted suit which was not required to be investigated in writ petition. The Apex <a href=\"/doc/231341/\" id=\"a_109\">Court further held</a> that in order to issue a writ of mandamus or to compel authorities to do something, it must be shown that there is a statute which imposes a legal duty and the aggrieved party has a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance. The Apex Court refused to issue writ of mandamus on the ground that the case on hand was of pure and simple business contract.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"321019\" id=\"span_33\">10.9 What should be the approach of the Court in a case where an action of the State or its instrumentality is challenged on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_110\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_111\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India, particularly when such impugned action has genesis in an agreement/contract entered into, is aptly summarized by the Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/321019/\" id=\"a_112\">State of U.P. v. Johri Mal</a> . After taking into consideration various case-laws, the Apex Court, speaking through Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice S.B. Sinha, described the scope of judicial review in paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 as under:</span>\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191872\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1598981\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"730804\" id=\"span_36\">22. The power of judicial review is now well-defined in a series of decisions of this Court. It is trite that the Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain a writ application in a matter governed by contract qua contract [assuming such professional engagement to be one], as therein public law element would not be involved.

The legal right of an individual may be founded upon a contract or a statute or an instrument having the force of law. For a public law remedy enforceable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, the actions of the authority need to fall in the realm of public law be it a legislative act of the State, an executive act of the State or an instrumentality or a person or authority imbued with public law element. The question is required to be determined in each case having regard to the nature of and extent of authority vested in the State. However, it may not be possible to generalize the nature of the action which would come either under public law remedy or private law field nor is it desirable to give exhaustive list of such actions.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">In paragraph 28, scope and extent of power of the judicial review of the High Court contained in <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is summarized as under:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">28. The scope and extent of power of the judicial review of the High Court contained in <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India would vary from case to case, the nature of the order, the relevant statute as also the other relevant factors including the nature of power exercised by the public authorities, namely, whether the power is statutory, quasi judicial or administrative. The power of judicial review is not intended to assume a supervisory role or done the robes of omnipresent. The power is not intended either to review governance under the rule of law nor do the Courts step into the areas exclusively reserved by the supreme lex to the other organs of the State. Decisions and actions which do not have adjudicative disposition may not strictly fall for consideration before a judicial review Court. The limited scope of judicial review succinctly put are:\n</blockquote>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">[i] Courts, while exercising the power of judicial review, do not sit in appeal over the decisions of administrative bodies.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">[ii] A petition for a judicial review would lie only on certain well-defined grounds.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">[iii] An order passed by an administrative authority exercising discretion vested in it, cannot be interfered in judicial review unless it is shown that exercise of discretion itself is perverse or illegal.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">[iv] A mere wrong decision without any thing more is not enough to attract the power of judicial review; the supervisory jurisdiction conferred on a Court is limited to seeing that Tribunal functions within the limits of its authority and that is decisions do not occasion miscarriage of justice.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">[v] The Courts cannot be called upon to undertake the Government duties and functions. The Court shall not ordinarily interfere with a policy decision of the State. Social and economic belief of a Judge should not be invoked as a substitute for the judgment of the legislative bodies See Ira Munn v. State of Ellinois 1876 (94) US [Supreme Reports] 113\n \n\nIn paragraph 29, His Lordship has referred to pages 33-35 of Wade&#x27;s Administrative Law, 8th Edition and, in paragraph 30, observed as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\"> 30. It is well-settled that while exercising the power of judicial review the Court is more concerned with the decision making process than the merit of the decision itself. In doing so, it is often argued by the defender of an impugned decision that the Court is not competent to exercise its power when there are serious disputed questions of facts; when the decision of the Tribunal or the decision of the fact finding body or the arbitrator is given finality by the statute which governs a given situation or which, by nature of the activity the decision maker&#x27;s opinion on facts is final. But while examining and scrutinizing the decision making process it becomes inevitable to also appreciate the facts of a given case as otherwise the decision cannot be tested under the grounds of illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety. How far the Court of judicial review can reappreciate the findings of facts depends on the ground of judicial review. For example, if a decision is challenged as irrational, it would be well-nigh impossible to record a finding whether a decision is rational or irrational without first evaluating the facts of the case and coming to a plausible conclusion and then testing the decision of the authority on the touch-stone of the tests laid down by the Court with special reference to a given case. This position is well settled in Indian Administrative Law. Therefore, to a limited extent of scrutinizing the decision making process, it is always open to the Court to review the evaluation of facts by the decision maker.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">After referring to various authoritative writings of Prop. Bernad Schwartz, Prof. Clive Lewis, Grahme Aldous and John Alder with regard to judicial review in American context, judicial remedies in public law, and perception about applications for judicial review, law and practice and again referring to pages 551-552 in Wade&#x27;s Administrative Law, 8th Edition, Their Lordships concluded that a writ of or in the nature of mandamus, it is trite, is ordinarily issued where the petitioner establishes a legal right in himself and a corresponding legal duty in the public authorities. In paragraph 61 with reference to Shrilekha Vidyarthi and a paragraph quoted therein, it is observed that, &#x27;we have our own reservations about the aforementioned principles of law, but for the purpose of this case, it is not necessary to advert thereto¬ and the case on hand was decided on its own merit.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">11.

The above port policy envisaged development of ten green-field ports, six of them as fully private and four as joint sector ports. The Gujarat Maritime Board is to act as Co-ordinating Agency in the implementation of the above policy. By resolution dated 29.7.1997, the Government announced package of BOOT Principles as a next action of the Government, which will serve as a framework for involvement of private sector in the construction and operation of these new ports. Accordingly, certain guiding principles were also framed for BOOT Principles.

Therefore, in view of the above legal and factual aspects, if rival submissions of the parties are considered keeping in mind the determination of the State Government to develop minor ports in the State of Gujarat, BOOT policy, coordinating role of the Gujarat Maritime Board and the grant of licence by GMB to respondent No. 2 by CA as licensee and in turn by SCA grant of sub-licence by respondent No. 2 to the petitioner, as sub-licensee, role of the GMB surfaces when the GMB accorded its consent in terms of Clause 8.5(b) of the CA for grant of sub-concession by licensee respondent No. 2 in favour of sub-licensee, the petitioner, in relation to assets of container terminal. That respondent No. 2 decided to dispose of container terminal business at Mundra Port to P&amp;O Ports Mundra Limited and thereafter a framework agreement was executed, which also included Clause 5.2 for second stage assets and non-compete Clauses 7 and 7.1. The above frame work agreement and interpretation of Clauses 11.1.2 and 17 of SCA about rights of the parties were subject matter of the proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and, against the decision of the Civil Court rejecting the said application, First Appeal is pending before this Court and the matter being sub-judice and not much relevant at this stage for deciding the issue in question, I do not refer and discuss herein.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">13. Later on, a transaction of transferring 100 equity shares of ACTL to P&amp;O Ports was approved in principle by the letter of GMB to the Managing Director of GAPL on certain terms and conditions which were already reproduced in the foregoing paragraphs for which correspondence took place between the petitioner and the GMB, arising out of agreements in the form of SCA or CA entered into between the parties. If both CA and SCA are perused, respondent No. 1-GMB has not entered into any contract or any agreement with the petitioner. That, all rights and liabilities accrue to any of the parties emanate from various Clauses of terms and conditions as indicated in CA and/or SCA. That, specific Clause of CA, as reproduced in the earlier paragraphs, namely, Clause 3 is about licensing framework which includes grant of concession and particularly Clause 8.5 refers to sub-concession for construction of assets which mandates the licensee to fulfill all obligations to construct and operate in contracted assets by granting sub-concession to third parties and the licensee is also to obtain prior written consent of the licensor for granting sub-concession in respect of core assets and all sub-concessions granted by the licensee to third parties and long term commercial agreements entered into by the licensee with third parties have to be consistent with the terms and conditions of the agreement and co-terminus also. Clause 8.5[e][iii] mandates the licensee to ensure that the sub-concessionaire performs its obligations in the same manner that the licensee is required to perform its obligations under the CA.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">14. At the same time, SCA dated 7.1.2003 provides Clause 2 as licensing framework and Clause 2.1 is grant of sub-concession. The SCA entered into between respondent No. 2 and the petitioner clearly mentions that all rights and obligations of the parties under this agreement shall be subject to and exercised and discharged in compliance with the Concession Agreement. Clause 17, non-compete Clause, and Clause 19 of SCA provide for dispute resolution between licensee and sub-licensee. Therefore, a bare perusal of the above agreements namely CA and SCA, reveals that any breach of Clauses of SCA will have to be resolved as envisaged in Clause 19 of the SCA.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">14.1 Thus, relationship between the petitioner and the Gujarat Maritime Board, respondent No. 1, is nowhere governed by any agreement much less a statutory agreement. CA is between respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 1 and SCA between respondent No. 2 and the petitioner. No direct agreement exists between the GMB and the petitioner. If the GMB takes a decision directing respondent No. 2 to take an action against the petitioner in consonance with the CA for breach of any of the Clauses of SCA and CA as stated in the impugned communications, it cannot be said to be a decision or State action, which is required to be tested on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_139\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_140\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The whole exercise undertaken by the GMB by way of addressing letters to the petitioner was in the realm of ascertaining the nature of change in corporate structure, if any, and to satisfy itself, prima-facie, whether there was any breach of Clauses of CA or SCA or letter dated 10.5.2003 approved in principle by the State. In view of this, the learned Advocate General is right in his submission that the above exercise of GMB was a preliminary enquiry for finding out certain facts, for which, no lis did exist and there was no question of adjudicating any issues in the capacity as a quasi-judicial authority.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">15. What is impugned in this petition, if carefully perused, along with nature of pleadings as contained in paragraphs 15, 16, 17 and grounds contained in paragraph 20 of the petition referring to termination of SCA and alleged breach of various Clauses, apparently is communication dated 3.11.2007 addressed by respondent No. 1 to respondent No. 2 and communication dated 8.11.2007 addressed by respondent No. 2 to the petitioner, inter alia, alleging breach of Clauses 7.2[d] and 7.2[e] and Clause 8.5 of CA, which refer to approval in principle by the GMB of CA which was executed on 17.2.2001 between respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 1 and also of SCA dated 7.1.2003 signed and revised on 17.4.2003 between respondent No. 2 and the petitioner. It further refers to seeking various clarifications since respondent No. 1, vide letter dated 10.5.2003, based upon the approval given by the FIPB dated 26.2.2003 and the State Government, approved in principle the transaction of transfer of 100% equity shares of ACTL to P&amp;O Ports and the transfer of core assets by GAPL to ACTL for container terminal, now respondent No. 2 to the petitioner. It also refers to letter dated 2.8.2005 addressed by GMB to respondent No. 2 to remove the inconsistencies in SCA which have been not complied with. Clauses 7.2[d] and 7.2[e] of CA are already reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment and the same are referred to in the impugned communication dated 3.11.2007 and, according to respondent No. 1, there appeared to be breach of above Clauses of CA. Though denied, the above disputed facts and applicability of Clauses of CA and SCA and interpretation of such Clauses need detailed examination of oral and documentary evidence and, therefore also, the present petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is not maintainable. Any letter addressed to respondent No. 2 for taking action emanates from the contractual terms and conditions and it is exclusively a matter between respondent No. 2 and respondent No. 1 and any consequential effect upon the petitioner as per the impugned communication dated 8.11.2007 addressed by respondent No. 2 against the petitioner of terminating SCA is exclusively in the realm of contract, for which, power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India cannot be exercised on the basis that respondent No. 1 is a statutory body/instrumentality of the State and amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court for its action of directing respondent No. 2 to terminate the agreement and the remedy, whatsoever, for the second impugned communication by respondent No. 2 to the petitioner for terminating the SCA, is exclusively out of purview of exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and, as stated earlier, respondent No. 1-GMB had no, statutory or otherwise, direct agreement with the petitioner.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">16. Therefore, it is not possible to accept the submissions of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners that this petition directed against arbitrary, unreasonable, unjust, unfair and colourable exercise of power of the GMB in directing respondent No. 2 to terminate licence is maintainable since there is negation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India requires to be exercised. Thus, remedy for redressal of the grievances of the petitioner does not lie before this Court by invoking <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, but elsewhere. This Court, while exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India cannot adjudicate upon a dispute arising out of breach/violation of Clauses of agreement and pass a verdict on legality or otherwise of such alleged breaches of contractual terms.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">17. The contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner about breach of principles of natural justice is also not of much substance, in as much as, even if the communication addressed by the GMB to the petitioner is perused, it reflects just and fair approach on the part of the Board in seeking explanation and clarification with regard to prior approval of the Government in principle which was not final and for which the petitioner was not only heard but also permitted to submit its version in writing and, therefore, the action of the Board from the above angle also is non-arbitrary and reasonable. If any adverse effect upon the petitioner of the direction given by the GMB in the capacity as a licensor to respondent No. 2 a licensee to terminate the contract/licence in terms of CA and SCA and if respondent No. 2 has taken such consequential action, recourse can be taken as per inbuilt Clauses of SCA, for which power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India cannot be invoked.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_41\">18. As clearly borne out from the record, even the principles of natural justice are also not violated since GMB even for finding out certain facts, had given ample opportunity by permitting the petitioner to file written statement and even personal hearing was given and, therefore, the reliance placed by the learned Counsel for the petitioner in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_150\">Smt.

So far as other contentions about arbitrary exercise of power by respondent No. 1 and failure to defend the cause of the petitioner by respondent No. 2 before respondent No. 1-GMB, are concerned, it will again be a case which is required to be looked into by the appropriate forum and not in exercise of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. So far as respondent No. 1 is concerned, it has acted within the framework of CA in the capacity of a licensor when it was not satisfied with the explanation rendered by the petitioner about various clarification as sought for, which emanated from the letters dated 10.5.2003, 2.8.2005 and notices issued thereafter and it was open for the GMB to direct its lisencee to take action immediately in terms of SCA and, for any grievance arises therefrom, the petitioner is to seek remedy elsewhere.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">20. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_42\">In <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_152\">Shrilekha Vidyarthi</a>  (supra), the Apex Court was concerned with en-mass termination of appointments of District Government Counsel in all Districts of U.P. and presence of public element attached to the office or post of District Government Counsel was considered sufficient to attract <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. Thus, there was a challenge to the State action, which was unjust, unreasonable, arbitrary and in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_43\">So far as the present case is concerned, the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_155\">Shrilekha Vidyarthi</a> {supra} is of no help to the petitioner in as much as the action of GMB is taken in terms of the licence and simply arises out of a contract between respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 2 and any consequential order passed by respondent No. 2 against the petitioners is also within four corners of SCA.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">21. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_45\">In <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_156\">ABL International Limited</a>  {supra}, insurance contract of covering risk arising out of payment of consideration by a particular mode was covered and alternative mode of payment inserted by addendum on the very same day as original agreement required interpretation in the context of the fact that whether risk of payment by alternative mode was also covered under the clause of contract and, thus, after considering various aspects, as reproduced in earlier paragraphs of this judgment, namely, paragraphs 27, 28 and 52, wherein <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_157\">Shrilekha Vidyarthi</a> (supra) is also discussed, the Apex Court found that the policy of insurance covering risk of appellants was issued by the first respondent after seeking all required information and receiving the huge sums of money as premium and, on facts, it was found that terms of policy do not give any room for ambiguity as to risk covered by the first respondent. In the present case, no contractual liability arises so far as GMB is concerned and, as held in paragraph 28, &#x27;plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India&#x27;.</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_46\">22. Even in <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_159\">Radhakrishna Agarwal</a>  (supra), argument about an opportunity to show cause against cancellation of lease was found to be wholly irrelevant in as much as a question and distinction between an administrative and quasi-judicial decision only arises in exercise of power under the statutory provision and rules of natural justice are attached to the performance of certain functions regulated by Statute or Rules made thereunder involving decision affected rights of parties and when contract is sought to be terminated by the officers of the State purporting to act under the terms of agreement between the parties, such action is not taken in purported exercise of a statutory power at all. In the facts of the present case, GMB has taken action only under the terms of licence directing its licensee to act in accordance with the terms of licence and any action taken by the licensee against the sub-licensee, the petitioner herein, that too in terms of sub-licence, cannot be said to be an action of the State or its instrumentality to be decided on the touch-stone of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"629330\" id=\"span_47\">23.

S.R. Venkataraman v. Union of India and Anr.</a> is also misplaced, since no material in support of the above contention is produced on record except vague averments of mala fide and this Court cannot hold a roving enquiry into such allegations.

So far as the development of second stage assets comprising of 618 meters quay wall and 19.633 hectares of back up area for container storage is concerned, the dispute, which has arisen between respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 2, is now pending before this Court by way of First Appeal, since the application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act filed by the petitioner is rejected by the City Civil Court.\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"629330\" id=\"span_48\">25. It is to be noted that, when there is paradigm shift in the economic policy of the government and liberalization, privatization and globalisation are basic concepts of such shift, along with advantages of LPG, certain abrasions or scars do take place and the private sector has to gear itself and prepare to face such consequences as a part of their business affairs. Any grievance, which may arise, in the backdrop of the above economic policy, unless it is clearly brought within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_163\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_164\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_165\">21</a> of the Constitution of India or patent breach of any fundamental right of a person, invocation of writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is unwarranted and the ambit and scope of the Court to exercise such power is circumscribed as discussed in the earlier paragraphs and the law <a href=\"/doc/629330/\" id=\"a_167\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191872\" id=\"span_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_51\">26.

It is pertinent to note that, in paragraph 30 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/321019/\" id=\"a_172\">Johri Mal</a> (supra), it is observed by the Apex Court that while examining and scrutinizing the decision making process it becomes inevitable to also appreciate the facts of a given case as otherwise the decision cannot be tested on the grounds of illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety. How far the Court of judicial review can reappreciate the findings of facts depends on the ground of judicial review. Therefore, it is always open to the Court to a limited extent of scrutinizing the decision making process to review the evaluation of facts by the decision maker. In view of the above, this Court has not indulged to examine the legality or validity of the action of the respondents otherwise than the grounds of challenge in this petition for a limited purpose.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">28.
