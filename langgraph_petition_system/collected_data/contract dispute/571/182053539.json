The Society owned the certain land, which was divided into several plots and were allotted to the Members of the society including one land to the petitioner.  Lucknow Development Authority ( hereinafter called as L.D.A.) sought to acquire the land and to transfer the same to a builder to be sold to the general public for residential purposes.  Aggrieved by the action of L.D.A. the society filed a writ petition no.-881/1986   M/s Geet Vihar Sahkari Awas Samiti Versus State of U.P. and L.D.A., and subsequently a contempt notice was also issued against the L.D.A.  Later on a proposal for effecting a compromise was mooted by the L.D.A. and the matter was settled by registered agreement with certain conditions as laid down in the agreement deed. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3-\t\t It has been submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the amount of the plot has been paid to the society and afterward an amount of rupees 21,250/- was paid to the L.D.A. towards development charges.  After lapse of several years the petitioner was not allotted any land in terms of the compromise between the society and the L.D.A. and later on request was made to the L.D.A. to develop the land even to demark the plot but the same was not acted upon and after that the petitioner submitted an application before L.D.A. for transfer of her allotment of plot from Sitapur road to any other scheme and again on 9.2.1999 a request was made for consideration of allotment of plot from Sitapur road scheme to Gomti Nagar Scheme and on 14.3.2000 she was communicated to consult the competent authority in the L.D.A. for taking final decision in the matter.  The petitioner further made a representation before the Secretary, Awas U.P. Government, Lucknow, who forwarded her representation to the L.D.A. asking for immediate comments and in compliance thereof L.D.A. informed the petitioner vide letter dated 12.9.2007 regarding allotment of plot no.-3/154 Viraj Khand, Gomti Nagar Scheme.  The L.D.A. demanded an amount of rupees 11,42,117/- and it is alleged by the petitioner that it was contrary to the compromise deed and cannot be demanded by the L.D.A.  When the amount mentioned in the notice was not paid by the petitioner , the L.D.A. vide letter and order dated 26.5.2009 informed the petitioner regarding cancellation of the allotment of the above plot and later on the petitioner make a request to recall the order and after repeated request and representation, the L.D.A. has not taken any action, thus the present writ petition has been preferred by the petitioner.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4-\t\tBy filing counter affidavit the L.D.A. has submitted that the land was acquired under the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_3\">Land Acquisition Act</a> and possession was taken by the State Government and handed over to the L.D.A.

In any event, one thing is clear and beyond doubt that no such period of limitation can be laid down either under the rules made by the High Court or by practice. For every case, it would have to be decided on the facts and circumstances whether the petitioner is guilty of laches and that would have to be done without taking into account any specific period as period of limitation.

The High Court has, no doubt, discretionary power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to quash the notification under <a href=\"/doc/343062/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 4 (1)</a> and Declaration under <a href=\"/doc/1215324/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 6</a>.

This aspect, being dependant upon the examination of the facts of the case and such a contention not having been raised before the High Court, it would not be appropriate to allow the appellants to raise such a contention for the first time before us. Besides, where the mode is that the period for which the option of renewal has been exercised, has not come to an end. During the subsistence of such a period, certainly the respondents could make a complaint that such exercise of option was not available to the appellants and, therefore, the jurisdiction of the High Court could be invoked even at a later stage.

Kurien E. Kalathil and Ors. MANU/SC/0435/2000MANU/SC/0435/2000</a> : AIR 2000 SC 2573, this Court held that a writ cannot lie to resolve a disputed question of fact, particularly to interpret the disputed terms of a contract observing as under:</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">   &quot;........... The interpretation and implementation of a clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ petition. ....If a term of a contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 226.</a> We are also unable to agree with the observations of the High Court that the contractor was seeking enforcement of a statutory contract.....\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">&quot;...........The contract between the parties is in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory contract. The disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract.... The contractor should have relegated to other remedies.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">74-\t\t It is evident from the above, that generally the court should not exercise its writ jurisdiction to enforce the contractual obligation. The primary purpose of a writ of mandamus, is to protect and establish rights and to impose a corresponding imperative duty existing in law. It is designed to promote justice (ex debito justiceiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is at the discretion of the court. The writ cannot be granted unless it is established that there is an existing legal right of the applicant, or an existing duty of the Respondent. Thus, the writ does not lie to create or to establish a legal right, but to enforce one that is already established. While dealing with a writ petition, the court must exercise discretion, taking into consideration a wide variety of circumstances, inter-alia, the facts of the case, the exigency that warrants such exercise of discretion, the consequences of grant or refusal of the writ, and the nature and extent of injury that is likely to ensue by such grant or refusal.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">75-\t\t Hence, discretion must be exercised by the court on grounds of public policy, public interest and public good. The writ is equitable in nature and thus, its issuance is governed by equitable principles. Refusal of relief must be for reasons which would lead to injustice. The prime consideration for the issuance of the said writ is, whether or not substantial justice will be promoted. Furthermore, while granting such a writ, the court must make every effort to ensure from the averments of the writ petition, whether there exist proper pleadings. In order to maintain the writ of mandamus, the first and foremost requirement is that the petition must not be frivolous, and must be filed in good faith. Additionally, the applicant must make a demand which is clear, plain and unambiguous. It must be made to an officer having the requisite authority to perform the act demanded. Furthermore, the authority against whom mandamus is issued, should have rejected the demand earlier. Therefore, a demand and its subsequent refusal, either by words, or by conduct, are necessary to satisfy the court that the opposite party is determined to ignore the demand of the applicant with respect to the enforcement of his legal right. However, a demand may not be necessary when the same is manifest from the facts of the case, that is, when it is an empty formality, or when it is obvious that the opposite party would not consider the demand.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\">76-\t\tLearned Counsel for the respondents has submitted that on the request of the petitioner the plot was allotted in her favour and she was directed to deposit the cost of the land, but she failed to deposit the same inspite of certain notices and reminders.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_76\">77-\t\tIt is the version of the petitioner that she was the Member of society and by virtue of agreement between the society and the L.D.A. she is entitled for allotment of plot without payment of any cost to the L.D.A.  There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner had paid any amount towards the allotment of the plot in the account of the L.D.A.  Further there is nothing on record that the petitioner had paid any amount to the society.  Even if anything has been paid to the society L.D.A. is not bound to allot the land on the ground that an amount has been deposited to the society.  The communication order dated 18.6.2014 reveals that plot no.-3/154 Viraj Khand Scheme was allotted in favour of the petitioner on cash down basis and considering the application of the petitioner on payment of rupees 5,57,2,80/-, but she failed to deposit it on or before the date fixed i.e. 28.1.1993 and for default of the payment , she was communicated that the allotment under question has been cancelled.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_77\">78-\t\tLearned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that Special Secretary State of U.P., vide letter dated 19.7.2001 communicated Vice Chairman to the L.D.A. that the possession of the plot, has not been given to the petitioner and  recommended to provide and consider the allotment of plot to the petitioner in Gomti Nagar Yojna subject to condition that she may not be compelled to pay the interest.  \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\">79-\t\tLearned Counsel for the respondent has submitted that this letter is not traceable in the office.   Any way that does not give any right for allotment of any plot or handing over the possession without payment of any cost.  It is admitted fact that petitioner had never paid any amount to the L.D.A. for allotment of plot in proportionate to the value of the cost.  This letter has been challenged by the respondents on two points 1- The letter is not traceable 2- Such type of order cannot be passed by the Special Secretary on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to allot the plot to any individual against the terms and conditions and Rules.  It has further been argued that the plot cannot be alloted free of cost.  State instrumentalities are bound to follow the procedure and equity clause as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 14</a> of Constitution of India. The order is challenged on three grounds firstly on the ground of validity of order , secondly jurisdiction regarding passing the order and thirdly it classifies the person inviolation under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 14</a> of Constitution of India.  The letter is not binding on the L.D.A.  This is not within the domain of the Secretary to direct to L.D.A. to allot or to provide any plot to any person free of cost.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">80-\t\tWhere there is a statutory rules for allotment and there is procedure for allotment of plot by the respondents, statutory rules are required to be observed, thus the action of the respondents, are in accordance with law.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">81-\t\tIt is settled law that when the action of the State or its instrumentalities is not as per the rules or regulations and supported by a statute, the Court must exercise its jurisdiction to declare such an act to be illegal and invalid.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1687907\" id=\"span_81\">82-\t\tIn <a href=\"/doc/1687907/\" id=\"a_146\">Sirsi Municipality Vs.

Any deviation will be enforced by legal sanction of declaration by Courts to invalidate actions in violation of rules and regulations. The existence of rules and regulations under statute is to ensure regular conduct with a distinctive attitude to that conduct as a standard. The statutory regulations in the cases under consideration give the employees a statutory status and impose restrictions on the employer and the employee with no option to vary the conditions............In cases of statutory bodies there is no personal element whatsoever because of the impersonal character of statutory bodies..............the element of public employment or service and the support of statute require observance  of rules and regulations. Failure to observe requirements by statutory bodies is enforced by courts by declaring (action) in violation of rules and regulations  to be void. This Court has repeatedly observed that whenever a man&#x27;s rights are affected by decision taken under statutory powers, the Court would presume the existence of a duty to observe the rules of natural justice and compliance with rules and regulations imposed by statute.&quot; (Emphasis added).\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1008845\" id=\"span_83\">84-\t\tSimilar view has been taken by the Supreme Court in Ambica Quarry Works etc. Vs.

As the statutory provision creates legal rights and obligations for individuals, the statutory authorities are under a legal obligation to give strict adherence to the same and cannot pass an order in contravention thereof, treating the same to be merely decoration pieces in his office.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">92-\t\tLearned Counsel for the petitioner has taken shelter of letter dated 2.3.1995 issued by the Joint Secretary, directing the Chief Engineer for completion of development work.  The impugned letter does not authorize any way for the allotment of plot to the petitioner.  Further the petitioner has taken reliance of the Uttar Pradesh State Control Over Public Corporation Act 1975, whereby the corporation has been directed to be guided by the directions on the question of policies, as may be given to it by the State Government.  The question of allotment of the plot is not a matter of policy, secondly the direction to develop the site does not in any way create a right in favour of the petitioner to give him a right for allotment of the plot.  The petitioner had also relied upon the judgments (1)- 2000(4) AWC 3361 Khurram Carpets Private Ltd. Versus State of U.P. &amp; Others (2) Ugrasen Versus Gaziabad Development Authority (2003) 3 UPEBEC 2049 and argued that the direction given by the State Government is binding on the Lucknow Development Authority.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">93-\t\tThe interpretation of above citations does not create any right in favour of the petitioner for allotment of the plot.

The matter relates to the insurance of the person concerned and does not relate to the allotment of the land.  Secondly, the observations of the Court says that in the field of contractual relation the State, its instrumentalities, should be just and fair.  There is nothing on record to show arbitrariness or violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_176\">21</a> of the Constitution of India or unreasonableness in the order issued by the respondents.  \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">95-\t\tIn Erusian Equipment &amp; Chemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal MANU/SC/0061/1974MANU/SC/0061/1974 : [1975]2SCR674 , the Court held that neither the petitioner nor the respondent has any right to enter into a contract but they are entitled to equal treatment with others who offer tender or quotations for the purchase of the goods services etc.. This privilege arises because it is the Government which trading with the public and the democratic form of Government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions. Privilege is a form of liberty as opposed to a duty. When public element is involved in the activities of the Government, then there should be fairness and equality. If the State does enter into a contract, it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure. Exclusion of a member of the public from dealing, prevents him from entering into lawful contractual relations and discriminates him in favour of other people. Though the State is entitled to impose reasonable conditions but arbitrary conditions prevents entering into contractual relations with the State. The individual is entitled to fair and equal treatment with others. A duty to act fairly can be interpreted as meaning a duty to observe certain aspects of rules of natural justice. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">96-\t In Saghir Ahmad v.

In A. Sanjeevi Naidu v. State of Madras MANU/SC/ 0381/1970MANU /SC/ 0381 /1970 : [1970]3SCR505 , another Constitution Bench held that the acts of the authorised officers are the acts of the State itself and not as the delegates of the Government. In Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India MANU/SC/0048/1979MANU / SC/0048/1979 : (1979)IILLJ217SC , another Constitution Bench held that in a welfare State in regulating and dispensing special services including contracts, the citizen derives rights or privileges by entering into favourable relations with the Government. The Government, therefore, cannot anchor its role as a private person. The exercise of the power or discrimination to award contract etc. must be structured by rational, relevant and non-discriminatory standards or norms. In Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of J &amp; K MANU/SC/0079/ 1980MANU/SC/0079/1980 : [1980]3SCR1338 , it was further held that every activity of the government has a public element in it and it must, therefore, be informed with reason guided by public interest. It cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the State. In M.C. Mehta v. Union of India MANU/SC/0092/ 1986MANU/SC/0092/ 1986 : [1987]1SCR819 , another Constitution Bench held that it is dangerous to exonerate corporations from the need to have constitutional conscience which makes governmental agencies what their mien amenable to constitutional limitations, the Court must adopt such&quot; standards &quot;as against the alternative of permitting them to flourish as an imperium in imperio&quot;. It was further held that law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country. As new situations arise the law has to be evolved in order to meet the challenge of such new situations. Law cannot afford to remain static. The Court has to evolve new principles and lay down new norms which arise in a highly industrialised economy, Therefore, when new challenges are thrown open, the law must grow as a social engineering to meet the challenges and every endeavour should be made to cope with the contemporary demands to meet socio-economic challenges under rule of law and have to be met either by discarding the old and unsuitable or adjusting legal system to the changing socio-economic scenario. Banjaman Cardozo has stated in his &quot;Judicial Process&quot; at p. 168, that &quot;the great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the Judges idle by&quot;.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">97-\t\t Every action of the public authority or the person acting in public interest or its acts give rise to public element, should be guided by public interest.

The Court will examine actions of State if they pertain to the public law domain and refrain from examining them if they pertain to the private law field. The difficulty will lie in demarcating the frontier between the public law domain and the private law field. This is impossible to draw the line with procession and we do not want to attempt it. The question must be decided in each case with reference to the particular action, the activity in which the State or the instrumentality of the State is engaged when performing the action, the public law or private law character of the action and a host of other relevant circumstances.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1058612\" id=\"span_104\">99-\t\t In <a href=\"/doc/1058612/\" id=\"a_177\">Dwarkadas Marfatia &amp; Sons v. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay MANU/SC/0330/1989MANU/SC/</a> 0330/1989 : [1989]2SCR751 , it was held that the Corporation must act in accordance with certain constitutional conscience and whether they have so acted must be discernible from the conduct of such Corporations. Every activity of public authority must be in-formed by reasons and guided by the public interest. All exercises of discretion or power by public authority must be judged by that standard. In that case when the building owned by the port trust was ex-empted from the <a href=\"/doc/679372/\" id=\"a_178\">Rent Act</a>, on terminating the tenancy for development when possession was sought to be taken, it was challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 226</a> that the action of the port trust was arbitrary and no public interest would be served by terminating the tenancy. In that context, this Court held that even in contractual relations the Court cannot ignore that the public authority must have constitutional conscience so that any interpretation put up must be to avoid arbitrary action, lest the authority would be permitted to flourish as imperium a imperio. Whatever be the activity of the public authority, it must meet the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 14</a> and judicial review strikes an arbitrary action.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">100-\t\t In Mahabir Auto Stores v.

The action of the State or its instrumentality can be checked under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 14.</a> Their action must be subject to rule of law. If the governmental action even in the matter of entering or not entering into contracts, fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, the same would be unreasonable. Rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and discrimination, rules of fair play, natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in situation or action by State/instrumentality in dealing with citizens. Even though the rights of the citizens, therefore, are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject to judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair play and natural justice, equality and non-discrimination. It is well settled that there can be &quot;malice in law&quot;. It was also further held that whatever be the act of the public authority in such monopoly or semi-monopoly, it must be subject to rule of law and must be supported by reasons and it should meet the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 14.</a>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">101-\t\t In the sphere of contractual relations the State, its instrumentality, public authorities or those whose acts bear insignia of public element, action to public duty or obligation are enjoined to act in a manner i.e. fair, just and equitable, after taking objectively all the relevant options into consideration and in a manner that is reasonable, relevant and germane to effectuate the purpose for public good and in general public interest and it must not take any irrelevant or irrational factors into consideration or arbitrary in its decision.

The impact of every action is also on public interest. It imposes public law obligation and impress with that character, the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. &quot;It is a different matter that the scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to the adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is made on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_186\">Article 14</a> by alleging that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of contractual obligations would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the basic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_187\">Article 14.</a> To this extent, the obligation is of a public character invariably in every case irrespective of there being any other right or obligation in addition thereto.

The fact that the land was acquired in accordance with Rules and award was declared by the land acquisition officer on 8.1.1988, was known to all including the petitioner and thus in accordance with the provisions as contained in the land acquisition act and discussed above no right title interest is said to be accrued in favour of the petitioner.  Condition no.-5 provides the payment of  rupees 425 per sq. metre to the L.D.A. but the same has not been complied and or nothing has been stated in the form of documents that the said amount has been paid.

Where one knowingly accepts the benefits of a contract, or conveyance, or of an order, he is estopped from denying the validity of, or the binding effect of such contract, or conveyance, or order upon himself. This rule is applied to ensure equity, however, it must not be applied in such a manner, so as to violate the principles of, what is right and, of good conscience. (Vide: Nagubai Ammal and Ors. v. B.

The doctrine of estoppel by election is one among the species of estoppels in pais (or equitable estoppel), which is a rule of equity. By this law, a person may be precluded, by way of his actions, or conduct, or silence when it is his duty to speak, from asserting a right which he would have otherwise had.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1900915\" id=\"span_108\">107-\t\t A party cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the terms of contract, for the reason that contract is a transaction between the two parties and has been entered into with open eyes and understanding the nature of contract. Thus, contract being a creature of an agreement between two or more parties, has to be interpreted giving literal meanings unless, there is some ambiguity therein. The contract is to be interpreted giving the actual meaning to the words contained in the contract and it is not permissible for the court to make a new contract, however is reasonable, if the parties have not made it themselves. It is to be interpreted in such a way that its terms may not be varied. The contract has to be interpreted without giving any outside aid. The terms of the contract have to be construed strictly without altering the nature of the contract, as it may affect the interest of either of the parties adversely.

The purpose of a contract is the interests, objectives, values, policy that the contract is designed to actualise. It comprises joint intent of the parties. Every such contract expresses the autonomy of the contractual parties&#x27; private will. It creates reasonable, legally protected expectations between the parties and reliance on its results. Consistent with the character of purposive interpretation, the court is required to determine the ultimate purpose of a contract primarily by the joint intent of the parties at the time the contract so formed. It is not the intent of a single party; it is the joint intent of both parties and the joint intent of the parties is to be discovered from the entirety of the contract and the circumstances surrounding its formation. As is stated in Anson&#x27;s Law of Contract, &quot;a basic principle of the Common Law of Contract is that the parties are free to determine for themselves what primary obligations they will accept...Today, the position is seen in a different light. Freedom of contract is generally regarded as a reasonable, social, ideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power between the contracting parties can be assumed and no injury is done to the interests of the community at large.&quot; The Court assumes &quot;that the parties to the contract are reasonable persons who seek to achieve reasonable results, fairness and efficiency...In a contract between the joint intent of the parties and the intent of the reasonable person, joint intent trumps, and the Judge should interpret the contract accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_107\">109-\t\tHaving considered the rival contentions of learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as learned Counsel for the respondents, we are of the view that no right title interest have been accrued in favour of the petitioner regarding allotment of the plot as stated in the petition.  Petitioner has failed to establish the case and failed to prove that she had deposited any  amount regarding value of the plot for allotment thus she is not entitled for allotment of plot of L.D.A.  The fact reveals that on the request of the petitioner, she was communicated for allotment of the plot subject to condition of payment of an amount which is more than 17 lakhs, but the same had not been deposited by the petitioner and thus the proposal for allotment of the plot in favour of the petitioner have been cancelled by the L.D.A.  and the same had been communicated to the petitioner.
