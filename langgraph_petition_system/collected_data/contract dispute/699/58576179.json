The\n\nCompany was interested to promote and augment its\n\nsales of lubricants and other products. The appellant,\n\nM/s Swastik Gases (P) Ltd., who deals in storage,\n\ndistribution of petroleum products etc. entered into an\n\nagreement on 13.10.2002, whereby the appellant- M/s\n\nSwastik Gases (P) Ltd., was appointed the Company&#x27;s\n\nconsignment agent for marketing lubricants at Jaipur\n\n(Rajasthan). The disputes arose between the parties.\n\nThe dispute having not amicably resolved, a notice was\n\nsent by the appellant to the Company invoking\n\narbitration clause wherein the name of a retired Judge\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                            16</span>\n\n\nof the High Court was proposed as the appellant&#x27;s\n\narbitrator. The Company was requested to name their\n\narbitrator within thirty days failing which it was stated\n\nthat the appellant would have no option but to proceed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act. The Company did not\n\nnominate its arbitrator within thirty days of receipt of\n\nthe notice dated 25.08.2008 which led to the applicant\n\nmaking an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 11</a> of the 1996\n\nAct in the Rajasthan High Court for the appointment of\n\nthe arbitrator in respect of the disputes arising out of\n\nthe above agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\">      The   agreement    <a href=\"/doc/34412705/\" id=\"a_28\">referred   above</a>   contains   a\n\njurisdiction clause to be at Kolkata. The objection\n\nregarding maintainability of the application filed before\n\nRajasthan High Court was raised taking the jurisdiction\n\nclause to be at Kolkata and the plea was taken that by\n\nvirtue of Clause 18 of the agreement, whether parties\n\nhave agreed to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts at\n\nJaipur or, in other words, in view of Clause 18 of the\n\nagreement, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the\n\nRajasthan High Court has been excluded.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">      The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, in order to scrutinize the\n\naforesaid issue, has considered the effect of the\n\njurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                17</span>\n\n\nthat the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of\n\nthe courts at Kolkata. It has been taken note therein\n\nthat whilst providing for jurisdiction clause in the\n\nagreement the words like ―alone‖, ―only‖, ―exclusive‖ or\n\n―exclusive jurisdiction‖ have not been used but this has\n\nbeen considered not decisive and does not make any\n\nmaterial difference due to the reason that the intention\n\nof the parties--by having Clause 18 in the agreement--\n\nis clear and unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata\n\nshall have jurisdiction which means that the courts at\n\nKolkata alone shall have jurisdiction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">      It has further been observed as under paragraph\n\n32 thereof that for construction of jurisdiction clause,\n\nlike Clause 18 in the agreement, the maxim expressio\n\nunius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there is\n\nnothing to indicate to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">      The    Hon&#x27;ble      Apex      Court,    considering       the\n\naforesaid fact, has observed that the courts at Kolkata\n\nwill have jurisdiction. Paragraph 32 of the aforesaid\n\njudgment reads hereunder as :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;32. For answer to the above question, we have to\n      see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the\n      agreement which provides that the agreement shall\n      be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata. It\n      is a fact that whilst providing for jurisdiction clause\n      in the agreement the words like ―alone‖, ―only‖,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                  18</span>\n\n\n      ―exclusive‖ or ―exclusive jurisdiction‖ have not been\n      used but this, in our view, is not decisive and does\n      not make any material difference. The intention of\n      the   parties--by     having      Clause    18   in   the\n      agreement--is clear and unambiguous that the\n      courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction which\n      means that the courts at Kolkata alone shall have\n      jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of\n      jurisdiction clause, like Clause 18 in the agreement,\n      the      maxim expressio        unius     est   exclusio\n      alterius comes into play as there is nothing to\n      indicate to the contrary. This legal maxim means\n      that expression of one is the exclusion of another.\n      By making a provision that the agreement is subject\n      to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the\n      parties have impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of\n      other courts. Where the contract specifies the\n      jurisdiction of the courts at a particular place and\n      such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the\n      matter, we think that an inference may be drawn\n      that parties intended to exclude all other courts. A\n      clause like this is not hit by <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 23</a> of the\n      Contract Act at all. Such clause is neither forbidden\n      by law nor it is against the public policy. It does not\n      offend <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act in any\n      manner.‖\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">12.   It is, thus, evident from the aforesaid judgment\n\nthat while considering the jurisdiction of the Court at\n\nKolkata, consideration has been given about the\n\nintention of the parties in determining the place of\n\narbitration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">13.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116972057\" id=\"span_27\">In <a href=\"/doc/116972057/\" id=\"a_31\">Brahmani River Pellets Limited v.

This has\n      been made clear in the three-Judge Bench decision\n      in <a href=\"/doc/23112747/\" id=\"a_33\">Swastik Gases (P) Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd.</a>\n         15.1.

The dispute arose between the\n      parties as huge quantity of stock of lubricants could\n      not be sold by the applicant and they could not be\n      resolved amicably.

The respondent\n      contested the application made by Swastik inter alia\n      by raising the plea of lack of territorial jurisdiction of\n      the Rajasthan High Court in the matter. The plea of\n      Indian Oil Corporation was that the agreement has\n      been made subject to jurisdiction of the courts at\n      Kolkata and the Rajasthan High Court lacks the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                           20</span>\n\n\nterritorial jurisdiction in dealing with the application\nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">   15.3.

Pointing out that the words like ―alone‖,\n―only‖, ―exclusive‖ or ―exclusive jurisdiction‖ have\nnot been used in the agreement and use of such\nwords is not decisive and non-use of such words\ndoes not make any material difference as to the\nintention of the parties by having Clause 18 of the\nagreement that the courts at Kolkata shall have the\njurisdiction, the Supreme Court held as under :\n[<a href=\"/doc/23112747/\" id=\"a_37\">Swastik Gases (P) Ltd.</a> case, SCC pp. 47-48, paras\n31-33]\n      ―31. In the instant case, the appellant does not\n   dispute that part of cause of action has arisen in\n   Kolkata. What the appellant says is that part of\n   cause of action has also arisen in Jaipur and,\n   therefore, the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High\n   Court or the designate Judge has jurisdiction to\n   consider the application made by the appellant\n   for the appointment of an arbitrator under\n   <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 11</a>. Having regard to <a href=\"/doc/21958/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 11(12)(b)</a>\n   and <a href=\"/doc/1804257/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2(e)</a> of the 1996 Act read with <a href=\"/doc/385194/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n   20(c)</a> of the Code, there remains no doubt that\n   the Chief Justice or the designate Judge of the\n   Rajasthan High Court has jurisdiction in the\n   matter. The question is, whether parties by virtue\n   of Clause 18 of the agreement have agreed to\n   exclude the jurisdiction of the courts at Jaipur or,\n   in other words, whether in view of Clause 18 of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                           21</span>\n\n\nthe agreement, the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice\nof the Rajasthan High Court has been excluded?</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">    32. For answer to the above question, we have\nto see the effect of the jurisdiction clause in the\nagreement which provides that the agreement\nshall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at\nKolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for\njurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like\n&quot;alone&quot;,    &quot;only&quot;,   &quot;exclusive&quot;           or   &quot;exclusive\njurisdiction&quot; have not been used but this, in our\nview, is not decisive and does not make any\nmaterial difference. The intention of the parties--\nby having Clause 18 in the agreement-- is clear\nand unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall\nhave jurisdiction which means that the courts at\nKolkata alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so\nbecause for construction of jurisdiction clause, like\nClause 18 in the agreement, the maxim expressio\nunius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there\nis nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal\nmaxim means that expression of one is the\nexclusion of another. By making a provision that\nthe agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the\ncourts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly\nexcluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the\ncontract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts at\na   particular    place        and   such    courts   have\njurisdiction to deal with the matter, we think that\nan inference may be drawn that parties intended\nto exclude all other courts. A clause like this is\nnot hit by <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act at all.\nSuch clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is\nagainst the public policy.

After</a> referring to <a href=\"/doc/146487961/\" id=\"a_55\">BALCO, Enercon (India)\nLtd. v. Enercon    GmbH</a>        and <a href=\"/doc/156247141/\" id=\"a_56\">Reliance     Industries\nLtd. v.

The amended Act, does not, however,\n   contain the aforesaid amendments, presumably\n   because the BALCO judgment in no uncertain\n   terms has referred to ―place‖ as ―juridical seat‖ for\n   the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/883201/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 2(2)</a> of the Act. It further\n   made it clear that <a href=\"/doc/280582/\" id=\"a_59\">Sections 20(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436635/\" id=\"a_60\">20(2)</a> where\n   the word ―place‖ is used, refers to ―juridical seat‖,\n   whereas in <a href=\"/doc/80929/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 20(3)</a>, the word ―place‖ is\n   equivalent to ―venue‖.

A    conspectus   of   all   the   aforesaid\nprovisions shows that the moment the seat is\ndesignated, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction\nclause. On the facts of the present case, it is clear\nthat the seat of arbitration is Mumbai and Clause\n19 further makes it clear that jurisdiction\nexclusively vests in the Mumbai courts. Under the\nLaw of Arbitration, unlike <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_62\">the Code of Civil\nProcedure</a> which applies to suits filed in courts, a\nreference to &quot;seat&quot; is a concept by which a neutral\nvenue can be chosen by the parties to an\narbitration clause. The neutral venue may not in\nthe classical sense have jurisdiction -- that is, no\npart of the cause of action may have arisen at the\nneutral venue and neither would any of the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/169730061/\" id=\"a_63\">Sections 16</a> to <a href=\"/doc/51447063/\" id=\"a_64\">21</a> CPC be attracted.\nIn arbitration law however, as has been held\nabove, the moment &quot;seat&quot; is determined, the fact\nthat the seat is at Mumbai would vest Mumbai\ncourts with exclusive jurisdiction for purposes of\nregulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the\nagreement between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170532980\" id=\"span_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23112747\" id=\"span_47\">20.

The term ―subject-matter‖ in\n      <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 2(1)(e)</a> is confined to Part I. It has a\n      reference and connection with the process of\n      dispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the\n      courts     having    supervisory     control   over   the\n      arbitration proceedings. Hence, it refers to a court\n      which would essentially be a court of the seat of the\n      arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in\n      <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 2(1)(e)</a> has to be construed keeping in view\n      the provisions in <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 20</a> which give recognition\n      to    party    autonomy.        Accepting   the   narrow\n      construction as projected by the learned counsel for\n      the appellants would, in fact, render <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 20</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                 <a href=\"/doc/1295756/\" id=\"a_94\">30</a></span>\n\n\n      nugatory.    In   our   view,    the   legislature    has\n      intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the\n      court which would have jurisdiction where the\n      cause of action is located and the courts where the\n      arbitration takes place. This was necessary as on\n      many occasions the agreement may provide for a\n      seat of arbitration at a place which would be\n      neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courts\n      where the arbitration takes place would be required\n      to exercise supervisory control over the arbitral\n      process. For example, if the arbitration is held in\n      Delhi, where neither of the parties are from Delhi,\n      (Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as\n      between a party from Mumbai and the other from\n      Kolkata) and the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an\n      interim order under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 17</a> of the Arbitration\n      Act, 1996, the appeal against such an interim order\n      under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 37</a> must lie to the courts of Delhi\n      being the courts having supervisory jurisdiction\n      over the arbitration proceedings and the tribunal.\n      This would be irrespective of the fact that the\n      obligations to be performed under the contract were\n      to be performed either at Mumbai or at Kolkata,\n      and only arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In\n      such circumstances, both the courts would have\n      jurisdiction i.e. the court within whose jurisdiction\n      the subject-matter of the suit is situated and the\n      courts within the jurisdiction of which the dispute\n      resolution i.e. arbitration is located.‖\n\n      It   is   evident    from      the   aforesaid       paragraph\n\nwherein it has been observed that the provision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/574497/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 2(1)(e)</a> has to be construed keeping in view the\n\nprovisions in <a href=\"/doc/385194/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 20</a> which give recognition to party\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                 31</span>\n\n\nautonomy.

The amended Act, does not, however,\ncontain the aforesaid amendments, presumably\nbecause    the BALCO judgment             in    no    uncertain\nterms has referred to ―place‖ as ―juridical seat‖ for\nthe purpose of <a href=\"/doc/883201/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 2(2)</a> of the Act.

This being the settled law, it\nwas found unnecessary to expressly incorporate\nwhat the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court\nhas already done by way of construction of the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">   19. A conspectus of all the aforesaid provisions\nshows that the moment the seat is designated, it is\nakin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. On the\nfacts of the present case, it is clear that the seat of\narbitration is Mumbai and Clause 19 further makes\nit clear that jurisdiction exclusively vests in the\nMumbai courts. Under the Law of Arbitration,\nunlike <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_108\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> which applies to\nsuits filed in courts, a reference to ―seat‖ is a\nconcept by which a neutral venue can be chosen by\nthe parties to an arbitration clause. The neutral\nvenue   may      not   in   the    classical      sense    have\njurisdiction -- that is, no part of the cause of action\nmay have arisen at the neutral venue and neither\nwould any of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/169730061/\" id=\"a_109\">Sections 16</a> to <a href=\"/doc/51447063/\" id=\"a_110\">21</a> of\nCPC be attracted. In arbitration law however, as\nhas   been     held    above,     the   moment        ―seat‖   is\ndetermined, the fact that the seat is at Mumbai\nwould     vest    Mumbai         courts        with   exclusive\njurisdiction for purposes of regulating arbitral\nproceedings arising out of the agreement between\nthe parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170532980\" id=\"span_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23112747\" id=\"span_72\">20.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has\n       submitted that a perusal of Clause 17.1 of MoU\n       makes    it        clear   that    the   petitioner    and    the\n       respondent have only agreed that the proper law of\n       the contract to be laws of India and MoU is clearly\n       silent on the proper law and the curial law of the\n       arbitration and therefore, Clause 17.1 would govern\n       the proper law and the curial law. According to the\n       petitioner, there is no express or implied exclusion\n       either in Clause 17 or under the entire MoU of the\n       non-applicability of the laws of India and/or the\n       applicability of the laws of Hong Kong or any other\n       country. The contention of the petitioner is that in\n       the absence of the clear stipulation as to the proper\n       law and curial law of the arbitration, laws of India\n       should be taken as the proper law and curial law\n       under MoU and under no circumstances, the terms\n       in Clause 17.1 of MoU be undermined or diluted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">          20. It is well settled that ―seat of arbitration‖ and\n       ―venue        of      arbitration‖       cannot       be     used\n       interchangeably. It has also been established that\n       mere expression ―place of arbitration‖ cannot be the\n       basis to determine the intention of the parties that\n       they have intended that place as the ―seat‖ of\n       arbitration. The intention of the parties as to the\n       ―seat‖ should be determined from other clauses in\n       the agreement and the conduct of the parties.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                 35</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">           22. As pointed out earlier, Clause 17.2 of MoU\n      stipulates that the dispute arising out of or relating\n      to    MoU     including    the   existence,   validity,\n      interpretation, breach or termination thereof or any\n      dispute arising out of or relating to it shall be\n      referred to and finally resolved by the arbitration\n      administered in Hong Kong. The words in Clause\n      17.2 that ―arbitration administered in Hong Kong‖\n      is an indicia that the seat of arbitration is at Hong\n      Kong. Once the parties have chosen ―Hong Kong‖ as\n      the place of arbitration to be administered in Hong\n      Kong, the laws of Hong Kong would govern the\n      arbitration. The Indian courts have no jurisdiction\n      for appointment of the arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">      It is evident from paragraph 19 thereof that the\n\nseat of arbitration has been considered to be a vital\n\naspect of any arbitration proceedings, since, the\n\nsignificance of the seat of arbitration is that it\n\ndetermines the applicable law while deciding the\n\narbitration proceedings and arbitration procedure as\n\nwell as judicial review over the arbitration award.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">      Further, as would appear from paragraph 20\n\nthereof wherein the position of law as is settled that\n\n―seat of arbitration‖ and ―venue of arbitration‖ cannot\n\nbe used interchangeably. It has further been observed\n\nthat mere expression ―place of arbitration‖ cannot be\n\nthe basis to determine the intention of the parties that\n\nthey have intended that place as the ―seat‖ of\n\narbitration. The intention of the parties as to the ―seat‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                             36</span>\n\n\nshould be determined from other clauses in the\n\nagreement and the conduct of the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">       However, it is evident from paragraph 20 thereof\n\nthat the words in Clause 17.2 that ―arbitration\n\nadministered in Hong Kong‖ is an indicia that the seat\n\nof arbitration is at Hong Kong. Once the parties have\n\nchosen ―Hong Kong‖ as the place of arbitration to be\n\nadministered in Hong Kong, the laws of Hong Kong\n\nwould govern the arbitration. The Indian courts have no\n\njurisdiction for appointment of the arbitrator.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"34412705\" id=\"span_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"143184125\" id=\"span_80\">The judgment rendered by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/143184125/\" id=\"a_120\">BGS SGS Soma JV v.

Indian Oil Corporation Limited (Supra</a>)\n\nlike   ―alone‖,   ―only‖,   ―exclusive‖   or      ―exclusive\n\njurisdiction‖ are not decisive and does not make any\n\nmaterial difference, at paragraph 82 it has been held\n\ntherein that whenever there is the designation of a\n\nplace of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the\n\n―venue‖ of the arbitration proceedings, the expression\n\n―arbitration proceedings‖ would make it clear that the\n\n―venue‖ is really the ―seat‖ of the arbitral proceedings,\n\nas the aforesaid expression does not include just one or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                  37</span>\n\n\nmore    individual        or   particular     hearing,         but   the\n\narbitration proceedings as a whole, including the\n\nmaking of an award at that place. However, the said\n\nprinciple will be coupled with there being no other\n\nsignificant contrary indicia that the stated venue is\n\nmerely a ―venue‖ and not the ―seat‖ of the arbitral\n\nproceedings, would then conclusively show that such a\n\nclause designates a ―seat‖ of the arbitral proceedings.\n\nParagraph 82 reads hereunder as :-</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       ―82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it\n       may be concluded that whenever there is the\n       designation   of    a   place   of   arbitration   in    an\n       arbitration clause as being the ―venue‖ of the\n       arbitration proceedings, the expression ―arbitration\n       proceedings‖ would make it clear that the ―venue‖ is\n       really the ―seat‖ of the arbitral proceedings, as the\n       aforesaid expression does not include just one or\n       more individual or particular hearing, but the\n       arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the\n       making of an award at that place. This language\n       has to be contrasted with language such as\n       ―tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or\n       the parties‖ where only hearings are to take place in\n       the ―venue‖, which may lead to the conclusion,\n       other things being equal, that the venue so stated is\n       not the ―seat‖ of arbitral proceedings, but only a\n       convenient place of meeting. Further, the fact that\n       the arbitral proceedings ―shall be held‖ at a\n       particular venue would also indicate that the\n       parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a\n       particular place, signifying thereby, that that place\n       is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                 38</span>\n\n\n      with there being no other significant contrary\n      indicia that the stated venue is merely a ―venue‖\n      and not the ―seat‖ of the arbitral proceedings, would\n      then    conclusively    show   that   such    a   clause\n      designates a ―seat‖ of the arbitral proceedings. In an\n      international context, if a supranational body of\n      rules is to govern the arbitration, this would further\n      be an indicia that ―the venue‖, so stated, would be\n      the seat of the arbitral proceedings. In a national\n      context, this would be replaced by the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_122\">Arbitration\n      Act, 1996</a> as applying to the ―stated venue‖, which\n      then becomes the ―seat‖ for the purposes of\n      arbitration.‖\n\n      It is, thus, evident from the aforesaid judgment\n\nfrom which it can well be inferred that whenever there\n\nis a designation of the place of arbitration in an\n\narbitration    clause    as    being    the   ―venue‖       of   the\n\narbitration    proceeding,     the     expression       ―arbitration\n\nproceeding‖ would make it clear that ―venue‖ is really\n\nthe seat of arbitral proceeding as the aforesaid\n\nexpression does not include just one or more individual\n\nor particular hearing. However, the same will have\n\ndifferent impact if there is contrary indicia and in that\n\ncontext, the stated venue is merely a venue and not a\n\nseat of the arbitration proceeding.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"143184125\" id=\"span_83\">14.

The question may arise for what dispute Clause\n\nG.1 has been inserted?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">20.      According to the considered view of this Court,\n\nthe intent of the contract is by making available two\n\nrecourses to the parties concerned, i.e., by pursuing the\n\ncivil        suit    or     by     resolution      of     dispute   through\n\narbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">         Therefore, the intent of the parties, so far as it\n\nrelates to insertion of the condition stipulated under\n\nPart-G will have importance, if the parties will pursue\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                               43</span>\n\n\ncivil suit for resolution of dispute but if the parties\n\nchose    to   settle   the   dispute   through   arbitration\n\nmechanism by taking recourse of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_129\">Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996</a>, the intent of the parties will be\n\nas per Part-H, i.e., to take recourse of arbitration\n\nproceeding and hence, considering the intention of the\n\nparties while entering into the contract, two clauses\n\nhave been stipulated in the agreement. In Part-G, if the\n\nparties will take recourse to file civil suit then the\n\njurisdiction, has been carved out to the court, at\n\nLohardaga but in case the parties will intend to\n\nadjudicate the dispute through arbitration mechanism,\n\nthe parties have intended to insert the arbitration\n\nclause as is stipulated under Part-H, therefore, the\n\nscope of Part-G and Part-H of the contract is quite\n\ndifferent and hence, the jurisdiction to the district court\n\nat Lohardaga cannot construed to be a contrary indicia\n\nfor the purpose of ousting the jurisdiction of arbitration\n\nproceeding as stipulated under Part-H.\n\n        It further requires to refer herein that if the\n\ncondition stipulated under Part-G is considered to be\n\ncontrary indicia, the question will arise that why the\n\nreference of district court at Lohardaga has been\n\nmentioned and why not the other district?\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                              44</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">      The reason is obvious that the district court at\n\nLohardaga has been carved out with the exclusive\n\njurisdiction based upon the intention of the parties that\n\nsince the cause of action occurs in the mining work\n\nwithin the district of Lohardaga and as such, if the\n\nparty will intend to file a civil suit then the court at\n\nLohardaga will have only jurisdiction and no other\n\ncourts situated in different districts of the State of\n\nJharkhand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">      Admittedly, the petitioner is not resorting to\n\npursue the civil suit and as such, there is no question\n\nof applicability of Clause G.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">      However,     since    the      petitioner/applicant   is\n\nresorting to the arbitration clause by filing the instant\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996, as\n\nsuch, Clause H.1 will be applicable and hence, it\n\ncannot be said, as has been taken as a ground on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner/applicant that the condition\n\nstipulated under Clause G.1 is to be treated as\n\nexclusive jurisdiction treating it as a contrary indicia\n\nand, therefore, this Court will have jurisdiction to\n\nentertain the instant applications, is not worth to be\n\nconsidered, since the petitioner/applicant has resorted\n\nfor   resolution   of      dispute     through    arbitration\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                             45</span>\n\n\nmechanism, wherein the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_131\">Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996</a> is to be made applicable and in that view of\n\nthe matter, it is only the Clause H.1 which will be\n\napplicable and the parties have agreed for place of\n\narbitration   at   Renukoot      which   falls   within   the\n\njurisdiction of the State of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">      This Court is further of the view that Clause G.1\n\nwhich confers jurisdiction upon the district courts at\n\nLohardaga, cannot be treated to be contrary indicia\n\nousting the arbitration clause in view of the finding\n\nrecorded by this Court to the effect that if the\n\npetitioner/applicant will resort for pursuing the civil\n\nsuit for redressal of dispute, which is entirely in the\n\ndifferent field since therein the provision <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_132\">of Code of Civil\n\nProcedure</a> will be applicable and hence, the same\n\ncannot be considered to be contrary indicia.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"143184125\" id=\"span_95\">21.
