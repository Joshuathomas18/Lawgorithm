It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner is\n\na    Partnership     Firm     engaged       in   the   business     of\n\nconstruction       and      property        development.          The\n\nrespondent     was       desirous      of     having   its     factory\n\nconstructed in Malur, Karnataka and consequently had\n\nfloated a tender on 17/08/2011 inviting bids for the\n\nconstruction       project.     The         petitioner&#x27;s     Associate\n\nCompany by name M/s. URC Constructions Private\n\nLimited., had participated in the tender and submission\n\nof tender was made on 26/08/2011 and final offer was\n\nfinalized on 26/09/2011 and M/s. URC Constructions\n\nPrivate Limited was declared as a successful bidder.\n\nThereafter, the successful bidder has requested the\n\nrespondent that the contract be executed by the\n\npetitioner in their final offer letter dated 26/09/2011.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               4</span>\n\nAccordingly, both the parties have entered into an\n\nagreement (construction contract         agreement) dated\n\n22/10/2011.       The details of the work to be executed\n\nand the manner it had to be carried out were detailed in\n\nthe said agreement. Clause 16(b) of the said agreement\n\nmakes it clear that all other conditions governing the\n\nrelationship between the petitioner and the respondent\n\nwould be as per the tender document.          In addition to\n\nthe work order dated 22/10/2011, the petitioner and\n\nthe respondent entered into an agreement, which clearly\n\nstated that all previous contract documents floated by\n\nthe petitioner in conjunction with addendum to the\n\ntender document would be deemed to form and be read\n\nand construed to be a part of the agreement dated\n\n22/10/2011.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">3.      It is further case of the petitioner is that the work\n\norder     dated     22/10/2011      stipulates    that   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                            5</span>\n\ncommencement of work was 15 days from the date of\n\nissue of work order and date of completion was\n\n13/07/2012 i.e., 250 days from the date of issue of\n\nwork order including mobilization period. The contract\n\namount as per the work order was Rs.30,65,51,682/-.\n\nIt is also the terms of the contract under 2.9 of the\n\nconditions of the contract clause-9 that the contractor\n\nshall also conform exactly, fully and faithfully to the\n\ndesigns, drawings and instructions in writing relating to\n\nthe work signed by the project consultant or other\n\ncompetent Authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.   It is further case of the petitioner that in view of\n\nthe disputes with regard to delay of the project, there\n\nwas Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the\n\npetitioner and respondent and in terms of MoU dated\n\n01/08/2014, parties entered into as a pre condition for\n\nreleasing the legitimate dues of the petitioner. In any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  6</span>\n\nevent, the petitioner is entitled to receive various\n\npayments for the works executed for the respondent and\n\nmerely    because    the   MoU        was   entered   into,    the\n\nacceptable claims of the petitioner cannot be rejected\n\nciting the said MoU.       Ultimately the petitioner issued\n\nlegal notice dated 26/07/2016 to the respondent under\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/153260/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Act. The same was\n\nreplied by the respondent.             Therefore, the present\n\npetition is filed as relief sought for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">5.    The respondent filed statement of objections\n\ndenying the averments made in the petition and\n\ncontended that the very petition is not maintainable. It\n\nis further contended that the petitioner who was\n\nappointed as the contractor for construction of the\n\nfactory   building    of   the       respondent   herein,     after\n\ncompletion of the contractual obligation and the expiry\n\nof the defect liability period, entered into MoU dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                   7</span>\n\n01/08/2014      with      the     respondent,       wherein     the\n\npetitioner    who   had     certain       claims    against     the\n\nrespondent     received     the       entire   balance     amount\n\nreceivable by aggregating to Rs.10 lakhs towards full\n\nand   final   settlement    of    their    claims    against    the\n\nrespondent     herein.          Subsequently,       MoU,      dated\n\n01/08/2014 supersedes the earlier agreement dated\n\n22/10/2011 and therefore, the petitioner is not entitled\n\nto invoke the earlier agreement dated 22/10/2011. The\n\nMoU has no arbitration clause, on that ground the\n\npetition is liable to be rejected. It is further contended\n\nthat the petitioner has issued the protest letter only\n\nafter one year two months, once the parties entered into\n\nMoU and after receiving entire amount, the very petition\n\nfiled as relief sought for appointment of Sole Arbitrator\n\nwould not arise.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                             8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">6.    I have heard the learned counsel for the parties to\n\nthe lis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">7.    Sri. A.S.Mahesh, learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nreiterating the grounds urged in the civil miscellaneous\n\npetition contended that it is a undisputed fact that there\n\nwas an agreement as construction contract agreement\n\ndated 22/10/2011 between the parties and there exists\n\nclause 1.5.4.36 with regard to dispute if any between\n\nthe parties to resolve the same.      He would further\n\ncontended that since there was a delay in completion of\n\nwork about 250 days from date of issue of work order\n\nincluding mobilization period, the parties entered into\n\nMoU only for settlement of LD (Liquidity Damage) claim\n\nand not in respect of the claim made in the agreement\n\ndated 22/10/2011, in fact, the petitioner has issued the\n\nprotest letter on 07/10/2015.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 9</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">8.   He further contended that MoU never supersedes\n\nthe earlier agreement dated 22/10/2011 and still in\n\nview of the arbitration clause an agreement exists and\n\nthe present petition is maintainable.               Therefore, he\n\nsought to allow the petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">9.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1579938\" id=\"span_8\">In support of his contentions, the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner relied upon the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1579938/\" id=\"a_3\">CHAIRMAN AND MD,\n\nNTPC LTD. vs. RESHMI CONSTRUCTIONS, BUILDERS\n\n&amp; CONTRACTORS</a> reported in (2004) 2 SCC 663.\n\nParagraph 18 of <a href=\"/doc/1579938/\" id=\"a_4\">the said judgment</a> reads as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;18.   Normally, an accord and satisfaction by\n     itself would not affect the arbitration clause but if\n     the dispute is that the contract itself does not\n     subsist, the question of invoking the arbitration\n     clause may not arise. But in the event it be held\n     that   the   contract   survives,   recourse    to   the\n     arbitration clause may be taken. (See Union of\n     India v. Kishorilal Gupta7 and Naihati Jute Mills Ltd.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     v. Khyaliram Jagannath8.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                              10</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">10.     Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent\n\nwhile    justifying the   statement     of objections filed,\n\ncontended that once MoU dated 01/08/2014 entered\n\ninto between the parties the earlier agreement dated\n\n22/10/2011      entered     by    the   parties     supersedes.\n\nTherefore, learned counsel contends that the petitioner\n\ncannot     maintain   the    present    civil     miscellaneous\n\npetition. In fact, he draws the attention of this Court\n\nabout clause-9 of the MoU dated 01/08/2014, where it\n\nis stated that &quot;This agreement represents full and final\n\nsettlement between Devi Constructions and FWL of\n\nmatters pertaining to the Malur Factory constructions\n\nunder the POs and amendments referred above&quot;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">11.     He would further submits that the petitioner\n\ncannot enforce the arbitration clause 1.5.4.36 of the\n\nagreement dated 22/10/2011, as agreement is not\n\nexisting as on today. It is his further contention that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                            11</span>\n\nthe petitioner has entered into MoU on 01/08/2014 but\n\nhe has issued the protest letter only on 07/10/2015\n\nafter lapse of one year two months, it is only an\n\nafterthought.   Therefore, the present petition is not\n\nmaintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">12.   In support of his contentions, learned counsel for\n\nthe respondent relied upon the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of NATHANI STEELS LTD.\n\nvs. ASSOCIATED CONSTRUCTIONS reported in 1995\n\nSupp (3) SCC 324, paragraphs 3 and 4 to the effect that\n\nonce there is full and final settlement in respect of any\n\nparticular dispute or difference in relation to a matter\n\ncovered under the Arbitration clause in the contract and\n\nthat dispute or difference is finally settled by and\n\nbetween the parties, such a dispute or difference does\n\nnot remain to be an arbitrable dispute and the\n\nArbitration clause cannot be invoked even though for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                              12</span>\n\ncertain   other   matters,   the   contract   may   be   in\n\nsubsistence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"19604233\" id=\"span_12\">13.   He also further relied upon another judgment of\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_5\">NEW INDIA\n\nASSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED vs. GENUS POWER\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE LIMITED</a> reported in (2015) 2 SCC\n\n424, paragraphs 9 and 10 to the effect that there was\n\nno protest or demur raised around the time or soon\n\nafter the letter of subrogation was signed, that the\n\nnotice dated 31-3-2011 itself was nearly after three\n\nweeks and that the financial condition of the respondent\n\nwas not so precarious that it was left with no alternative\n\nbut to accept the terms as suggested, we are of the firm\n\nview that the discharge in the present case and signing\n\nof letter of subrogation were not because of exercise of\n\nany undue influence. Upon the execution of the letter of\n\nsubrogation, there was full and final settlement of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                            13</span>\n\nclaim.      Therefore, there was no arbitrable dispute\n\nexisted so as to exercise power under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11</a> of the\n\nAct.     Hence, he sought for dismissal of the present\n\npetition.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">14.    Having heard the learned counsel for the parties,\n\nit is an undisputed fact that the petitioner and the\n\nrespondent      have   entered    into   an    agreement\n\n(construction contract agreement) dated 22/10/2011 in\n\nrespect of certain work to be executed and the manner\n\nit had to be carried out were detailed in the said\n\nagreement. Clause 16(b) of the said agreement makes it\n\nclear that all other conditions governing the relationship\n\nbetween the petitioner and the respondent would be as\n\nper the tender document.     Since there was a delay in\n\ncompletion of project, the parties entered into MoU on\n\n01/08/2014, duly signed by both the parties. The MoU\n\nclearly depicts that &quot;Subject: Settlement of LD claim and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                               14</span>\n\n\n\nReference: (i) Tender Document and Devi Constructions&#x27;\n\nfinal offer dated 26/09/2011;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">(ii) Fowler Westrup (India) Private Limited, (henceforth\n\nabbreviated     to    FWL)    P.O.No.4600001107    dated\n\n22/10/2011      on     Devi   Constructions   (henceforth\n\nabbreviated to DC) and its subsequent amendment\n\nmade on 30/03/2013;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">(iii) Various letter/mail correspondence between Devi\n\nConstructions        and   FWL     between    13/10/2014\n\npertaining to Liquidity Damage and settlement of\n\nbalance payment. The background also clearly stated in\n\nMoU that whereas FWL has raised the LD claim on Devi\n\nConstructions vide letter dated 11/02/2014 for the\n\ndelay in completion of the project as per the provisions\n\nof the above referred tender document and purchase\n\norder.   Whereas Devi Constructions has replied vide\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                15</span>\n\nletter dated 21/02/2014 stating that the delay in\n\ncompleting the project is due to late receipt of drawings\n\nfrom the Architect and a few additions from the client\n\ncompany     and    requested     FWL       for    waiver   of    LD.\n\nThereafter, parties agreed for payment of Rs.30 lakhs of\n\nliquidity   damage     payable        by      petitioner   to     the\n\nrespondent.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">15.   Though Sri. Rajendra.M.S., learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent      stresses   the        clause-9,     wherein       the\n\nagreement represents full and final settlement between\n\nDevi Constructions and FWL of matters pertaining to\n\nthe Malur Factory constructions under the POs and\n\namendments <a href=\"/doc/19604233/\" id=\"a_7\">referred above</a>. The entire document does\n\nnot   depicts   the   wiping     of     the    agreement        dated\n\n22/10/2011 or supersedes the arbitrary clause entered\n\nbetween the parties. Though in the legal notice issued\n\nby the petitioner to the respondent it is stated that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                            16</span>\n\nMoU was with regard to LD claim but he has not stated\n\nthat he made a protest, but the fact remains, the\n\npetitioner want to invoke the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/153260/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 7(5)</a>\n\nof the Act for appointment of Sole Arbitrator to resolve\n\nthe dispute between the parties in terms of clause\n\n1.5.4.36 of the agreement dated 22/10/2011 is also not\n\nin dispute for which reply was issued by respondent. In\n\nfact, the correspondence made by the respondent at\n\nAnnexure-R2 dated 11/02/2014, it is clearly stated that\n\nclaim under LD clause of work order and nowhere in the\n\ncorrespondence the respondent has stated that in view\n\nof the subsequent MoU entered into between the parties\n\nsupersedes the earlier agreement dated 22/10/2011\n\nincluding existence of arbitration clause.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">16.   Though Sri. Rajendra.M.S., learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent stresses his argument with regard to full\n\nand final settlement between the parties in clause-9 of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                 17</span>\n\nMoU dated 01/08/2014 and with reference to the\n\njudgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court as stated supra\n\nin   the     case    of   NATHANI     STEELS     LTD.     vs.\n\nASSOCIATED CONSTRUCTIONS reported in 1995 (3)\n\nSCC 324, it was a case that once dispute is amicably\n\nsettled between the parties finally, arbitration clause\n\ncannot be invoked by a party to resolve the same on\n\nground of mistake in the settlement. No doubt, it is well\n\nsettled law that once there is a full and final settlement\n\nin respect of any particular dispute or difference in\n\nrelation to a matter covered under the arbitration clause\n\nin the contract and that dispute or difference is finally\n\nsettled by and between the parties, such a dispute or\n\ndifference does not remain to be an arbitrable dispute.\n\nAdmittedly, in the present case there is no full and final\n\nsettlement between the parties in respect of dispute\n\nunder      the   construction   contract   agreement    dated\n\n22/10/2011 and arbitration clause referred therein.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                      18</span>\n\nThe MoU was only with respect to settlement of LD\n\nclaim     for     the   delay    of   the       construction    period.\n\nTherefore, there is no full and final settlement between\n\nthe     parties    with    regard         to   construction    contract\n\nagreement         dated    22/10/2011.

On the arguments of learned counsel for\n     the parties, the questions that arise for our\n     consideration are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            (i)     Whether after the contract comes to\n     an end by completion of the contract work and\n     acceptance of the final bill in full and final\n     satisfaction and after issuing a No-Demand\n     Certificate by the contractor, can any party to the\n     contract raise any dispute for reference to\n     arbitration?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            (ii)    Whether in view of letter dated\n     20-12-1990 sent by the respondent contractor the\n     arbitration clause contained in the agreement can\n     be invoked?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">            (iii)   Whether the arbitration clause in the\n     agreement has perished with the contract?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">     27.    Even when rights and obligations of the\n     parties are worked out, the contract does not\n     come to an end inter alia for the purpose of\n     determination of the disputes arising thereunder,\n     and, thus, the arbitration agreement can be\n     invoked. Although it may not be strictly in place\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                           21</span>\n\nbut we cannot shut our eyes to the ground reality\nthat in a case where a contractor has made huge\ninvestment, he cannot afford not to take from the\nemployer the amount under the bills, for various\nreasons which may include discharge of his\nliability towards the banks, financial institutions\nand other persons. In such a situation, the public\nsector undertakings would have an upper hand.\nThey would not ordinarily release the money\nunless a &quot;No-Demand Certificate&quot; is signed.

The fact situation in the present case,\nwould lead to the conclusion that the arbitration\nagreement subsists because:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       (i)    Disputes as regards final bill arose\nprior to its acceptance thereof in view of the fact\nthat the same was prepared by the respondent\nbut was not agreed upon in its entirety by the\nappellant herein.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       (ii)   The appellant has not pleaded that\nupon    submission   of   the   final   bill   by   the\nrespondent herein any negotiation or settlement\ntook place as a result whereof the final bill, as\nprepared by the appellant, was accepted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                              22</span>\n\nrespondent        unequivocally      and   without    any\nreservation therefor.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        (iii)   The respondent herein, immediately\nafter receiving the payment of the final bill,\nlodged its protest and reiterated its claims.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        (vi)    Interpretation and/or application of\nclause 52 of the agreement would constitute a\ndispute which would fall for consideration of the\narbitrator.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        (v)     The effect of the correspondences\nbetween the parties would have to be determined\nby the arbitrator, particularly as regards the\nclaim of the respondent that the final bill was\naccepted by it without prejudice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        (vi)    The appellant never made out a case\nthat any novation of the contract agreement took\nplace    or     that   the   contract    agreement    was\nsubstituted by a new agreement.

In view of the aforestated reasons, it is clear that\n\nthe petitioner has not received full and final settlement\n\nin terms of construction contract agreement dated\n\n22/10/2011. The MoU dated 01/08/2014 is only with\n\nregard to settlement of LD claim. Therefore, the\n\narbitration clause in terms of 1.5.4.36 of the agreement\n\ndated 22/10/2011 still exists and it has to be\n\nadjudicated between the parties by an Arbitrator. The\n\npetitioner has made out the existence of the agreement\n\ndated 22/10/2011, arbitration clause and has complied\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/74115/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Act.
