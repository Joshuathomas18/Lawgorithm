Sri.K.R.Anand, learned counsel for the employer\n\n     submits that\n\n     8.1. The labour court mistook and misunderstood\n\n           the issues framed and consequently travelled\n\n           beyond the reference made and as such, the\n\n           award passed, being beyond the reference, is\n\n           required to be set- aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">     8.2.

The burden of proof was on the workmen to\n\n     establish the employer-employee relationship,\n\n     insofar as the employer is concerned, the\n\n     employer     by    the    production    of   necessary\n\n     document, has categorically established that\n\n     the   workmen       were    the   employees      of   a\n\n     contractor and not employed by the employer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">8.4.

Our conclusions and answers to the questions\nraised are, therefore, as follows :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">[i] In view of the provisions of Section 10 of the Act,\nit is only the appropriate Government which has the\nauthority to abolish genuine labour contract in\naccordance with the provisions of the said Section.\nNo Court including the industrial adjudicator has\njurisdiction to do so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">[ii] if the contract is sham or not genuine, the\nworkmen of the so called contractor can raise an\nindustrial dispute for declaring that they were\nalways the employees of the principal employer and\nfor claiming the appropriate service conditions.\nWhen such dispute is raised, it is not a dispute for\nabolition of the labour contract and hence the\nprovisions of Section 10 of the Act will not bar either\nthe raising or the adjudication of the dispute. When\nsuch dispute is raised, the industrial adjudicator has\nto decide whether the contract is sham or genuine.\nIt is only if the adjudicator comes to the conclusion\nthat the contract is sham, that he will have\njurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. If, however,\nhe comes to the conclusion that the contract is\ngenuine, he may refer the workmen to the\nappropriate Government for abolition of the contract\nlabour under Section 10 of the Act and keep the\ndispute pending. However, he can do so if the\ndispute is espoused by the direct workmen of the\nprincipal employer. If the workmen of the principal\nemployer have not espoused the dispute, the\nadjudicator, after coming to the conclusion that the\ncontract is genuine, has to reject the reference, the\ndispute being not an industrial dispute within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 2 (k)</a> of the ID Act. He will not\nbe competent to give any relief to the workmen of\nthe erstwhile contractor even if the labour contract\nis abolished by the appropriate Government under\n<a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 10</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                          - 14 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                      WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                  C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       [iii] If the labour contract is genuine a composite\n       industrial dispute can still be raised for abolition of\n       the contract labour and their absorption. However,\n       the dispute, will have to be raised invariably by the\n       direct employees of the principal employer. The\n       industrial adjudicator, after receipt of the reference\n       of such dispute will have first to direct the workmen\n       to approach the appropriate Government for\n       abolition of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 10</a> of\n       the Act and keep the reference pending. If pursuant\n       to such reference, the contract labour is abolished\n       by the appropriate Government, the industrial\n       adjudicator will have to give opportunity to the\n       parties to place the necessary material before him\n       to decide whether the workmen of the erstwhile\n       contractor should be directed to be absorbed by the\n       principal employer, how many of them and on what\n       terms.

When\nMr A.K. Sen, counsel for the appellant, raised this\nground, it was urged by Mr Gopalakrishnan on\nbehalf of the respondents that this ground was\nbeing taken for the first time in this Court and had\nnot been raised at any earlier stage, so that it\nshould not be allowed to be taken in this Court. It,\nhowever, appears that the question of jurisdiction\nof the State Government to refer the demand for\nreinstatement for adjudication to the Tribunal was\nspecifically urged in the High Court and the High\nCourt actually dealt with it in its judgment,\ndismissing the petition filed on behalf of the\nappellant. The High Court clearly mentions that\nthe counsel for the appellant contended that the\nIndustrial Tribunal had no jurisdiction as the\nquestion referred to it and which it was called\nupon to adjudicate relating to reinstatement of\nRespondent 3 in the service of the Corporation\nwould not fall within the scope of Item 3 in the\n<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_13\">Second Schedule to the Industrial Disputes Act,\n1947</a>. It was further urged that, since the third\nrespondent was neither discharged nor dismissed\nby the appellant, the question of relief of\nreinstatement would not arise under that item\nand, there being no item under which the demand\nwould fall, the State Government had no\njurisdiction to refer such a demand for\nadjudication to the Tribunal. These points urged\nbefore the High Court would cover the ground now\nurged by Mr Sen before us. It is true that the form\nin which it was urged before the High Court was\nslightly different. There, the point raised was that\na demand for reinstatement, when there had been\nretrenchment only and no discharge or dismissal,\ncould not be held to constitute an industrial\ndispute. On the facts of the case as they appeared\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                - 19 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                            WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                        C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">from the material before the Tribunal, it is now\nurged that, in fact, the demand, which was being\npressed with the management by both the\nrespondents, was in respect of retrenchment\ncompensation and not reinstatement. The demand\nfor reinstatement seems to have been given up,\nbecause the respondents realised that the services\nof Respondent 3 had not been terminated by\ndischarge or dismissal, but by retrenchment only,\nand that retrenchment not being the result of any\nunfair labour practice or victimization, Respondent\n3 could only claim retrenchment compensation. In\nthe evidence given before the Tribunal, there were\nincluded two letters written by the two\nrespondents      containing    the    demand    for\nretrenchment compensation. We have already\nreferred to one of these letters which was sent on\n7th March, 1958 by Respondent 3 to the\nAdministrative Officer of the appellant. The other\nletter was sent on 10th July, 1958 by the General\nSecretary of Respondent 2 in which again it was\nstated that Sindhu Hotchief had paid retrenchment\ndues to Respondent 3 in respect of the services he\nhad rendered in that Company, but the appellant\nCorporation was responsible for his retrenchment\ndues for the service which had been rendered by\nRespondent 3 in the appellant Corporation. The\nprayer was that, as the appellant had refused him\nre-employment, arrangement should be made to\npay his retrenchment dues according to <a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n25-F</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Thus,\nboth the respondents, in their claims put forward\nbefore the management of the appellant,\nrequested     for    payment     of    retrenchment\ncompensation and did not raise any dispute for\nreinstatement. Since no such dispute about\nreinstatement was raised by either of the\nrespondents before the management of the\nappellant, it is clear that the State Government\nwas not competent to refer a question of\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                 - 20 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                             WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                         C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">reinstatement as an industrial dispute for\nadjudication by the Tribunal. The dispute that the\nState     Government       could    have     referred\ncompetently was the dispute relating to payment\nof retrenchment compensation by the appellant to\nRespondent 3 which had been refused. No doubt,\nthe order of the State Government making the\nreference mentions that the Government had\nconsidered     the   report    submitted    by    the\nConciliation Officer under sub-section (4) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1570927/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 12</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, in\nrespect of the dispute between the appellant and\nworkmen employed under it, over the demand\nmentioned in the Schedule appended to that\norder; and, in the Schedule, the Government\nmentioned that the dispute was that of\nreinstatement of Respondent 3 in the service of\nthe appellant and payment of his wages from 21st\nFebruary,     1958.    It   was    urged    by     Mr\nGopalakrishnan on behalf of the respondents that\nthis   Court     cannot    examine    whether     the\nGovernment, in forming its opinion that an\nindustrial dispute exists, came to its view correctly\nor incorrectly on the material before it. This\nproposition is, no doubt, correct; but the aspect\nthat is being examined is entirely different. It may\nbe that the Conciliation Officer reported to the\nGovernment that an industrial dispute did exist\nrelating to the reinstatement of Respondent 3 and\npayment of wages to him from 21st February,\n1958, but when the dispute came up for\nadjudication before the Tribunal, the evidence\nproduced clearly showed that no such dispute had\never been raised by either respondent with the\nmanagement of the appellant. If no dispute at all\nwas raised by the respondents with the\nmanagement, any request sent by them to the\nGovernment would only be a demand by them and\nnot an industrial dispute between them and their\nemployer. An industrial dispute, as defined, must\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                 - 21 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                             WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                         C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">be a dispute between employers and employers,\nemployers and workmen, and workmen and\nworkmen. A mere demand to a Government,\nwithout a dispute being raised by the workmen\nwith their employer, cannot become an industrial\ndispute. Consequently, the material before the\nTribunal clearly showed that no such industrial\ndispute, as was purported to be referred by the\nState Government to the Tribunal, had ever\nexisted between the appellant Corporation and the\nrespondents and the State Government in making\na reference, obviously committed an error in\nbasing its opinion on material which was not\nrelevant to the formation of opinion. The\nGovernment had to come to an opinion that an\nindustrial dispute did exist and that opinion could\nonly be formed on the basis that there was a\ndispute    between     the   appellant   and    the\nrespondents relating to reinstatement. Such\nmaterial could not possibly exist when, as early as\nMarch and July 1958, Respondent 3 and\nRespondent 2 respectively had confined their\ndemands to the management to retrenchment\ncompensation only and did not make any demand\nfor reinstatement. On these facts, it is clear that\nthe reference made by the Government was not\ncompetent.     The    only   reference   that   the\nGovernment could have made had to be related to\npayment of retrenchment compensation which was\nthe only subject-matter of dispute between the\nappellant and the respondents.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">5. So far as the third ground is concerned, it loses\nforce and does not arise in view of our decision\nrelating to the first ground. We have already held,\nwhen dealing with the first ground, that the\nappellant had neither dismissed Respondent 3, nor\nhad it discharged him from service. There was no\nquestion of wrongful dismissal or discharge by the\nappellant.

He obviously\n        joined the service in Sindhu Hotchief because of\n        the financial advantages that were to accrue to\n        him. In September 1953, he was drawing a salary\n        of Rs 200 p.m. in the scale of Rs 150-10-250 while\n        serving the appellant. The site allowance of 20 per\n        cent, which he had been receiving earlier, had\n        been discontinued from March 1952 and he was\n        not getting it at the time when he went to join\n        Sindhu Hotchief, where he was given a start of Rs\n        240 in the grade of Rs 200-20-400. Consequently,\n        in addition to the immediate rise in salary of Rs 40\n        p.m., he had the advantage of working in the\n        higher grade, in which, within two years, he\n        exceeded the maximum of the scale in which he\n        had been working with the appellant. He served\n        Sindhu Hotchief for a period of about 4½ years\n        and became confirmed there in accordance with\n        the terms and conditions which were offered to\n        him by Sindhu Hotchief. In these circumstances,\n        the respondents cannot urge that the services of\n        Respondent 3 were retrenched by the appellant,\n        either when he went and joined Sindhu Hotchief,\n        or when he wanted to get back to his post with the\n        appellant. His appointment in the service of the\n        appellant having terminated, no question could\n        arise of retrenching him at the stage when he\n        wanted to come back after serving Sindhu\n        Hotchief. His services were, in fact retrenched by\n        his new employer, Sindhu Hotchief, and from that\n        Company he received retrenchment compensation.\n        The    third    ground,   therefore,    needs     no\n        consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">8.18.

Respondent 3\nbefore this Court <a href=\"/doc/1897823/\" id=\"a_17\">in that case</a> was employed by the\nappellant as an accounts clerk at Gandhidham in the\nyear 1950.

The respondent then went to the appellant\nand requested that he might be given posting orders.\nThe appellant declined to do so on the ground that\nthe post which he was occupying in 1953 had been\npermanently filled up.

On June 3, 1966, the Company prayed before the\nIndustrial Tribunal that Issues 1, 3 and 4(set out in\nthe terms of reference) may be decided before the\nparties were called upon to lead their evidence. As\nregards Issues 3 and 4, the contention of the\nmanagement was that the fundamental basis of\nthese two matters was that there was a strike at the\nDelhi Cloth Mills and a sit-down strike at the\nSwatantra Bharat Mills and the only question\nreferred to the Tribunal for decision related to the\nlegality and justification of the said strikes. All the\nfour Unions contended before the Tribunal that there\nwas no strike at the Delhi Cloth Mills. Two of the\nUnions&#x27; case was that the strike at Swatantra Bharat\nMills was in sympathy with the workmen of the Delhi\nCloth Mills; while the other two Unions&#x27; case was that\nthere was a lockout in the Swatantra Bharat Mills. As\nregards the first issue, the case of the Management\nwas that there was a settlement on December 13,\n1965 relating to the computation of bonus for the\nyear 1963-64 between the Company and the two\nmajor Unions. It was stated further that the\nsettlement referred to the computation of bonus in\naccordance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/720619/\" id=\"a_21\">Payment of\nBonus Act, 1965</a> and in arriving at the settlement, all\nthe available and relevant financial statements had\nbeen shown to the Unions which accepted the\naccounts based on allocation of share capital and\nreserves during the years previous to and including\n1963-64. Further, according to the Management, one\nof the Unions had entered into another settlement\nwith the Management of the DCM Silk Mills with\nregard to that Union for the year 1964-65, and in\nview of these settlements, it was not open to the\nworkmen of the Delhi Cloth Mills and Swatantra\nBharat Mills to question the correctness and\nreasonableness of the allocations made by the\nManagement towards share capital and reserves of\nthese two units.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                                     - 28 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                 WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                             C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">         8.22.

There, the petitioner was\nthe owner of a weaving concern at Karur. He had\nput up a thatched shed where he had installed a\ncertain number of handlooms and where towels and\nbed-sheets were manufactured. His office consisted\nof only two clerks, who were the permanent\nmembers of his establishment.

These, they wove into bed-sheets and\ntowels and they were paid at certain rates for the\narticles they wove. These persons came in and went\nout when they liked.

The case\nmentioned above, N. Sundara Money case [(1976) 1\nSCC 822 : 1976 SCC (L&amp;S) 132 : AIR 1976 SC 1111]\nillustrates    the   elements     which      constitute\nretrenchment. The relevant paragraphs read as\nunder : (SCC pp. 826-27, para 9)\n\n&quot;9. A breakdown of <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 2(oo)</a> unmistakably\nexpands       the   semantics     of    retrenchment.\n&#x27;Termination ... for any reason whatsoever&#x27; are the\nkey words. Whatever the reason, every termination\nspells retrenchment. So the sole question is, has the\nemployee&#x27;s service been terminated? Verbal apparel\napart, the substance is decisive. A termination takes\nplace where a term expires either by the active step\nof the master or the running out of the stipulated\nterm. To protect the weak against the strong this\npolicy of comprehensive definition has been\neffectuated. Termination embraces not merely the\nact of termination by the employer, but the fact of\ntermination howsoever produced. May be, the\npresent may be a hard case, but we can visualise\nabuses by employers, by suitable verbal devices,\ncircumventing the armour of <a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 25-F</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 2(oo)</a>. Without speculating on possibilities,\nwe may agree that &#x27;retrenchment&#x27; is no longer terra\nincognita but area covered by an expansive\ndefinition. It means &#x27;to end, conclude, cease&#x27;. In the\npresent case the employment ceased, concluded,\nended on the expiration of one year ten months nine\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">                   - 46 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                               WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                           C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"861688\" id=\"span_126\">days -- automatically may be, but cessation all the\nsame. That to write into the order of appointment\nthe date of termination confers no moksha from\n<a href=\"/doc/1944207/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 25-F(b)</a> is inferable from the proviso to\n<a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 25-F(1)</a> [sic 25-F(a)]. True, the section\nspeaks of retrenchment by the employer and it is\nurged that some act of volition by the employer to\nbring about the termination is essential to attract\n<a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 25-F</a> and automatic extinguishment of\nservice by effluxion of time cannot be sufficient. An\nEnglish case <a href=\"/doc/861688/\" id=\"a_76\">R. v. Secy. of State</a> for Social Services,\nex p Khan [(1973) 1 WLR 187 : (1973) 2 All ER 104\n(CA)] was relied on, where Lord Denning, M.R.\nobserved : (WLR pp. 189-90)\n\n&#x27;... I think that the word &quot;terminate&quot; or &quot;termination&quot;\nis by itself ambiguous. It can refer to either of two\nthings--either to termination by notice or to\ntermination by effluxion of time. It is often used in\nthat dual sense in landlord and tenant and in master\nand servant cases. But there are several indications\nin this paragraph to show that it refers here only to\ntermination by notice.&#x27;\n\nBuckley, L.J., concurred and said : (WLR p. 191)\n\n&#x27;... In my judgment the words are not capable of\nbearing that meaning. As [Counsel for the Secretary\nof State] has pointed out, the verb &quot;terminate&quot; can\nbe used either transitively or intransitively. A\ncontract may be said to terminate when it comes to\nan end by effluxion of time, or it may be said to be\nterminated when it is determined at notice or\notherwise by some act of one of the parties. Here in\nmy judgment the word &quot;terminated&quot; is used in this\npassage in para 190 in the transitive sense and it\npostulates some act by somebody which is to bring\nthe appointment to an end, and is not applicable to a\ncase in which the appointment comes to an end\nmerely by effluxion of time.&#x27;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">                    - 47 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                            C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">Words of multiple import have to be winnowed\njudicially to suit the social philosophy of the statute.\nSo screened, we hold that the transitive and\nintransitive senses are covered in the current\ncontext.     Moreover,     an    employer    terminates\nemployment not merely by passing an order as the\nservice runs. He can do so by writing a composite\norder, one giving employment and the other ending\nor limiting it. A separate, subsequent determination\nis not the sole magnetic pull of the provision. A pre-\nemptive provision to terminate is struck by the same\nvice as the post-appointment termination.

One of the\nimportant factors, which has to be taken into\nconsideration, is the length of service, which the\nworkman had rendered with the employer. If the\nworkman has rendered a considerable period of\nservice and his services are wrongfully terminated,\nhe may be awarded full or partial back wages\nkeeping in view the fact that at his age and the\nqualification possessed by him he may not be in a\nposition to get another employment. However, where\nthe total length of service rendered by a workman is\nvery small, the award of back wages for the\ncomplete period i.e. from the date of termination till\nthe date of the award, which our experience shows is\noften quite large, would be wholly inappropriate.\nAnother important factor, which requires to be taken\ninto consideration is the nature of employment. A\nregular service of permanent character cannot be\ncompared to short or intermittent daily-wage\nemployment though it may be for 240 days in a\ncalendar year.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">32.

This is so because it is settled law that the\nburden of proof of the existence of a particular fact\nlies on the person who makes a positive averment\nabout its existence. It is always easier to prove a\npositive fact than to prove a negative fact.\nTherefore, once the employee shows that he was not\nemployed, the onus lies on the employer to\nspecifically plead and prove that the employee was\ngainfully employed and was getting the same or\nsubstantially similar emoluments.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1059842\" id=\"span_148\">In a number of cases, the superior courts have\ninterfered with the award of the primary adjudicatory\nauthority on the premise that finalisation of litigation\nhas taken long time ignoring that in majority of\ncases the parties are not responsible for such delays.\nLack of infrastructure and manpower is the principal\ncause for delay in the disposal of cases. For this the\nlitigants cannot be blamed or penalised.

Under\nour present Constitution the State is now expressly\ndirected to endeavour to secure to all workers\n(whether agricultural, industrial or otherwise) not\nonly bare physical subsistence but a living wage and\nconditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life\nand full enjoyment of leisure. This directive principle\nof State policy being conducive to the general\ninterest of the nation as a whole, merely lays down\nthe foundation for appropriate social structure in\nwhich the labour will find its place of dignity,\nlegitimately due to it in lieu of its contribution to the\nprogress of national economic prosperity.&#x27;</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">27.

Such control by the employer over the\nemployee is fundamental to the employment\nrelationship. But there are innumerable facets of the\nemployee&#x27;s life that have little or no relevance to the\nemployment relationship and over which the\nemployer should not be allowed to exercise control.\nIt is no doubt difficult to draw a line between\nreasonable demands of an employer and those which\nare unreasonable as having no relation to the\nemployment itself. The rule that an employer can\narbitrarily discharge an employee with or without\nregard to the actuating motive is a rule settled\nbeyond doubt. But the rule became settled at a time\nwhen the words &quot;master&quot; and &quot;servant&quot; were taken\nmore literally than they are now and when, as in\nearly Roman Law, the rights of the servant, like the\nrights of any other member of the household, were\nnot his own, but those of his paterfamilias. The\novertones of this ancient doctrine are discernible in\nthe judicial opinion which rationalised the employer&#x27;s\nabsolute right to discharge the employee. Such a\nphilosophy of the employer&#x27;s dominion over his\nemployee may have been in tune with the rustic\nsimplicity of bygone days. But that philosophy is\nincompatible with these days of large, impersonal,\ncorporate employers. The conditions have now vastly\nchanged and it is difficult to regard the contract of\nemployment       with  large-scale     industries  and\ngovernment enterprises conducted by bodies which\nare created under special statutes as mere contract\nof personal service. Where large number of people\nare unemployed and it is extremely difficult to find\nemployment, an employee who is discharged from\nservice might have to remain without means of\nsubsistence for a considerably long time and\ndamages in the shape of wages for a certain period\nmay not be an adequate compensation to the\nemployee for non-employment. In other words,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">                   - 56 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                               WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                           C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">damages      would be a        poor     substitute for\nreinstatement. The traditional rule has survived\nbecause of the sustenance it received from the law\nof contracts. From the contractual principle of\nmutuality of obligation, it was reasoned that if the\nemployee can quit his job at will, then so too must\nthe employer have the right to terminate the\nrelationship for any or no reason. And there are a\nnumber of cases in which even contracts for\npermanent employment i.e. for indefinite terms,\nhave been held unenforceable on the ground that\nthey lack mutuality of obligation. But these cases\ndemonstrate that mutuality is a high-sounding\nphrase of little use as an analytical tool and it would\nseem clear that mutuality of obligation is not an\ninexorable requirement and that lack of mutuality is\nsimply, as many courts have come to recognise, an\nimperfect way of referring to the real obstacle to\nenforcing any kind of contractual limitation on the\nemployer&#x27;s right of discharge i.e. lack of\nconsideration. If there is anything in contract law\nwhich seems likely to advance the present inquiry, it\nis the growing tendency to protect individuals from\ncontracts of adhesion from overreaching terms often\nfound in standard forms of contract used by large\ncommercial establishments. Judicial disfavour of\ncontracts of adhesion has been said to reflect the\nassumed need to protect the weaker contracting part\nagainst the harshness of the common law and the\nabuses of freedom of contract. The same philosophy\nseems to provide an appropriate answer to the\nargument, which still seems to have some vitality,\nthat the servant cannot complain, as he takes the\nemployment on the terms which are offered to him.&#x27;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">28. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1776682\" id=\"span_161\">In <a href=\"/doc/1776682/\" id=\"a_103\">Govt.

In the present matter, the employer claims that\n\n      the   workers    were      engaged       by   and    were\n\n      employees   of   the       contractor,    whereas     the\n\n      workers claim that though they were employees\n\n      of the contractor, they were under the day-to-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">      day   supervision      and     instructions     of    the\n\n      employer and as such, the contractor was not\n\n      their employer.

What is not in dispute is that the workmen were\n\n      engaged by the contractor, in furtherance of\n\n      which the workmen were discharging their\n\n      duties at the factory of the employer. The only\n\n      question is whether the workmen were directly\n\n      working   with   the       employer   or   for   the\n\n      contractor?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">13.5. The evidence on record which has been dealt\n\n      with by the labour Court categorically indicates\n\n      that the instructions were being issued by the\n\n      employer, the targets were set by the employer\n\n      and it is only the supply of labour which was\n\n      made by the contractor to the employer. The\n\n      aspect of determining whether the workmen\n\n      were employees of the employer or that of the\n\n      contractor would therefore require examination\n\n      of the contract between the employer and the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">                       - 65 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                                   WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                               C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"128510036\" id=\"span_181\">contractor in order to come to a decision on the\n\nabove point. Thus, unless the contract is one\n\nwhich    cannot       be       said   to    be        sham    or\n\ncamouflage, the workmen would continue to be\n\nthose engaged by the contractor and not by the\n\nemployer. However, if the contract is said to be\n\nsham and camouflage a conclusion could be\n\narrived at that the workmen were employees of\n\nthe employer. Thus this aspect of whether the\n\ncontract was sham and camouflage is in my\n\nconsidered opinion an integral part of the\n\nquestion to determine whether the aggrieved\n\nworkmen were the direct employees of the\n\nemployer or the contractor. Thus, the decision\n\nrelied   upon        by    Sri.K.R.Anand         in    <a href=\"/doc/128510036/\" id=\"a_112\">Sindhu\n\nResettlement Corpn.

Similarly, the decisions in Jaipur Udyog Ltd.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_141\">      (supra7), Delhi Cloth &amp; General Mills Co.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">      Ltd.

The decision in Oshiar Prasad&#x27;s\n\n      case (supra1) relied upon by Sri.K.R.Anand that\n\n      a labour contract having been terminated, the\n\n      workmen could not seek for regularization\n\n      would also not be applicable since the very\n\n      termination of the contract appears to be for\n\n      the purpose of getting rid of the contract labour\n\n      who have been working in perennial jobs for a\n\n      long time with the employer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                       - 67 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                   WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">                               C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">13.7. The decision in Mahendra Prasad Jakhmola&#x27;s\n\n     case (supra2) relied upon by the learned\n\n     counsel to contend that mere supervision would\n\n     not make a contract worker, a worker of the\n\n     employer is not applicable for the reason that in\n\n     the present case, it is not just supervision, but\n\n     also allotment of work fixing of targets for each\n\n     of the contract workmen was made by the\n\n     employer. Whether the salary is paid directly by\n\n     the principal employer to the workmen or\n\n     through contractor, in my considered opinion,\n\n     would not make much of a difference if the\n\n     engagement of the workmen is made through a\n\n     contractor as a camouflage. It is only when a\n\n     contractor has been hired who in turn deputes\n\n     workmen for a specific period of time to\n\n     conduct non-perennial work, that the decision\n\n     in Bharatlals&#x27; case (supra4) relied upon by\n\n     Sri.K.R.Anand would be applicable and not in a\n\n     situation   where    a    workmen    having   been\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">                        - 68 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                                    WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                                C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">      engaged for a long period of time though a\n\n      contractor to provide services for the employer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">13.8. The last contention of Sri.K.R.Anand in this\n\n      regard is that so long as the contract labour is\n\n      permitted and there is no embargo under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 10</a> of the CLRA, any employer can\n\n      make use of contract labour and that labour\n\n      cannot seek for regularization is also in my\n\n      considered opinion not a proposition to be\n\n      applied to the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">13.9. The   engagement      of    contract   labour   being\n\n      permitted merely on account of no prohibition\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 10</a> of CLRA being made would\n\n      not entitle an employer to use the said process\n\n      for its own benefit in reducing its burden and or\n\n      depriving the workmen of their just wages. In\n\n      the event of a notification under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 10</a>\n\n      being issued, it is very clear that no contract\n\n      labour could be used. If any workmen are\n\n      engaged through a contractor then they would\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">                         - 69 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                                     WP No. 31261 of 2016</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                 C/W WP No. 57652 of 2017</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">      get the preference for being considered for\n\n      appointment as and when there is a vacancy\n\n      which   arises.   Even      otherwise,   though   no\n\n      notification under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 10</a> is issued if the\n\n      employer were to terminate a contract with a\n\n      contractor and the employer were to engage\n\n      new labour, it would be the duty of the\n\n      employer to provide employment to those\n\n      workmen as and when vacancy arises, as also\n\n      for the employer not to engage any other\n\n      workmen other than the contract workers for\n\n      the said post without offering the same to the\n\n      contract workers. Thus, whether a notification\n\n      is issued under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 10</a> of CLRA or not, the\n\n      right of the workmen to raise industrial dispute\n\n      of they being denied work would still continue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">13.10.
