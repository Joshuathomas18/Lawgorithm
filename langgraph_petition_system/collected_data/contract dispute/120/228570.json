The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nVENKATARAMA  AIYAR,  J.-These are appeals by  special  leave\nagainst\t judgments of High Court of Calcutta  setting  aside\nawards which directed the respondents to pay compensation to\nthe  appellants for Breach of contracts, on the ground\tthat\nthey were in contravention of a notification of the  Central\nGovernment dated October 29, 1.953, and were in\t consequence\nillegal and void.  These appeals were heard along with Civil\nAppeals Nos. 98 &amp; 99 of 1960 as there were common  questions\nof law to be decided in all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">In  Civil Appeals Nos. 389 &amp; 390 of 1960 the facts are\tthat\non  September  7,  1955, the appellants who  are  a  company\nowning\ta  Jute Mill at Calcutta entered into  an  agreement\nwith  the respondents who are also a Company doing  business\nas  dealers in jute, for the purchase of 2,250 bales of\t the\njute\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">212</span>\ncuttings at Rs. 80 per bale of 400 lbs. to be delivered\t 750\nbales  every month in October, November and December,  1955.\nClause\t14  of\tthe agreement  provides\t that  all  disputes\narising out of or concerning the contract should be referred\nto  the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.\t The\nrespondents delivered, pursuant to the contract, in all 2000\nbales and made default in the delivery of the balance.\t The\nappellants  then applied to the Bengal Chamber\tof  Commerce\nfor arbitration in accordance with cl. 14 of the  agreement.\nThe   respondents  appeared  before  the   arbitrators\t and\ncontested the claims on the merits.  The arbitrators made an\naward  in favour of the appellants for Rs. 10,525, and\tthat\nwas  filed under<a href=\"/doc/789187/\" id=\"a_8\"> s. 14(2)</a> of the Indian arbitration  Act  in\nthe  High Court of Calcutta on its original side and  notice\nwas  issued  to the respondents.  Thereupon  they  filed  an\napplication  presumably under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_9\"> s. 33</a> of the  Arbitration\t Act\nfor a declaration that the contract dated September 7, 1955,\nwas  illegal as it was in contravention of the\tnotification\nof  the Central Government dated October 29, 1953, and\tthat\nthe award based thereon was a nullity.\tThe learned Judge on\nthe  original side before whom the application came  up\t for\nhearing\t dismissed it, and passed a decree in terms  of\t the\naward.\t Against  both\tthe  judgment  and  the\t order,\t the\nrespondents  preferred\tappeals to a Division Bench  of\t the\nHigh Court, appeals Nos. 148 &amp; 141 of 1957.  They were heard\nby  Chakravartti, C. J., and Lahiri, J., who held  that\t the\ncontract  dated September 7, 1955, was illegal, as  it\tfell\nwithin\tthe prohibition contained in a notification  of\t the\nCentral\t Government dated October 29, 1953, and\t accordingly\nallowed the appeals and set aside the award.  The appellants\nthen  applied  for a certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1887845/\" id=\"a_10\">Art.  133(3)</a>  of\t the\nConstitution  but  the same was\t refused.

This  is\nhow these appeals come before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">In  Civil  Appeals Nos. 391 and 392 of 1960  the  facts\t are\nsimilar.   The\tappellants  who are a  company\tcarrying  on\nbusiness in the manufacture of jute entered into a  contract\nwith  the respondents on October 17, 1955, for the  purchase\nof 500 bales of into cuttings at Rs. 87-8-0 per bale of\t 400\nlbs.,  to be delivered in equal instalment of 250  bales  in\nNovember  and in December 1955.\t Clause 14 of the  agreement\nprovides  that all differences arising out of or  concerning\nthe  contract  should be referred to the Bengal\t Chamber  of\nCommerce for arbitration. The respondent made default in the\ndelivery  of the, goods and thereupon the  appellants  moved\nthe Chamber of Commerce for arbitration under cl. 14 of\t the\nagreement.  The respondents appeared before the\t arbitrators\nand contested the claim on the merits.\tThe arbitrators made\nan  award in favour of the appellants for Rs.  17,500,\tand\nthat was filed in the High Court of Calcutta on it  original\nside  and notice under<a href=\"/doc/76709/\" id=\"a_12\"> s. 14(2)</a> of the Arbitration  Act\t was\nserved\t on  the  respondents.\t Thereupon  they  filed\t  an\napplication in the High Court of Calcutta, presumably  under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_13\">\ns. 33</a> of the Arbitration Act for a declaration that the con-\ntract  dated October 17, 1955, was in contravention  of\t the\nnotification  of  the Central Government dated\tOctober\t 29,\n1953,  and  was therefore illegal and that  the\t arbitration\nproceedings  pursuant thereto and the award  passed  therein\nwere  all  void.  The learned single Judge on  the  original\nside  before whom the application came up for  hearing\tdis-\nmissed\tit  and\t passed\t a decree in  terms  of\t the  award.\nAgainst\t the  above  judgment  and  order  the\t respondents\npreferred  appeals  to a Division Bench of the\tHigh  Court,\nAppeals Nos. 142 and 143 of They were heard by\tChakravarti,\nC.J., and Lahiri, J.,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">214</span>\nwho  hold  that\t the contract dated October  17,  1955,\t was\nillegal, as it fell within the prohibition contained in\t the\nnotification  of  the Central Government dated\tOctober\t 29,\n1953, and accordingly allowed the appeals and set aside\t the\nawards.\t   The\tappellant  thereafter  applied\tunder\t<a href=\"/doc/1011888/\" id=\"a_14\">Art.\n133(1)(c)</a>  for\ta certificate and that having  been  refused\nthey  obtained from this Court leave under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 136</a>  of\t the\nConstitution  and that is how these appeals come before\t us.\nThe  points for decision in all these appeals are  the\tsame\nand this Judgment will govern all of them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">The  following\tcontentions have been urged  in\t support  of\nthese appeals:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t      (1)  <a href=\"/doc/1771012/\" id=\"a_16\">The Forward Contracts  (Regulation)\tAct,\n\t\t\t    1952</a>, is ultra vires and the notification date\nd\n\t      October  29, 1953, is in consequence Bull\t and\n\t      void.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t      (2)On the terms of the arbitration clause\t the\n\t      question whether the contracts dated September\n\t      7, 1955, and October 17, 1955, are illegal  is\n\t      one for the     arbitrators to decide and that\n\t      it  was not open to respondents to  raise\t the\n\t      same  in\tapplications  under  s.\t 33  of\t the\n\t      <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_17\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      (3)   The\t  respondents\tsubmitted   to\t the\n\t      jurisdiction  of\tthe  arbitrators  and\tthat\n\t      amounts to fresh agreement for arbitration and\n\t      the award is accordingly valid and binding  on\n\t      them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t      (4) The contracts dated September 7, 1955, and\n\t      October,\t 17,   1955   are   non-transferable\n\t      specific\tdelivery contracts and they are\t not\n\t      hit  by  the notification\t dated\tOctober\t 29,\n\t      1953,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> 215</span>\n(1)The\tfirst  question\t relates to  the  vires\t of  <a href=\"/doc/1771012/\" id=\"a_18\">Forward\nContracts   (Regulation)  Act,\t1952</a>  (Act  74\t of   1952),\nhereinafter  referred  to  as the Act&#x27;.\t  This\tstatute\t was\nenacted\t by  Parliament\t and  received\tthe  assent  of\t the\nPresident on December 26, 1952.\t Its validity is attacked on\ntwo grounds;

falling under entry 48 in List I and\tthat\nit is Parliament which has the exclusive competence over it,\nand  in the alternative it is one on contracts, and that  is\ncovered\t by entry 7 in List III in the Seventh Schedule\t and\nis intra vires.\t To decide this question, it is necessary to\nascertain the true nature and scope of the legislation,\t its\npith and substance.  The object of the Act as stated in\t the\npreamble  is  &quot;to  provide for\tthe  regulation\t of  certain\nmatters\t relating to forward contracts, the  prohibition  of\noptions\t in goods and for the matters connected\t therewith&quot;.\nThe  statute  make,; a distinction between  &quot;ready  delivery\ncontracts&quot; and &quot;forward contracts.&quot; When a contract provides\nfor  the  delivery of goods and payment\t of  price  therefor\neither\timmediately or within a period not exceeding  eleven\ndays  it is a ready delivery contract.\tAll other  contracts\nare forward contracts.\tForward contracts are again  divided\ninto two categories &#x27;specific delivery contracts&#x27; and  &#x27;non-\ntransferable   specific\t  delivery   contracts&#x27;,   &#x27;Specific\ndelivery contracts&#x27; mean forward contracts which provide for\nactual delivery of specific goods at the price fixed  during\nspecified future , period.  &#x27;Non-transferable specific deli-\nvery  contracts&#x27; are specific delivery contracts the  rights\nor liabilities under which are not transferable.  <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 15</a>\nconfers\t power\ton  the Government  to\tissue  notifications\ndeclaring  illegal forward contracts with reference to\tsuch\ngoods  or  class  of  goods and in  such  areas\t as  may  be\nspecified.  <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 17</a> authorises the Government to prohibit\nby  notification  any  forward\tcontract  for  the  sale  or\npurchase  of  any  goods  or class of  goods  to  which\t the\nprovisions  of<a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_24\"> s.15</a> have not been made applicable.   <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n18</a> exempts non-transferable specific delivery contracts from\nthe operation of these\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">217</span>\nsections.   Thus  the law is what it purports to be,  a\t law\nregulating Forward Contracts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"901302\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1595107\" id=\"span_8\">That  being  the scope of the enactment, the  point  debated\nbefore\tus is whether it is a law on Trade and\tCommerce  or\nProduction, supply and&#x27; distribution of goods within entries\n26 or 27 in List II or on Futures Markets within entry 48 in\nList I. ,It would be noticed that both the entries 26 and 27\nin List II are subject to entry 33 in List Ill.\t Entry 33 as\nit   now  stands  is:  &quot;Trade  and  commerce  in,  and\t the\nProduction, supply distribution of...... (e) raw jute&quot;.\t The\nimpugned Act in so far as it relates to raw jute-and that is\nwhat we are concerned with, in these appeals-will clearly be\nintra  vires if it fell under this entry.  But it should  be\nmentioned  that\t el.

In\nthat  context, discussing the meaning of the  word  market&#x27;,\nthe Court observed that it meant &quot;a place set apart for\t the\nmeeting of the general public of buyers and sellers,  freely\nopen to any such to assemble together, where any seller\t may\nexpose\this goods for sale and any buyer may purchase&quot;.</span>\t  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"901302\" id=\"span_11\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/901302/\" id=\"a_30\">Commissioner, Coimbatore Municipality v.

The Court held that  the  ordinary\nmeaning of market was place where the public could go during\nparticular times for purpose of buying and selling and\tthat\non  the\t facts\tthe place in question  was  market.   It  is\ncontended  on the strength of the above rulings that as\t the\nimpugned  Act  is not one with reference to  building  where\nbusiness is being transacted it is not a law with  reference\nto markets.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">We  are\t unable to agree with this  contention.\t  Market  no\ndoubt  ordinarily  means  a place where\t business  is  being\ntransacted.   That was probably all that it meant at a\ttime\nwhen  trade  was not developed and  when  transactions\ttook\nplace at specified places.  But with the development of com-\nmerce,\tbargains  came to be concluded more often  than\t not\nthrough\t correspondence\t and  the connotation  of  the\tword\n&#x27;market&#x27;  underwent  a corresponding expansion.\t  In  modern\nparlance the word &#x27;market&#x27; has come to mean business as well\nas  the place where business is carried on.

Thus in <a href=\"/doc/1595107/\" id=\"a_31\">Public Prosecutor v. Cheru Kutti</a>\t (<a href=\"/doc/901302/\" id=\"a_32\">1)\nand   Commissioner,  Coimbator\tMunicipality  v.

So we must examine what the\tword  market\nmeans  &#x27;in  entry 48 ,Futures Markets&quot; in List I.  The\tword\n&#x27;Futures&#x27;  is  thus  defined  in  Encyclopaedia\t  Britannioa\n&quot;contracts  which consist of a promise to deliver  specified\nqualities of some commodity at a specified future time.\t The\nobligation  is for a single quantity in a given\t month......\nFutures are thus a form of security, analogous to a bond  or\npromissory note&quot;.  In this sense a market can have reference\nonly to business and not to any location.  In our opinion  a\nlegislation  on Forward Contracts would be a legislation  on\nFutures Markets.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"582733\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1183314\" id=\"span_16\">It  is next argued for the appellants that even if a law  on\nForward\t Contracts  can\t be said to be a  law  on.   Futures\nMarkets,  it  must be held to be legislation  falling  under\nentry  26  in List IT, and not entry 48 in list\t 1,  because\nForward\t Contracts form a major sector of modern trade,\t and\nconstitute its very core, and to exclude them from the ambit\nof  entry 26 in List II, would be to rob it of much  of\t its\ncontents.    Reliance\twas  placed  in\t support   of\tthis\ncontention, on the rule of construction that the entries  in\nthe Lists should be construed liberally and on the  decision\nin  <a href=\"/doc/1183314/\" id=\"a_33\">Bhuwalka Brothers Ltd. v.

But there is no need  for\t the\nappellants to call this rule in aid of their contention,  as\ntrade  and  commerce would, in their ordinary  and  accepted\nsense.\tinclude forward contracts, That was the\t view  which\nwas  adopted  in <a href=\"/doc/1183314/\" id=\"a_35\">Bhuwalka Brothers Ltd.</a>\t case(1)  and  which\ncommended itself to this Court in Duni Chand Rateria&#x27;s\tcase\n(2).   Therefore, if the question were simply whether a\t law\non  Forward Contracts would be a law with respect  to  Trade\nand commerce, there should be no difficulty in answering  it\nin  the\t affirmative,  But the point which we  have  got  to\ndecide is as to the scope of the entry &#x27;Trade and  commerce&#x27;\nread  in juxtaposition with entry 48 of List I. As  the\t two\nentries\t relate\t to  the powers mutually  exclusive  of\t two\ndifferent legislatures, the question is how these two are to\nbe  reconciled.\t  Now it is a rule of construction  as\twell\nestablished  as that on which the appellants rely, that\t the\nentries\t in  the  Lists should be so construed\tas  to\tgive\neffect\tto  all of them and that a construction\t which\twill\nresult\tin any of them being rendered futile or otiose\tmust\n,be avoided.  It follows from this that where there are\t two\nentries,  one  general\tin  its\t character  and\t the   other\nspecific,  the\tformer must be construed  as  excluding\t the\nlatter.\t  This is only an application of the  general  maxim\nthat Generalia specialibus non derogant.  It is obvious that\nif  entry  26 is to be construed  as  comprehending  Forward\nContracts,  then  &quot;Futures  Markets&quot; in\t entry\t48  will  be\nrendered useless.  We are therefore of opinion that legisla-\ntion  on Forward Contracts must be held to fall\t within\t the\nexclusive competence of the Union under entry 48 in List I.\nIt  now\t remains  to deal with the decisions  on  which\t the\nappellants  rely  in support of their  contention  that\t the\nlegislation is really one on Trade\n(1) A.I.R. 1952 Cal. 740.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1071\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> 221</span>\nand commerce falling within entry 26.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1183314\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/1183314/\" id=\"a_36\">Bhuwalka  Brothers\nLtd.</a>  case  (1)\t the question was  with\t reference&#x27;  to\t the\nvalidity  of the West Bengal Jute Goods\t Futures  Ordinance,\n1949.\tThat Ordinance had been promulgated by the  Governor\nwithout\t obtaining the consent of the  Governor-General\t and\nthe contention was that the legislation fell within entry  7\n&#x27;Contracts&#x27; in List III and as the consent of the  Governor-\nGeneral\t had not been obtained it was invalid.\t As  against\nthis it was contended that the legislation was with  respect\nto  Trade  and commerce which fell within List II  and\tthat\ntherefore  the\tconsent\t of  the  Governor-General  was\t not\nnecessary.

Subsequent thereto the parties  entered\tinto\nseveral contracts and then a dispute arose with reference to\none  of them.  One of the parties denied the  contracts\t and\nthe question was whether an award passed by the\t arbitrators\nwith reference to that dispute was without jurisdiction.  In\nholding that the arbitrators had jurisdiction to decide\t the\nmatter by virtue of the agreement antecedent to the disputed\none, the Court observed : &quot;Now, the principle of the  matter\nis this that when a party denies the arbitration  agreement,\nthe  very  basis  on  which  the  arbitrator  can  acts\t  is\nchallenged and therefore the Courts have taken the view that\nin such a case the arbitrator has no jurisdiction to  decide\nwhether\t he himself has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon\t the\ndispute........................ If the arbitration agreement\nis  part and parcel of the contract itself, by\tdenying\t the\nfactum\tof the contract the party is denying the  submission\nclause and denying the jurisdiction of the arbitrators.\t But\nin  this  case\tthe  position  is  different.\tWe  have  an\nindependent  agreement by which the parties agreed to  refer\nthe  disputes to arbitration.

It is not contended for  the  appellants\nthat there was any express agreement between the parties for\nreferring the disputes under the contract dated September 7,\n1955,  to  arbitrators.\t  All  that  is\t said  is  that\t the\nrespondent  filed statements before the arbitrators  setting\nout their defence on the merits, and that must be  construed\nas  an\tindependent  agreement\tfor  arbitration.  and\t the\ndecisions in <a href=\"/doc/1133827/\" id=\"a_54\">National Fire and General Insurance Co.

In both  these\ncases there was a valid submission on which the\t arbitrators\nproceeded to act.  Before them the parties filed  statements\nand therein they put forward a claim which was not  actually\ncovered\t by  the reference, and invited them to\t give  their\ndecision thereon.  The party against whom the award had gone\ncontended   that   the\t arbitrators   had   acted   without\njurisdiction  in  deciding that claim.\tIn  overruling\tthis\ncontention the Court held that it was open to the  parties\nto enlarge the scope of a reference by inclusion of a  fresh\ndispute. that they must be held to have done that when\tthey\nfiled their statements putting forward claims not covered by\nthe original agreement, that these statements satisfied\t the\nrequirements of<a href=\"/doc/1430346/\" id=\"a_58\"> s. 2(a)</a> of the Arbitration Act, and that  it\nwas\n(1) A I.R. 1956 Col.</span> II.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">(2) [1959] 64 C.W.N. 616.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">228</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1986314\" id=\"span_39\">competent  to  the arbitrators to decide the  dispute.\t The\npoint to be noticed is that in both these cases there was no\nwant  of  initial jurisdiction, but a  feeding\tof  existing\njurisdiction by an enlargement of the scope of the reference\nThat  this does not involve any question of jurisdiction  of\nthe  arbitrators will be clear from the scheme of  the\tAct.\nIf an award deals with a matter not covered by the agreement\nit could either be modified under<a href=\"/doc/971137/\" id=\"a_59\"> s. 15(a)</a> or remitted under<a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_60\">\ns.  16(1)(a)</a>..\tAnd where such matter is dealt with  on\t the\ninvitation of the parties contained in the statements, there\ncan be no difficulty in holding that the arbitrators  actual\nwithin\tjurisdiction.
