While referring to\n\nthe General Conditions of the Contract and <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_2\">section 11</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996, a request was made to appoint an\n\nArbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">7.   The applicant&#x27;s such notice was responded to by the\n\nrespondent No.3 vide letter dated 28.05.2018.                  In the letter\n\naforesaid, the respondent Railways highlighted the defects and\n\ndeficiencies in the work performed by the applicant. It was further\n\nindicated that the request for arbitration is to be decided by the\n\nZonal Headquarters with the suggestion to the applicant to contact\n\nNorth Western Railways Headquarters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">8.   Instant application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_3\">section 11</a> of the Act of 1996 has\n\nbeen preferred stating that the applicant is not agreeable to the\n\nappointment of the Arbitrator as per the Standard General\n\nConditions of the Contract and thus, a prayer has been made to\n\nappoint an independent Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">9.   A reply to the application had been filed on 27.02.2019\n\nstating that the applicant has failed to follow the prescribed\n\nprocedure for appointment of Arbitrator. Thereafter, an additional\n\nreply came to be filed by the Railways on 02.09.2019 highlighting\n\nthat the dispute sought to be adjudicated by the applicant by way\n\nof arbitration is not arbitrable.        It has been contended by the\n\nrespondents that the contract in question has been determined in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                   (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:51 PM)</span>\n                                         (4 of 21)               [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\nterms of clause 62 of the Standard General Conditions of the\n\nContract, which contingency has been specifically kept out of the\n\npurview of the arbitration as per clause 63 of the General\n\nConditions of the Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">10.   Mr. Gautam, learned counsel for the applicant submitted that\n\nas a consequence of pre-mature termination of the contract, the\n\napplicant has been put to grave financial loss, which needs to be\n\nadjudicated by dispute resolution mechanism as stipulated in\n\nclause 64 of the Standard General Conditions of the Contract.\n\nWhile pointing out that clause 64.(1) incorporates an arbitration\n\nclause, he implored that an independent arbitrator be appointed\n\nand the matter be referred to a sole arbitrator for resolution of the\n\ndispute between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">11.   Learned counsel eagerly yet courtly, stated that after\n\ninsertion of sub-section (6<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_4\">A) in the Act</a> of 1996 by Act No.3 of\n\n2016 w.e.f. 23.10.2015, the Court is simply required to see the\n\nexistence of arbitration clause and appoint an arbitrator.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">12.   While inviting Court&#x27;s attention towards the notice dated\n\n31.01.2018 and the order of determination of the contract dated\n\n12.02.2018 more particularly the reasons thereof, Mr. Deepak\n\nVyas, learned counsel appearing for the respondents-Railway\n\nsubmitted that the dispute in question is not amenable to\n\narbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">13.   While underscoring that the order dated 12.02.2018 bringing\n\nan end to the contractual relationship was in terms of clause 62 of\n\nthe Standard General Conditions of the Contract, learned counsel\n\ntook the Court through clause 63 of the Standard General\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                    (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:51 PM)</span>\n                                         (5 of 21)                [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\nConditions of the Contract and urged that the matters in which the\n\ndecision has been taken in exercise of power under clause 62.(1)\n\nto 62.(1)(xiii)(B) of the Standard General Conditions of the\n\nContract, fall within &quot;excepted matters&quot;.                 He added that such\n\nmatters not arbitrable and, the decisions of the Railway are final.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">14.   His argument in other words was that, since the contract has\n\nbeen rescinded in terms of clause 62.(1)(vii) of the Standard\n\nGeneral Conditions of the Contract, the same falls in &quot;excepted\n\nmatters&quot; and thus is outside the purview of arbitration.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">15.   It was vehemently argued that mere presence of arbitration\n\nclause in a contract does not make all the disputes arbitrable,\n\nparticularly when the nature of dispute has been kept out of the\n\nscope of the arbitration. He argued that the applicant has simply\n\nreferred to clause 64 of the Conditions of Contract, whereas the\n\nsaid clause is required to be read with the other relevant clauses,\n\nparticularly clause 63.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">16.   Mr. Gautam, learned counsel for the applicant submitted in\n\nthe rejoinder that the question as to whether a dispute is\n\narbitrable or not is required to be decided by the arbitrator, once\n\nreference is made and the Court while deciding an application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_5\">section 11</a> of the Act need not go into the question as to\n\nwhether the dispute is arbitrable or not.                He added that all the\n\nquestions including the one being canvassed by Mr. Vyas can be\n\nraised before and decided by the Arbitration Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_6\">section\n\n16</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">17.   Expanding the above argument further, he added that after\n\ninsertion of sub-section (6A) in <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_7\">section 11</a> of the Act of 1996, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                    (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:51 PM)</span>\n                                        (6 of 21)               [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\nscope of designate of the Chief Justice has been minimized. The\n\nCourt is now supposed to ascertain the existence of arbitration\n\nclause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">18.

[2019SCC Online\n\nDel 6964], particularly para 107 and 108 are relevant and worthy\n\nof reproduction, which I hereby do :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                    (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:52 PM)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">                                                 (16 of 21)                  [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\n      &quot;107.     In my view, the scope of examination as to\n      whether or not the claims lodged are Notified Claims\n      has     narrowed     down       considerably            in   view     of     the\n      language of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 11</a>(6-A) of the 1996 Act.                           To my\n      mind,     once     the   Court       is     persuaded          that    it    has\n      jurisdiction to entertain a <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 11</a> petition all that is\n      required to examine is as to whether or not an\n      arbitration agreement exists between the parties which\n      is relatable to the dispute at hand. The latter part of\n      the     exercise    adverted         to     above,       which        involves\n      correlating the dispute with the arbitration agreement\n      obtaining between the parties, is an aspect which is\n      implicitly embedded in sub-section (6-A) of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 11</a>\n      of the 1996 Act, which, otherwise, requires the Court to\n      confine its examination only to the existence of the\n      arbitration agreement. Therefore, if on a bare perusal\n      of the agreement it is found that a particular dispute is\n      not   relatable     to   the     arbitration           agreement,           then,\n      perhaps, the Court may decline the relief sought for by\n      a party in a <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 11</a> petition. However, if there is a\n      contestation with regard to the issue as to whether the\n      dispute    falls   within      the     realm       of    the     arbitration\n      agreement, then, the best course would be to allow the\n      arbitrator to form a view in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">      108. Thus, unless it is in a manner of speech, a chalk\n      and cheese situation or a black and white situation\n      without shades of grey, the court concerned hearing\n      <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 11</a> petition should follow the more conservative\n      course of allowing parties to have their say before the\n      Arbitral Tribunal.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">39.    In view of the aforesaid, the question, which has cropped up\n\nfor consideration of this court is, as to whether in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, it is manifestly and ex-facie clear that\n\nthe arbitration agreement is non-existent, invalid or the dispute is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                         (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:52 PM)</span>\n                                         (17 of 21)              [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\nnon-arbitrable, so that the application in hands can be rejected, as\n\nhas been held by their Lordships in Vidya Drolia&#x27;s case (supra).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">40.   In the opinion of this Court, mere bodily or physical\n\nexistence of a clause in the contract providing a remedy of\n\narbitration completely divorced of a nexus or relatability with the\n\ndispute is like an uprooted tree having lost connection with the\n\nsoil; ...... at the first flush it may appear to be a tree but it actually\n\nis a log - A stem not having its roots connected to the ground to\n\ndraw water and nutrients; It is just a deadwood. In order to be a\n\nvalid; existing and alive arbitration clause, it is quintessential that\n\nthe same is applicable to the issue(s), on which the contracting\n\nparties have locked horns.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">41.   In other words, in short, it can be said that after insertion of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_57\">section 11(6A)</a> in the Act of 1996 and in light of the verdict of the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Vidya Drolia&#x27;s case (supra),\n\npursuant to an application under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act,\n\nappointment of an arbitrator is a rule.              The only exceptions are,\n\nwhen the arbitration agreement is manifestly non-existent/invalid\n\nor the dispute(s) is/are ex-facie non arbitrable.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">42.   Coming back to the facts of the present case, indisputably,\n\nthe Railways had issued a notice dated 31.01.2018 to the\n\napplicant inter-alia giving him 48 hours&#x27; time in terms of clause 62\n\nof the Standard General Conditions of the Contract.               Similarly, a\n\nnotice under clause 62 was also issued by the Railways on\n\n17.07.2017. It will not be out of context to reproduce the notice\n\ndated 31.01.2018, which preceded the determination/termination\n\nof the subject contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                    (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:52 PM)</span>\n</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">                     (18 of 21)              [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">(Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:52 PM)</span>\n                                         (19 of 21)              [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">43.   It is, therefore, apparent that the applicant&#x27;s contract was\n\nannulled or rescinded in terms of clause 62 of the Standard\n\nGeneral Conditions of the Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">44.   A bare look at the relevant clause 63, which has been given\n\nunder the heading &quot;Settlement of Disputes - Indian Railway\n\nArbitration Rules&quot; shows that all disputes and differences, whether\n\nduring the progress of the work or after its completion or after\n\ndetermination of the contract are required to be intimated by the\n\nContractor to the General Manager, who within 120 days of the\n\nreceipt of the representation is supposed to notify all matters,\n\nsubject of course to the exception that has been carved out in\n\nclause 63 to the effect that the matters in which action/decision\n\nhas been made in clauses 8, 18, 22(5), 39, 43(2), 45(a), 55, 55-\n\nA(5), 57, 57A, 61(1), 61(2) and 62(1) to (xiii)(B) of the Standard\n\nGeneral Conditions of the Contract would be deemed as &#x27;excepted\n\nmatters&#x27; (matters not arbitrable) and decisions of the Railway\n\nauthorities thereon will be final and binding.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">45.   Clause 63 has further been cemented by use of the\n\nexpression &quot;provided further that &#x27;excepted matters&#x27; shall stand\n\nspecifically excluded from the purview of the Arbitration clause.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">46.   A further look at clause 64.(1) of the Standard General\n\nConditions shows that apart from the &#x27;excepted matters&#x27; referred\n\nto in clause 63 of the Conditions, all disputes are liable to be\n\nreferred to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">47.   True it is, that an arbitration clause does exist in the form of\n\nclause 63 and 64 of the Standard Terms and Conditions of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                    (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:52 PM)</span>\n                                         (20 of 21)              [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\nContract.     But mere existence of an arbitration clause in the\n\ncontract or in the Standard General Conditions of the Contract\n\ndoes not lead to existence of an arbitration clause.              Bouquet of\n\nconditions in the Standard General Conditions are required to be\n\nread as a whole. A simple look at clause 63 shows that certain\n\nclauses of the general conditions have been kept out of the\n\nprecincts of the dispute resolution mechanism by the arbitrator\n\nand clause 62 is one of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">48.   No rocket-science, forensic skill or even scrutiny of host of\n\ndocuments is required to decide this fundamental question in the\n\ninstant case. A simple look at the notice dated 31.01.2018; the\n\norder dated 12.02.2018, rescinding the contract and a conjoint\n\nreading of clause 62/63 of the agreement is enough to enable a\n\nperson to conclude or hold that the dispute in question is not\n\narbitrable and that the determination of the contract in applicant&#x27;s\n\ncase falls within the &#x27;excepted matters&#x27; or the matters not\n\narbitrable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">49.   In the extant factual matrix, since the contract had been\n\nrescinded while invoking clause 62.(1)(vii) of the General Terms\n\nand Conditions, the arbitration clause namely clause 63 has been\n\nrendered innately and intrinsically redundant - like a vestigial\n\norgan in the human body - which exists but is non-functional ... ...\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">50.   As an upshot of the discussion aforesaid, this Court is of the\n\nconsidered view that the applicant does not even have an\n\narguable case about existence of arbitration clause - it is a clear\n\ncase of non-existence of an arbitration clause and the dispute\n\nbeing non-arbitrable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                    (Downloaded on 09/09/2021 at 08:40:52 PM)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">                                                                            (21 of 21)              [ARBAP-15/2018]\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">                                   51.
