The writ petition was directed to be placed \nbefore the Division Bench by a learned Single Judge.  But the \nquestion referred by learned Single Judge i.e. question of \nlimitation was left open to be adjudicated by the appropriate \nauthority in accordance with law.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">The background facts in a nutshell are as follows :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">The respondent No.1 had entered into Ext. P1 agreement \nwith the appellant-Kerala State Science and Technology, \nThiruvananthapuram which is a society registered under the \nTravancore Cochin Literary and Scientific Societies \nRegistration Act, 1995, on 16.05.1988 for the construction of \nplanetarium building of the Kerala State Science and \nTechnology Museum and allied Civil Works. Dispute having \narisen between the parties the agreement came to be \nterminated by Ext. P2 termination notice dated 03.11.1989 \nissued by the appellant. Ext. P2 was followed by Ext. R1(c) \nletter from the managing Partner of the respondent No.1 \nallegedly admitting the breach of contract. Suit notice dated \n06.11.1990 issued by the appellant to the respondent No.1 \nwhich was replied by it as per Ext. P3 dated 31.12.1990 \nrepudiating the alleged breach and raising a counter-claim. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">According to the respondent No.1 there was a long silence \nafter Ext. P3 which was broken on 12.01.1998 on which date \nit received Ext. P4 demand notice from the Deputy Tahsildar \n(RR), Thiruvananthapuram under <a href=\"/doc/201374/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Revenue \nRecovery Act 1968 calling upon it to remit an amount of \nRs.22,10,303/- with future interest at the rate of 12% from \n01.04.97. On receipt of Ext. P4 the respondent No.1 moved the \nHigh Court with Arbitration Request No.2/98 under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_2\">Section \n11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for the \nappointment of an arbitrator for resolution of all disputes and \ndifferences between the parties concerning the performance of \nthe work under Ext. P1 agreement. The request was resisted \nby the appellant contending, inter-alia, that there is no \nprovision for arbitration in Ext. P1 agreement. It was also \ncontended that as per clause 54 of Ext P1 agreement, there is \na specific exclusion of resolution of disputes by arbitration and \nthe Civil Courts at Thiruvananthapurarn alone are clothed \nwith jurisdiction to resolve the disputes arising between the \nparties out of Ext.P1 agreement. In other words, not only Ext. \nP1 does not contain an arbitration clause, on the contrary, \nExt. P1 specifically rules out arbitration as a mode of \nsettlement of disputes or claims arising out of Ext. P1. \nAccepting the said contentions the High Court rejected the \nrequest. After the said order was passed by the High Court, \nthe respondent No.1 filed writ petition, being O.P. No. \n22633/98 to quash Ext. P4 demand notice and for other \nreliefs which came to be disposed of by judgment dated \n17.11.98 directing the District Collector to consider and pass \norders on the representation preferred by the respondent No.1 \nwithin one month from the date of receipt of a copy of the \njudgment. Pending issuance of orders by the District Collector \nas aforesaid, the demand notice as evidenced by Ext. P4 was \nstayed. As a sequel to the judgment, the District Collector \npassed an order rejecting Ext. P8. Upon rejection of Ext.P8 by \nDistrict Collector&#x27;s order Ext.P4 was revived and the \nrespondent No.1 was called upon to pay the amount \nmentioned therein being the loss suffered by the appellant in \nre-arranging the work at the risk and cost of the respondent \nNo.1.  It was at this stage, that the said respondent moved the \nHigh Court by filing a writ petition praying for the issuance of \na writ of certiorari or any other appropriate writ, direction or \norder quashing the order and Ext.P4 demand notice as illegal \nand arbitrary and for the issuance of a writ of mandamus \ndeclaring that revenue recovery proceedings may be initiated \nagainst the respondent No.1 only after prior adjudication by a \ncourt of law or any other independent judicial/quasi-judicial \nbody and other reliefs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">When the writ petition came up for hearing before learned \nSingle Judge, it was contended by the learned counsel for the \nwrit-petitioner that since breach of contract is not admitted, the \nfirst respondent (present appellant), standing in the position of \nanother party to the contract, cannot unilaterally assess the \ndamage alleged to have sustained by it on account of the alleged \ndefault on the part of the writ-petitioner. It was also contended \nthat the amount demanded as per Ext. P4 is time barred. \nFurther contention of the writ-petitioner was that since the \nentire proceedings are barred, a time barred debt cannot be \nrecovered by recourse to revenue recovery proceedings. Stand of \nthe first respondent (present appellant) it is a society owned by \nthe State and, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/280240/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 112</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_4\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> \n(in short the &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_5\">Limitation Act</a>&#x27;) is applicable and in that view, the \ndemand raised is well within time. In view of the nature of the \ncontentions raised, learned Single Judge felt that the matter \nshould be placed before a Division Bench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">The Division Bench proceeded on the basis as if the main \nquestion that arose for consideration was where a breach of \nconditions of a contract is not admitted, whether is open for \nthe contractee to adjudicate upon the disputed question of \nbreach as well as to assess the damages arising from the \nbreach.  Though the High Court take note of the fact that the \nappellants placed reliance on the document Ex.RI (C) to \ncontend that there was admitted breach of contract which \nresulted in termination of the contract, the respondent No.1 \ndisputed the position and submitted that no breach of \ncontract can be spelt out as seen from the document Ex.P3.  \nHigh Court came to the conclusion that one of the contracting \nparties cannot adjudicate upon a disputed question of breach \nas well as assess the damage arising from the breach. It, \nhowever, noted that the position would be different where \nthere is no dispute or there is consensus between the \ncontracting parties regarding breach of conditions.  In such a \ncase an officer of the State even though a party to the contract \nwill be well within its right in assessing the damages in view of \nthe specific terms of clause 12 of the Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">In support of the appeals, learned counsel for the \nappellants submitted that there was no dispute about breach \nof contract.  In fact, in the letter dated 14.2.1990 Ex.R1(C) it \nwas accepted that there was breach of contract. The relevant \nportions of the document read as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;We fully realize that the above demand \nput forth by the then General Manger \nSreekumar asking for enhancement of rates is \nagainst the spirit of the agreed contract and \nthat is why the museum and the Government \ntook the decision to rearrange the work \nthrough some other agency at out risk and \ncost.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">We therefore, humbly request you to \nkindly permit us to withdraw the company&#x27;s \nletter referred above and offer the said work by \nour company.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">1.\tWe are ready to complete the work \nwithout any change in the rates for all \ntimes of work that we have agreed \npreviously.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">2.\tWe are ready to complete the work in \nall aspects without even giving us any \nMobilisation advance by the museum.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">3.\tWe request for an extension of 12 \nmonths time to complete the work in all \nrespects and we will strive our level best \nto finish the same much in advance.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">It was further submitted that before the learned Single \nJudge it was not disputed that there was a breach of contract. \nIn fact, the only point urged before learned Single Judge \nrelated to the question whether the claim was barred by time.  \nStand was that a time barred demand cannot be enforced \nthrough revenue recovery proceedings. That was the issue \nwhich forms subject-matter of dispute and considering the \nimportance of that matter, learned single judge felt that the \nmatter should be heard by a Division Bench. It was submitted \nthat when a reference is made by learned Single Judge to the \nDivision Bench on a particular issue, the Division Bench \ncannot travel beyond that issue and decide other matters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">\tIn response, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 \nsubmitted that in fact there was no reference by learned Single \nJudge, who only held that considering the importance of the \nmatter the case should be heard by a Division Bench. It is also \nsubmitted that there was dispute regarding breach of \nconditions of contract.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1575163\" id=\"span_1\">It is fairly well settled that when reference is made on a \nspecific issued either by a learned Single Judge or Division \nBench to a larger Bench i.e. Division Bench or Full Bench or \nConstitution Bench, as the case may be, the Larger Bench \ncannot adjudicate upon an issue which is not the question \nreferred.

Union of India and \nOthers</a> [1981 (Supp.)</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1063918\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"205718\" id=\"span_3\"><a href=\"/doc/205718/\" id=\"a_7\">SCC 38], Samaresh Chandra Bose v.

Learned Single Judge felt that in view of the \ncontentions, a Division Bench should hear the case.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">We find that before learned Single Judge there was \npractically no dispute that there was breach of conditions of \ncontract.  In fact learned Single Judge noted the position as \nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;The question of termination of contract with \neffect from 25.11.1989 is not disputed.  \nPetitioner did not challenge the termination \norder.  As per the terms of the contract, if it is \nre-tendered, the difference in the re-tender \namount and the loss suffered have to be paid \nby the petitioner apart from the liquid \ndamages.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">\t\t\t\t\t(Underlined for emphasis)\n\nThe learned Single Judge also noted that the main \ncontention of the writ petitioner was that the amount \ndemanded was time barred.  Reference was made to <a href=\"/doc/87779479/\" id=\"a_9\">Section \n71</a> of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act, 1968. Therefore, it was \ncontended before learned Single Judge that when the matter is \ntime barred even if the demand is correct it cannot be enforced \nthrough revenue recovery proceedings. Stand of the appellants \non the contrary was that the society is owned by the State \nand, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/280240/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 112</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_11\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> is \napplicable and the demand was raised within time.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\tConsidering the rival submissions learned Single Judge \nheld that in view of the nature of contention the matter should \nbe heard by a Division Bench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">\tUnfortunately the Division Bench did not consider the \ncontentions which were raised before the learned Single \nJudge. It also did not record any positive finding as to whether \nthe document relied upon by the appellant clearly established \nadmission of a breach of contract. The portion of the order of \nlearned Single Judge, quoted above, suggests that there was \nno dispute when read in the context of the letter dated \n14.2.1990. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">As rightly contended by learned counsel for the appellant \nthe basic issue related to the question whether the demand \nwas barred by limitation.  As noted above the Division Bench \nof the High Court did not examine this question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">Above being the question we set aside the order of the \nDivision Bench and remit the matter back for fresh \nconsideration limiting the examination to the question whether \nthe demand by barred by limitation. Interim order dated \n1.10.1999 shall be operative till the disposal of the matter by \nthe Division Bench. We make it clear that merely because \ninterim protection has been given that shall not be considered \nto be expression of opinion on merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
