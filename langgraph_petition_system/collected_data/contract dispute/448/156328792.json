While ARBA Nos.37,\n\n     38, 41, 42 and 43 of 2015 are the appeals under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 37</a> of the\n\n     1996 Act, the remaining cases in the batch are the applications under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the 1996 Act. The appellants/applicants are the\n\n     contractors who were awarded different contracts for construction,\n\n     upgradation and maintenance of rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri\n\n     Gram Sadak Yojna (&#x27;PMGSY&#x27;, in short). Out of the five arbitration\n\n     appeals preferred by Brij Mohan Agrawal, in three cases the contract\n\n     has been executed whereas in remaining two appeals the contract\n\n     has been terminated. Similarly, in other cases which are applications\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the 1996 Act, for appointment of Arbitrator, the\n\n     contract has been terminated for one reason or the other.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_96\">2.   In the three completed contract cases appellant Brij Mohan Agrawal\n\n     had earlier preferred WPC Nos. 549, 550 and 551 of 2013. The said\n\n     writ petitions were disposed of by the Division Bench of this Court on\n\n     26-4-14 with an observation that since the petitioner is a party to the\n\n     contract which contains an arbitration clause, if     the petitioner so\n\n     desires, he may initiate proceedings under the 1996 Act. The Division\n\n     Bench further observed that if the State proceeds to recover the\n\n     amount, the appellant may make a prayer for stay on submission of\n\n     security deposit. Appellant Brij Mohan Agrawal, thereafter, preferred\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         10</span>\n\n     application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 9</a> of the 1996 Act seeking interim order for\n\n     staying the recovery proceedings. The District Judge has refused to\n\n     interfere on the ground that in three cases wherein the writ petitions\n\n     were preferred, the appellant had already obtained observations from\n\n     the High Court which would serve the purpose. In other two cases the\n\n     District Judge has held that the contract executed between the parties\n\n     being &#x27;works contract&#x27;, it is amenable to jurisdiction of the State\n\n     Arbitration Tribunal, therefore, application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 9</a> of the 1996\n\n     Act is not maintainable.

In the application under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11 (6)</a> the applicants averred that\n\n     being successful tenderer they were awarded contract and the work\n\n     order was also issued, however, because of several hindrances and\n\n     impediments in execution of work due to naxal activities in the\n\n     concerned area and for failure of the respondents in taking technical\n\n     decisions in time, there was delay in execution of contract. Request\n\n     for extension of time was made, however, the respondents terminated\n\n     the contract without considering the application for extension of time.\n\n     The applicants, thereafter, invoked arbitration clause as contained in\n\n     clause 24 and 25 of the agreement by moving an application to claim\n\n     a quantified amount, however, it remained undecided, therefore,\n\n     applicants have moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the\n\n     1996 Act for appointment of Arbitrator.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                         11</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"122362\" id=\"span_11\">4.      Shri Kishore Bhaduri, learned counsel appearing with Shri Rahul Jha,\n\n        learned counsel for the applicants/appellants would argue that in view\n\n        of the laid down by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/122362/\" id=\"a_10\">Firm Ashok Traders and\n\n        Another v.

Learned counsel\n\n        would further submit that the Project Implementation Unit (&#x27;PIU&#x27; in\n\n        short) constituted by the State Government is a society for\n\n        implementation of 100% centrally funded scheme of the Central\n\n        Government named as PMGSY, therefore, the said PIU not being a\n\n        public undertaking or the instrumentality of the State, the contract in\n\n        question would not amount to works contract, therefore, for this\n\n        reason also the 1983 Adhiniyam would not apply.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_101\">5.      Shri Bhaduri would next submit that in three appeals preferred by Birj\n\n        Mohan Agrawal, this Court has passed an order in writ jurisdiction\n\n        reserving liberty in favour of the appellant to proceed under the 1996\n\n        Act, therefore, the District Judge could not have rejected the\n\n        application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 9</a> of the 1996 Act. Shri Bhaduri would lastly\n\n        argue that the 1983 Adhiniyam is repugnant to the 1996 Act,\n\n        therefore, if the contract contains arbitration clause and a dispute has\n\n1    (2004) 3 SCC 155\n2    AIR 2012 SC 1228\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          12</span>\n\n         arisen the same has to be processed under the 1996 Act hence, the\n\n         applications under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 9</a> as well as under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the\n\n         1996 Act are maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_13\">6.

There is no dispute about the fact that the tender process in all the\n\n         cases were processed in similar manner. The NITs were issued by the\n\n         Government of Chhattisgarh, Panchayat and Rural Development\n\n         Department, Chhattisgarh Rural Road Development Agency, Raipur.\n\n         The letter of acceptance of tender filed as Annexure A-1 in ARBA\n\n3    AIR 2008 SC 2454\n4    AIR 2008 Madhya Pradesh 72\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                        13</span>\n\n     No.9 of 2015 would clearly mention that it has been issued by the\n\n     Government of Chhattisgarh. Thus, even if the PMGSY scheme is\n\n     100% centrally funded scheme, the execution thereof has been\n\n     entrusted to the State Government. The Central Government only\n\n     provides required fund and issues the basic norms and guidelines\n\n     within which the project will be implemented. The amount spent under\n\n     the PMGSY scheme is disbursed by the Government treasury through\n\n     the Chhattisgarh Rural Road Development Agency and the account\n\n     thereof including the allotment of fund is made by the Panchayat and\n\n     Rural Development Department of the Government of Chhattisgarh.\n\n     Thus, there is absolutely no element of doubt that the Chhattisgarh\n\n     Rural Road Development Agency is the instrumentality of the State,\n\n     even though it is created as a Society under the provisions of the\n\n     Chhattisgarh Societies Registrikaran Adhiniyam, 1973 to function\n\n     under the control of the Panchayat and Rural Development\n\n     Department.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">8.

The judgment of the Gujarat\n\n          High Court was challenged by a contractor before the Supreme Court.\n\n          Dismissing the SLP, the Supreme Court held thus :</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">                         1)    The award in the present case,\n                         though given prior to 1/1/1994 which is the\n                         date of commencement of the Gujarat\n                         Public Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration\n                         tribunal Act, 1992, had not attained finality\n                         at the time when the said Act came into\n                         force. Under <a href=\"/doc/157537/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 21</a> of the said Act, the\n7     (1999) 3 SCC 114\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                         23</span>\n\n                   provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_62\">Arbitration Act</a> shall,\n                   insofar as they are inconsistent with the\n                   provisions of the Act, cease to apply to any\n                   dispute arising from a works contract and all\n                   arbitration proceedings in relation to such\n                   dispute before an arbitrator, umpire, court\n                   or authority shall stand transferred to the\n                   tribunal. In the present case, the arbitration\n                   proceedings in relation to the dispute were\n                   pending before the court and hence the\n                   High court has rightly transferred these\n                   proceedings to the tribunal.

Although the 1983 Adhiniyam has no provision for transfer of pending\n\n      arbitration matters to the Tribunal, yet <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 20</a> of the 1983\n\n      Adhiniyam provides that as from the date of the constitution of the\n\n      Tribunal and notwithstanding anything contained in <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_66\">Arbitration Act,\n\n      1940</a> or any other law, for the time being in force, or in any agreement\n\n      or usage to the contrary, no civil court shall have jurisdiction to\n\n      entertain or decide any dispute of which cognizance can be taken by\n\n      the Tribunal under his Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_139\">22.   By necessary implication, on and from the date of constitution of\n\n      Tribunal, the jurisdiction of civil Court is barred, therefore, application\n\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 9</a> which is presented before the Principal Civil Court of\n\n      original jurisdiction i.e. District Judge, is barred. Similarly, clause 25 of\n\n      the contract having provided that resolution of the dispute can only be\n\n      by the Arbitration Tribunal under the 1983 Adhiniyam, the parties to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                            24</span>\n\n          the contract have by mutual consent surrendered to the jurisdiction to\n\n          the Tribunal, therefore, the appellants/ applicants are not entitled to\n\n          proceed under any other law except the 1983 Adhiniyam.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">23.       In taking the above view, this Court is fortified by judgment rendered\n\n          by the Privy Council in Attorney General for Manitoba v.

In the cases at hand, the arbitration agreement has chosen to refer\n\n          the dispute for decision making to the Tribunal created under the 1983\n\n          Adhiniyam.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">25.       It also needs to be noticed that <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 2 (3)</a> of the 1996 Act provides\n\n          that this part of the Act (including <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections 9</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_70\">11</a>) shall not affect any\n\n          other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes\n\n          may not be submitted to arbitration. Thus, the 1996 Act itself saves\n\n          such State laws which provides separate forum for raising dispute on\n\n          arbitration matters involving contract entered into by the State or by\n\n          public undertakings. For this reason also the 1996 Act would have no\n\n          effect on the applicability of the 1983 Adhiniyam for resolving a\n\n          reference emanating from a works contract as defined under <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 2\n\n          (1) (i)</a> of the 1983 Adhiniyam.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_144\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">26.       The submission of the appellants/applicants to the effect that the 1983\n\n          Adhiniyam is repugnant to the 1996 Act is not to be considered in\n\n          absence of any challenge to the constitutional validity of the 1983\n\n          Adhiniyam. Even otherwise, the 1983 Adhiniyam has been enacted\n\n8     (1922) 1 AC 268\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                          25</span>\n\n          by drawing power under Entry No.13 of List III (Concurrent List) of the\n\n          VII Schedule of the Constitution of India. The 1983 Adhiniyam having\n\n          already received the Presidential assent, the argument regarding\n\n          repugnancy has no substance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">    27.
