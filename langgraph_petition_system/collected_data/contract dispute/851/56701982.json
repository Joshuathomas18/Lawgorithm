The factual matrix of the case is that the\n\npetitioner/accused No.1 in W.P.No.200439/2021 is the\n\nCompany M/s Sri Avantika Contractors (I) Limited (SACIL),\n\nrepresented   by    its   Managing        Director   and   the\n\npetitioner/accused No.2 in W.P.No.200441/2021 is the\n\nProprietor of M/s Pentagon Surveys.          The case of the\n\nrespondent No.1-CBI that the respondent No.2 - National\n\nThermal Power Project (NTPC) during the year 2012-13\n\nwas entrusted the work of site leveling to M/s Sri Avantika\n\nContractors (I) Limited i.e., accused No.1 and in turn the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       6</span>\n\n\naccused No.1 entrusted the work of survey the same to\n\nthe accused No.2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">        3.      The respondent No.2-NTPC is the public sector\n\nundertaking       engaging      the   business   of   generation   of\n\nelectricity and allied activites, awarded the work of Site\n\nLevelling and Infrastructure Works Package for its Kudgi\n\nSuper        Thermal    Power    Project   Stage-I    (3x800   MW),\n\nKarnataka to the accused No.1 and in terms of the\n\ncontract, an agreement was executed on 02.04.2012 for\n\nthe value of work an amount of Rs.154,34,54,426/-. The\n\nscheduled period for completion of the work was 30\n\nmonths started from 27.02.2012 and the completion on\n\n26.08.2014.       Subsequently, contract value was increased\n\nto Rs.183.54 crore and again the same was increased to\n\n189.03 crore.          Though 30 months time was fixed, there\n\nwere various reasons for the delay hence, the said work\n\ncould not be completed and the respondent No.2 granted\n\nan extension of six months up to February 2015. Certain\n\ndisputes arose between the parties regarding the initial\n\nlevels and the quantities in the RA bills, leading to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                             7</span>\n\n\ntermination of the contract by NTPC on 24.03.2014. The\n\ncontract (GCC) provided that Dispute Settlement Clause\n\nand several disputes that arose were referred to the\n\nDispute Resolution Board (DRB).     As the decision of the\n\nDRB was not acceptable to both the parties, the parties\n\nresorted to the clause that provided for Dispute Settlement\n\nMechanism under the Contract and according to which the\n\ndispute has been agreed to be resolved through Arbitration\n\nconsisting of a panel of three Member Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nThe accused No.1 presented claim for 36 items for the\n\ntotal amount of Rs.139.14 crore. The accused No.2 made\n\na counter claim for 16 items. The Arbitration Tribunal by\n\nits arbitral award dated 07.07.2017 accepted five claims of\n\nthe petitioner No.1 company and awarded an amount of\n\nRs.50,21,54,497/- and rest of the claims were rejected\n\nand interest at 14% per annum was awarded. As regards\n\nclaims of NTPC, Tribunal accepted four of their counter\n\nclaims and rejected the rest of the claims and awarded an\n\namount of Rs.2,67,23,699/-.     Upon setting off the claim\n\nawarded to the petitioner company as against the counter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                              8</span>\n\n\nclaim award to NTPC, it was held that an amount of\n\nRs.47,54,30,798/- was due by NTPC to the petitioner\n\ncompany. The said award is marked as Annexure-D. The\n\ncharge sheet, FIR and the order sheet for having taken the\n\ncognizance are marked as Annexures- A to C.          The said\n\naward has been challenged before the Single Judge at\n\nDelhi High Court and Delhi High Court confirmed the award\n\npassed by the Arbitration.          In the meanwhile, the\n\nrespondent No.1-CBI based on the source information\n\ninvestigated the matter and filed the charge sheet after\n\nthe Arbitral award. The case has been registered against\n\nthe accused No.1 and also against the officials of the NTPC\n\nin R.C.15(A)/2017 CBI ACB BLR and issued FIR in terms of\n\nAnnexure-B    and    suspected      offences   are   criminal\n\nconspiracy, cheating, using forged documents as genuine\n\nfalsification of accounts, criminal misconduct by the public\n\nservant. Wherein    the   accused    No.1-M.V.Padmakumar,\n\nSenior Manager (Civil), NTPC, S.S.Nathan-accused No.2\n\nAGM (Safety), retired, NTPC and V.K.Pradhan-accused\n\nNo.3, General Manager (Project), NTPC and the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                  9</span>\n\n\nNo.1 arrayed as accused No.4 and also against the non-\n\nofficials   of    NTPC   and   others.   The   CBI   after   the\n\ninvestigation filed the charge sheet under <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 173(2)</a>\n\nof Cr.P.C., against the accused No.1 and accused No.2 and\n\nanother accused No.3 the then Project Managers of the\n\naccused No.1 company and left out the original accused\n\ni.e., accused Nos.1 to 3 in FIR.         The charges leveled\n\nagainst these petitioners that two sets of records are\n\nprepared, one with actual measurements and second one\n\nwith inflated quantities/measurements and signed second\n\nset of site level records which facilitated M/s SACIL in\n\nusing the said fabricated records to submit highly inflated\n\nfalse bills to the tune of Rs.45.15 crore and based on the\n\nsaid fabricated data made subsequent arbitration claim for\n\nRs.57.06 crore, after NTPC finally terminated the contract\n\nwith them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">       4.        The investigation reveal that two sets of\n\nground level data submitted by M/s. SACIL i.e., accused\n\nNo.1 company is fabricated and brief of the fact that in the\n\nNTPC, original ground levels data bear the signatures of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                10</span>\n\n\nsome of the officials of NTPC but there is no any role of the\n\nsaid officials of the NTPC and though the signatures are\n\nobtained fraudulently by the accused No.1, it is also an\n\nallegation against the accused No.2 that in collusion with\n\nthe accused No.1 got surveyed the land and measured by\n\nthe surveyor who is authorised surveyor of M/s SACIL and\n\nhence, invoked the above offences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      5.     The counsel appearing for both the petitioners\n\nhave vehemently contended that the contract agreement\n\nwas entered between the accused No.1 and NTPC on\n\n02.04.2012 and the same was terminated on 24.03.2014\n\nand the matter was referred to three Members panel\n\nArbitration and both of them have made the claim on\n\n23.01.2016     and    after   due    enquiry,    the   Tribunal,\n\nunanimous     award    has    been   passed     on   07.07.2017\n\nconsidering the claim of both the parties.             The very\n\ncontention of the counsel for the petitioners that after 100\n\ndays of the award and more than 3½ years after the\n\ndispute started, CBI suo motu on the basis of the source\n\ninformation, registered the FIR against some of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                              11</span>\n\n\nofficials of NTPC and the accused No.1 invoking the offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 120(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_13\">420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_14\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_15\">471</a>, <a href=\"/doc/722115/\" id=\"a_16\">477(A)</a> of IPC and\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/86648814/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 13(2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of PC Act\n\nbut there was no reference to arbitral award whatsoever.\n\nThe counsel would submits that NTPC challenged the\n\naward before the Delhi High Court invoking <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 34</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration and Reconciliation Act and the Delhi High\n\nCourt after hearing both the parties, dismissed the petition\n\nfiled by the respondent No.2 and confirmed the award\n\npassed by the Arbitral Tribunal and uphold the same as\n\ngenuine. NTPC has filed the appeal before the Division\n\nBench which is pending for consideration.        The counsel\n\nalso would vehemently contend that CBI filed the final\n\nreport before the learned Magistrate exonerating the\n\nofficials of NTPC for all the offences including <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 13(2)</a>\n\nof the PC Act as it named in the FIR and only against\n\naccused No.1 and accused No.2 filed charge sheet and the\n\nlearned Magistrate took the cognizance.         The counsel\n\nvehemently contented that the dispute between the parties\n\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal is regarding the measurement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                             12</span>\n\n\nrecorded in Original Ground Level Data.      The petitioner\n\ncompany has relied on the data sheets signed by the\n\nauthorised representatives of NTPC and other engineers as\n\nalso by the authorised representatives of the company.\n\nThe NTPC relied upon the measurement data sheets signed\n\nby their various representatives and other officials as also\n\nby one Augustin who is admittedly not an authorised\n\nrepresentative of the company who was a only helper to\n\nthe survey team. After detailed scrutiny and discussions,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal accepted the measurement data\n\nsheets relied upon by the company-accused No.1. The\n\ngrievance of NTPC was with regard to finding of fact\n\nrecorded by the Arbitral Tribunal and the learned Single\n\nJudge of Delhi High Court concurred with the finding\n\nrecorded by Arbitral Tribunal.   The dispute between the\n\nparties are purely on civil in nature and the matter has\n\nbeen adjudicated upon by the Arbitral Tribunal with the\n\nconsent of both the parties and the same have been\n\nupheld by the learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court\n\nand invoking of criminal prosecution belatedly that too by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                              13</span>\n\n\nthe action of CBI and exonerating the NTPC officials under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 13</a> of the PC Act and filing of the present charge\n\nsheet against the petitioners is nothing but an abuse of\n\nprocess of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">      6.     The counsel vehemently contended that the\n\nFIR registered after the Arbitral award and charge sheet\n\nwas filed only after the appeal was filed before the Division\n\nBench.     The counsel would vehemently contend that the\n\ncivil dispute between the parties is a contractual dispute\n\nbut given the criminal colour that too after passing the\n\nArbitral award consisting of three Members panel. The\n\ncounsel also would vehemently contend that the CBI action\n\nwas based on the malafide source information that too\n\nhelp respondent No.2, CBI took up the investigation. It is\n\nnothing but colourable exercise of powers by CBI. The FIR\n\nis filed with the object of nullifying the Arbitral award and\n\neven Delhi High Court also confirmed the award passed by\n\nthe arbitrator. The learned Magistrate has not applied its\n\nmind while taking the cognizance and failed to take note of\n\nthe fact that the other officials of NTPC are exonerated.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                14</span>\n\n\nThe   offences which have       been invoked        against   the\n\npetitioners does not attracts any of the ingredients of\n\nthose offences and investigation conducted by the CBI is\n\none   sided   investigation.        The   counsel   also   would\n\nvehemently contended that FIR has been registered at the\n\nfirst instance against the officials of the NTPC as there was\n\nno complaint by NTPC. But only on the basis of source\n\ninformation, if there is any dispute between the parties,\n\nthe same has to be considered only by the Arbitrator in\n\nterms of the contract.    Civil disputes already before the\n\narbitrator and arbitrators also decided the claim of both\n\nthe parities and when such being the case, ought not to\n\nhave been invoked the criminal prosecution and arbitrators\n\nare also qualified engineers and even second set of\n\ndocuments filed by the company are also signed by the\n\nofficials of NTPC.   The counsel also vehemently contend\n\nthat when <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 13</a> of PC Act was not invoked, the CBI\n\nwill not get any jurisdiction to investigate the matter and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 13</a> of PC Act invoked only to invoke the jurisdiction\n\nof CBI. The other petitioner i.e., the accused No.2 is only\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     15</span>\n\n\nthe surveyor and the said work was entrusted by the\n\naccused No.1 and carried out the survey work and the\n\nsame has been accepted by both the company and counter\n\nsigned by the NTPC.              When such being the case, there\n\ncannot be any criminal prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      7.

No finding was\n\ngiven by Arbitral Tribunal with regard to fabrication and so\n\nalso learned Single Judge. The arbitral award finding is\n\nthat it is contractual obligation and not discussed anything\n\nabout fabrication.   The criminal prosecution initiated for\n\nfabrication of documents and no case is made out to\n\ninvoke <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. The judgments which have\n\nbeen relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nare not applicable to the case on hand and the same are in\n\nrespect of strained relationship and when the arbitration\n\nwas pending.

The\n\nlearned counsel brought to the notice of this Court <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n\n3</a> of the Evidence Act and submits that Arbitrator is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                              21</span>\n\n\nexempted and whether award is admissible or not is\n\nquestion before the Court and under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_38\">Evidence Act</a>,\n\nArbitrator cannot discharge his duties in consonance with\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_39\">Evidence Act</a>.

The Arbitrator is not a\n\nCourt. When such being the case, the very contention of\n\nthe petitioner that arbitration award is pending before the\n\nCourt for consideration and hence, there cannot be any\n\ncriminal prosecution cannot be accepted. The arbitration is\n\nonly for limited purpose and power under the arbitration\n\nappeal is also very limited. This Court cannot look into the\n\nfinding of the arbitration award.     Both the actions are\n\ndistinct and criminal acts are found only after verification.\n\nNTPC is a Central Government undertaking and there is\n\nloss of Rs.47.00 crores if the criminal prosecution is\n\nquashed and jurisdiction of the trial Court cannot be\n\nscuttled by quashing the proceedings invoking Section 482\n\nof Cr.P.C.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                        22</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">       14.     In reply to the arguments of the learned\n\ncounsel for respondent Nos.1 and 2, the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioners brought to the notice of this Court\n\nclause-7.3 of the agreement between the parties and\n\nsubmits that dispute is only with regard to the data of the\n\nwork    done    in      respect    of       ground    level    and    actual\n\nmeasurement has to be tested by the Arbitrator only and\n\nnot by criminal Court. The learned counsel also submitted\n\nthat authorized signatory Praveen of NTPC has signed the\n\ndocuments and dispute is also considered by the Arbitrator\n\nand documents are signed by both the parties. He also\n\nsubmitted that only <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_42\">IPC</a> offences are invoked and not the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_43\">PC Act</a> offences. When such being the case, CBI has no\n\npower    to    investigate       the    matter       and   <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_44\">Prevention       of\n\nCorruption Act</a> only invoked to book these petitioners and\n\nultimately exonerated the officials of NTPC.                    When such\n\nbeing the case, it amounts to colorable exercise of powers\n\nwithout reference to the award and the Court has to take\n\nnote of the timings of the initiation of the criminal\n\nprosecution     i.e.,    after    the       award, the        case   is   also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                               23</span>\n\n\nregistered after filing the appeal before the High Court and\n\nin order to over-reach the finding, criminal law was set in\n\nmotion. When NTPC failed before the Arbitrator filed\n\ncriminal case with the aid of CBI and hence, it requires\n\ninterference by exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 482</a> of\n\nCr.P.C., or otherwise it amounts to abuse of process and it\n\nleads to miscarriage of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">      15.

Having heard the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners    and   the   learned   counsel   appearing   for\n\nrespondent Nos.1 and 2 in both the cases and having\n\nconsidered the material on record, the point that would\n\narise for consideration of this Court is,\n\n\n              Whether initiation of criminal prosecution\n      against the petitioners is an abuse of process\n      in respect of contractual dispute between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                24</span>\n\n\n      parties by giving criminal colour to the civil\n      dispute as contended by both the petitioners?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">      17.    Having heard the learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the respective petitioners and the learned counsel\n\nappearing for the respondents, there is no dispute between\n\nthe parties that there was contract agreement between\n\nM/s. Avantika Contractors and NTPC and estimated cost is\n\nRs.189 crores. Both the counsels not disputed the contract\n\nagreement dated 02.04.2012. It is also not in dispute that\n\nthe contract was terminated by respondent No.2 on\n\n24.03.2014. It is also not in dispute that the matter was\n\nreferred    to   a   three   Members   Panel   Arbitration   on\n\n23.01.2016. The dispute was also with respect to Original\n\nGround Level Data, each party relying on conflicting data\n\nsheets. There is no dispute with regard to first set of\n\ndocuments. The dispute is only with regard to R.A.Bill\n\nNo.15 claiming that those documents are fabricated\n\ndocuments. The said issue of documents are fabricated in\n\nsecond set of documents is also           raised before the\n\nArbitrators. The Arbitrators taking into note of the material\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                              25</span>\n\n\non record allowed the claim of accused No.1-company\n\npartly as well as respondent No.2/NTPC claim partly. It is\n\nalso not in dispute that CBI registered FIR on the basis of\n\nsource information arraying first three accused persons as\n\nofficials of respondent No.2/company. FIR was registered\n\non 27.08.2017. It is clear that arbitration award was\n\npassed on 07.07.2017 wherein the NTPC only got claim to\n\nthe extent of Rs.2,67,23,699/- and as against accused\n\nNo.1/company got Rs.47,54,30,798/-, difference is huge.\n\nAdmittedly, FIR is registered after three and half years of\n\nthe dispute started i.e., in the year 2014. Immediately\n\nafter the dispute is started no criminal compliant is filed by\n\nthe NTPC, instead after Arbitral Award, FIR was registered\n\ni.e., after more than three and half years of the dispute\n\nand that too no complaint is given by respondent No.2, but\n\nsuo-moto case is registered by respondent No.1 on the\n\nbasis of source information.      First of all, the claim was\n\nmade based on R.A.Bill No.15 relating to second set of\n\ndocuments, the same is also with regard to measurement\n\nand contract was also terminated on 24.03.2014 by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                             26</span>\n\n\nrespondent No.2.   It is not in dispute that there was a\n\ncontract agreement between M/s Avantika Contractors (I)\n\nLtd., and NTPC and there is clause in the agreement dated\n\n02.04.2012 that if any dispute arises between the parties,\n\nthe same has to be referred to Arbitrators.       It is also\n\nimportant to note that based on the said documents, a\n\nclaim was made and for a period of three years no\n\ncomplaint was given. The complaint was given only after\n\nNTPC has suffered order passed by the three Arbitrators\n\nwho have been appointed by both the parties.       The said\n\nissue of claim based on the second set of documents and\n\nthe said claim made during arbitration and the arbitrators\n\nhave given an unanimous finding and considered the claim\n\nof both accused No.1 as well as respondent No.2. It is also\n\nimportant to note that the said arbitration award was also\n\nchallenged before the learned Single Judge i.e., on\n\n13.10.2017   and   suo   moto    case   was   registered   on\n\n27.10.2017 after fourteen days of filing appeal invoking\n\n<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and Reconciliation Act. The\n\nlearned single Judge also confirmed the award passed by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                   27</span>\n\n\nthe Arbitrator. First of all, it is clear that there was contract\n\nagreement between the parties and also there is recital in\n\nthe agreement that if there is any dispute the same shall\n\nbe referred to the Arbitrators and accordingly, the matter\n\nwas also referred to the Arbitration in the year 2016 itself\n\nand hence, it is clear that after suffering an award by the\n\nArbitrators,     respondent      No.1   set    up     for     criminal\n\nprosecution against the petitioners herein at the instance\n\nof respondent No.2.        It is also claim of respondent No.1\n\nthat no complaint is given, but they investigated the\n\nmatter based on the source of information.                  It is also\n\nimportant to note that respondent No.1 registered the case\n\nagainst the officials of NTPC arraying them as accused\n\nNos.1 to 3. But only arrayed accused No.4 in the FIR as\n\naccused No.1 in the charge sheet, but exonerated accused\n\nNos.1 to 3 who have been arrayed as accused Nos.1 to 3\n\nin the FIR. It has to be noted that allegation against the\n\npetitioners    herein that       they indulged      in creation     of\n\ndocuments along with accused Nos.1 to 3 of FIR. But\n\nadmitted      fact   is   that   authorized   representatives       of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                             28</span>\n\n\nrespondent   No.2/company     have   countersigned    those\n\ndocuments and when those officials who have arrayed as\n\naccused Nos.1 to 3 in the FIR were exonerated, how come\n\nthese petitioners become accused and committed offence\n\nof creation of documents and forgery when the counter\n\nsigned officials of NTPC officials are exonerated. Hence, it\n\nis clear that these petitioners have been arrayed as\n\naccused only with malafide intention. Though the offences\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_47\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> are invoked in the\n\nFIR, the same was not pressed into service, but only <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_48\">IPC</a>\n\noffences are invoked against only these petitioners. It is\n\nalso not in dispute that the NTPC officials who have signed\n\nthose documents have been exonerated and the offences\n\nof creation of documents are invoked only against these\n\npetitioners and officials of NTPC are given clean chit,\n\nhence, the same is nothing but an abuse of process. Apart\n\nfrom that, when the matter was referred to the Arbitrator,\n\nan arbitration award was suffered by respondent No.2 and\n\nthereafter only after thought through respondent No.1\n\ncriminal prosecution is initiated and subsequently suffered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                              29</span>\n\n\nan order     from the Delhi High Court confirming the\n\narbitration award.   It is also pertinent to note that the\n\ncharge sheet was filed subsequently when the matter is\n\npending before the Division Bench i.e., on 22.12.2020.\n\nWhen they failed to succeed before the Arbitration as well\n\nas before the Single Bench at Delhi High Court, the charge\n\nsheet was filed on 22.12.2020 when the appeal filed by\n\nrespondent No.2 was pending before the Division Bench.\n\nThe issue of second set of documents was also considered\n\nbefore the Arbitrators. The very contention of learned\n\ncounsel for respondent No.2 that the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_49\">Evidence Act</a> is not\n\napplicable and hence, offences under the Penal provisions\n\ncannot be decided by the Arbitrator cannot be accepted for\n\nthe reason that it is nothing but giving criminal color to the\n\ncivil dispute between the parties that too dispute is in\n\nrespect of only measurement and NTPC officials are also\n\ncountersigned those documents and hence, question of\n\nfabrication of documents does not arise.      I have already\n\npointed out, when the officials of the NTPC are also part of\n\nthe documents of second set which is claim made in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                 30</span>\n\n\nrespect of R.A.Bill No.15, there cannot be two yardsticks\n\nexonerating   the   officials    of   respondent   No.2   and\n\nregistering the case against petitioners herein.      Hence,\n\nthere is force in the contention of the learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioners that it is nothing but colourable exercise of\n\npower by the CBI in respect of the civil dispute and action\n\nof respondent No.1 is nothing but malafide intention and\n\nonly to help respondent No.2, the criminal prosecution is\n\ninitiated against the petitioners herein, as contended by\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners. The principles <a href=\"/doc/118326933/\" id=\"a_50\">laid\n\ndown in</a> the judgments referred to by the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioners are aptly applicable to the case on hand.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"485334\" id=\"span_35\">The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/485334/\" id=\"a_51\">Maksud Saiyed vs. State of\n\nGujarat and Others</a> reported in 2008(5) SCC 668\n\nheld that initiation of criminal prosecution is a serious\n\nmatter. The judgment referred by the petitioners counsel\n\nwherein held that it is nothing but giving criminal colour to\n\nthe civil dispute between the parties and there was delay\n\nin initiating criminal prosecution and that too the same has\n\nbeen initiated through CBI only based on some information\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                31</span>\n\n\nand not on any complaint by respondent No.2. It is also\n\nundisputed    fact   that   respondent   No.2   is   a   Central\n\nGovernment Undertaking and hence, it is clear that with\n\nmalafide intention criminal prosecution is initiated through\n\nrespondent No.1 and further exonerated the officials of the\n\nrespondent No.2 and only initiated criminal prosecution\n\nagainst the petitioners. The same fortifies the contention of\n\nthe petitioners herein.
