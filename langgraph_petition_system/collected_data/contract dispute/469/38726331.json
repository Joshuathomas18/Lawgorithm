The defendant no.2, its\n         director     and        his    family           members             continued                 to\n         assure that the debt amount shall be repaid and\n         they will not transfer the ownership of vessel.\n         The plaintiff has, therefore, not taken any legal\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                             Page 6 of 49</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                   Page 6 of 49        Created On Tue Nov 03 00:34:11 IST 2015\n                    O/AS/34/2015                                                   ORDER\n\n\n\n         action    and       relied       upon           the      assurances               of      the\n         defendant       no.2.

In fact, the plaintiff has\n         stated in the plaint in paragraphs 3.4 that the\n         vessel    is       sold     to      Glamour              Maritime              SA          in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          Page 12 of 49</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                Page 12 of 49       Created On Tue Nov 03 00:34:11 IST 2015\n                    O/AS/34/2015                                                     ORDER\n\n\n\n         February, 2013, even then, Glamour Maritime SA is\n         not joined as party-defendant while filing the\n         Admiralty Suit.

Learned             counsel           Mr.          Thakore              thereafter\n         contended that the plaintiff has based this suit\n         on an alleged agreement dated 4.10.2011 executed\n         between the plaintiff and defendant no.2. Learned\n         counsel       referred            to       clause            16       of       the        said\n         agreement. The said clause provides for referring\n         the dispute to the arbitrator. Thus, in view of\n         the     arbitration           agreement,                   the        suit         is       not\n         maintainable.             Learned           counsel             places            reliance\n         upon    the     decision           rendered               by       the       Honourable\n         Supreme Court in the case of Bharat Aluminium\n         Company     V/s          Kaiser     Aluminum               Technical              Services\n         Inc.,    reported in (2012)9 SCC 552.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">         6.5. Learned counsel Mr. Thakore for the defendant\n         thereafter submitted that defendant no.1-vessel\n         has arrived at Alang for breaking purpose. The\n         defendant vessel is not a navigable vessel and\n         therefore       Admiralty              Jurisdiction                  would          not          be\n         available to the plaintiff.

Plaintiff             has     suppressed                the       fact         that\n         vessel    is      already        agreed              to      be      sold         to      NKD\n         Maritime       and        it    has       further             entered             into         a\n         Memorandum        of       Agreement             with        Shree         Ram        Steel\n         Rolling Mills (Unit 2). The vessel arrived at\n         Alang     Anchorage.            The        customs              department                had\n         arranged for rummaging. On 05.10.2015, the agent\n         had applied to the customs authorities as well as\n         sought permission of port authority to beach the\n         vessel    and       filed       cargo        declaration                  before          the\n         customs authorities. The vessel is ready to beach\n         and on account of filing of present suit, the\n         same is pending before the authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">         6.7. Learned counsel Mr.Thakore further contended\n         that the dispute raised by the plaintiff does not\n         fall in any of the ship arrest conventions. The\n         claim    of     the       plaintiff              cannot          be      treated               as\n         maritime lien or maritime claim. The suit for\n         damages will not be maintainable in the admiralty\n         jurisdiction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">         6.8. It is further contended by learned counsel\n         Mr. Thakore that the plaintiff is relying upon\n         the agreement dated 4th October 2011 and present\n         suit is filed in October, 2015 for enforcement of\n         the said agreement. Thus, the suit is time barred\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                              Page 14 of 49</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                    Page 14 of 49       Created On Tue Nov 03 00:34:11 IST 2015\n                    O/AS/34/2015                                                   ORDER\n\n\n\n         and    therefore           the        same           is      required              to          be\n         dismissed. Learned counsel Mr.Thakore thereafter\n         contended that corporate veil cannot be pierced\n         or    lifted      in      the    facts           of       the      present            case.\n         Learned senior counsel Mr.Mihir Thakore further\n         contended       that       when        four          different             agreements\n         were     entered          into       on      4.10.2011                between             the\n         plaintiff and defendant no.2, it can be said that\n         the sale of the vessel was concluded. Learned\n         counsel referred to the Sellers Credit Agreement\n         and    submitted          that     sale          was       completed              because\n         part     payment          was    made         and         credit           was        given\n         partly.        Vessel            was          mortgaged,                   therefore,\n         transaction          of     sale        was          complete.             Thus,          the\n         dispute is not in respect of sale of the vessel\n         as     contended           by    learned                advocate              for         the\n         plaintiff.

It is\n         further submitted that Sellers Credit Agreement\n         is a loan agreement and dispute is arising out of\n         the    loan     agreement          and       therefore               said         dispute\n         cannot    be      termed        as      maritime             claim.

The true legal position in regard tot\n            eh character of a corporation or a company\n            which    owes   its  incorporation   to   a\n            statutory authority, is not in doubt or\n            dispute. The Corporation in law is equal\n            to a natural person and has a legal entity\n            of its own. The entity of the Corporation\n            is entirely separate from that of its\n            shareholders; it bears its own name and\n            has a seal of its own; its assets are\n            separate and distinct from those of its\n            members;    it   can  sue   and   be   sued\n            exclusively for its own purpose; its\n            creditors cannot obtain satisfaction from\n            the assets of its members; the liability\n            of the members or shareholders is limited\n            to    the   capital   invested   by   them;\n            similarly, the creditors of the members\n            have no right to the assets of the\n            Corporation. This position has been well\n            established ever since the decision in the\n            case of Salomon v. Salomon and Co. was\n            pronounced in 1897; and indeed, it has\n            always been the well-recognised principle\n            of common law. However, in the course of\n            time, the doctrine that the Corporation or\n            a Company has a legal and separate entity\n            of its own has been subjected to certain\n            exceptions by the application of the\n            fiction that the veil of the Corporation\n            can be lifted and its face examined in\n            substance. The doctrine of the lifting of\n            the veil thus marks a change in the\n            attitude that law had originally adopted\n            towards the concept of the separate entity\n            or personality of the Corporation. As a\n            result of the impact of the complexity of\n            economic factors, judicial decisions have\n            sometimes recognised exceptions to the\n            rule about the juristic personality of the\n            corporation. It may be that in course of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                 Page 21 of 49</span>\n\nHC-NIC                         Page 21 of 49     Created On Tue Nov 03 00:34:11 IST 2015\n                 O/AS/34/2015                                               ORDER\n\n\n\n            time these exceptions may grow in number\n            and to meet the requirements of different\n            economic problems, the theory about the\n            personality of the corporation may be\n            confined more and more.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">         7.5.

It cannot be\n            disputed that, in law, a company is a\n            legal entity distinct from its members. It\n            was so laid down by the House of Lords in\n            1897 in the leading case of Salomon v.\n            Salomon &amp; Co.8 Ever since this decision\n            has been followed by the courts in England\n            as well as in this country. But there have\n            been inroads in the doctrine of corporate\n            personality    propounded   in  the    said\n            decision by statutory provisions as well\n            as by judicial pronouncements. By the\n            process, commonly described as &quot;lifting\n            the veil&quot;, the law either goes behind the\n            corporate personality to the individual\n            members    or     ignores   the    separate\n            personality of each company in favour of\n            the economic entity constituted by a group\n            of associated companies. This course is\n            adopted   when   it   is  found  that   the\n            principle of corporate personality is too\n            flagrantly opposed to justice, convenience\n            or the interest of the Revenue.

This means that both\n         the conditions are to be observed while\n         applying the Convention of 1999.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">         16.  The aforesaid leads us to examine the\n         question as to whether the contract in\n         question is involving public law character\n         or not. The contract in question for sale\n         of the particular ship is produced by the\n         plaintiffs themselves with the plaint at\n         Annexure-A and the same is entered into\n         between the plaintiffs and defendant No.3\n         herein.    It   is    purely    a    commercial\n         transaction for sale of the ship and, in\n         no way, connected with our nation directly\n         or indirectly, nor is there any operation\n         and/or involvement of the State or any\n         instrumentality    of   the    State    as   per\n         <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.\n         The said contract dated 21.8.2008, upon\n         which the reliance has been placed by the\n         plaintiff, in our view would not attract\n         any public law character, in any manner,\n         whatsoever. In our view, the parameters of\n         the    contract    involving       public    law\n         character has to be read as per the legal\n         provisions prevailing in our country. It\n         is by now well settled that the contract\n         may attract public law character, if the\n         State or instrumentality of the State, is\n         directly or indirectly connected therewith\n         in   enforcement    of    the     contract    or\n         implementation thereof. Further, by virtue\n         of the said contract, if there is any\n         question arises for the sovereignty of the\n         Nation, environment, pollution, dispute of\n         sea water etc., where larger or huge or\n         any public interest is involved, such\n         contract may also attract public law\n         character. We do not find any element of\n         public   law   character    in    the    present\n         contract in question even if the terms and\n         conditions of the contract agreement are\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                Page 39 of 49</span>\n\nHC-NIC                        Page 39 of 49     Created On Tue Nov 03 00:34:11 IST 2015\n             O/AS/34/2015                                         ORDER\n\n\n\n         considered as they were.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">         17. On the second aspect of domestic law\n         enacted by the Parliament, if considered,\n         provisions <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_42\">of CPC</a> would be required to be\n         followed, even if one has to enforce the\n         Convention of 1999. The order of arrest of\n         the ship may fall at par with the\n         provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_43\">Order 38 Rule 5 of the CPC</a>,\n         providing for attachment before judgement\n         or, in any case, the principles analogues\n         thereto. <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_44\">Order 38 Rule 5 of CPC</a> would be\n         attracted only when the defendant is to\n         defeat the realization of the decree that\n         may be passed against him. It would\n         presuppose the prayer in the suit for\n         realization   of  any   amount  through  a\n         decree, whose execution is sought to be\n         frustrated by the defendant.

Thus,         in      view         of         the         aforesaid                two\n         conventions of 1952 as well as 1999 as well as\n         aforesaid binding decision of this Court, this\n         Court is of the opinion that in the present case\n         the    dispute          between        the        plaintiff               and        even\n         defendant No.2 is with regard to contract of sale\n         of the vessel. The agreements are produced on\n         record. From reading the contents of the said\n         agreements, it can be said that it is purely a\n         commercial transaction for sale of the vessel and\n         in no way connected with our nation directly or\n         indirectly;        nor     is    there            any     operation              and/or\n         involvement of the State or any instrumentality\n         of    the     State        as      per          <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_51\">Article             12</a>        of       the\n         Constitution of India. Moreover, the agreements\n         which are executed on 04.10.2011 and relied upon\n         by the plaintiff and produced at Exh.A to D with\n         the compilation, in the opinion of this Court,\n         would not attract any public law character in any\n         manner whatsoever. As per the aforesaid binding\n         decision of this Court, the parameters of the\n         contract involving public law character has to be\n         read as per the legal provisions prevailing in\n         our country. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1147125\" id=\"span_55\">The contract may attract public law\n         character, if the State or instrumentality of the\n         State,      is      directly          or          indirectly              connected\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                           Page 42 of 49</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                   Page 42 of 49     Created On Tue Nov 03 00:34:11 IST 2015\n                      O/AS/34/2015                                                    ORDER\n\n\n\n         therewith          in       enforcement                 of     the        contract                or\n         implementation                  thereof.       Moreover,               by      virtue             of\n         the said contract if there is any question arises\n         for the sovereignty of the nation, environment,\n         pollution,          dispute            of     sea        waters           etc.,          where\n         larger       or       huge         or       any         public           interest                 is\n         involved, such contract may also attract public\n         law character. In the present case, the element\n         of    public        law         character           in       the      agreements                  in\n         question is missing. Thus, even if the convention\n         of 1999 is applicable, but for the fact that the\n         agreements relied upon by the plaintiff do not\n         involve any public law character, the aforesaid\n         condition <a href=\"/doc/1147125/\" id=\"a_52\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n         in    the     case          of    <a href=\"/doc/1147125/\" id=\"a_53\">Liverpool             &amp;     London           S.P.        &amp;      I\n         Association Ltd.</a> (supra) and the Hon&#x27;ble Division\n         Bench of this Court in the case of Croft Sales\n         and Distribution Ltd.
