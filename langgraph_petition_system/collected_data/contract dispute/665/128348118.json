On   the   basis   of   these\n                documents, the Tribunal has held that payments were\n                being   directly   made   to   workers   when   they   were\n                contract labours.

In   this   case,   the   Industrial\n      \n\n                   Court answered both questions in the affirmative and\n                   as a consequence held that first respondent is a direct\n   \n\n\n\n                   employee of the appellant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">         9.

In regard to the first test as\n\n\n\n\n\n                   to who pays the salary, it placed the onus wrongly\n                   upon the appellant. It is for the employee to aver and\n                   prove that he was paid salary directly by the principal\n                   employer and not the contractor. The first respondent\n                   did not discharge this onus. Even in regard to second\n\n\n\n\n\n                   test,   the   employee   did   not   establish   that   he   was\n                   working under the direct control and supervision of\n                   the   principal   employer.
