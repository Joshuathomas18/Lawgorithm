The factual background of the case as stated in the writ petition is\n    that the respondent-CIL pursuant to the guidelines issued by the\n    Government of India, through Ministry of Coal dated 15.10.2015\n    formed a scheme popularly known as &quot;Special Forward e-auction\n    Scheme for Power Producer (in short &#x27;the Scheme&#x27;) and the same\n    was adopted by the respondent-CCL. The respondent-CCL\n    published notice dated 21.07.2016 inviting auction for supply 380\n    rakes of Coal from North Karanpura Colliery having its railways\n    siding being &quot;KD Old Siding&quot; of G-10 Grade of Coal (subsequently\n    increased to 610 rakes of coal) to Power Producer under the\n    Scheme, termed as e-auction Phase-III pertaining to supply of coal\n    from the month of August 2016 to January 2017 for which the\n    validity period of lifting of Coal against the successful quantity was\n    prescribed as 12 months i.e from August 2016 to July 2017.The\n    petitioner participated and was declared successful in the auction\n    and was allotted 350 Rakes of coal to be supplied by the CCL. The\n    petitioner submitted its schedule of monthly quantity of coal which\n    it intended to lift within the identified period of 12 months. The\n    petitioner made payment for 39 rakes of coal in the month of April,\n    2017 and it was supplied 21 rakes of coal in the said month. In the\n    month of May, 2017, the petitioner deposited payment for 43 rakes\n    of coal, however, it was supplied 25 rakes of coal in that month.\n    In the month of June, 2017, the petitioner deposited payment for\n    23 rakes of coal however it was supplied 17 rakes of coal in that\n    month. In the month of July 2017, the petitioner deposited\n    payment for 20 rakes of coal and it was supplied 22 rakes of coal.\n    Thus, the total rakes of coal supplied to the petitioner were 85\n    rakes against the deposit of coal value of 125 rakes. The CCL\n    issued a general notice dated 17.07.2017 to the successful bidders\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                4</span>\n\n\n\n\n   under e-auction Phase-III directing them to deposit the payment\n   for the coal value till 31.07.2017 or else it was stated, inter alia,\n   that action would be initiated as per terms and conditions of the\n   said scheme. The petitioner, thereafter, filed a representation\n   before the respondent authorities on 19.07.2017 and 24.07.2017\n   as well as the representation dated 28.08.2017 requesting them\n   to extend the validity period for lifting of coal for Phase-III auction\n   till March, 2018, however, the respondent-CCL proceeded to forfeit\n   the EMD of Rs.9,72,00,000/- deposited by the petitioner in respect\n   of balance 225 rakes of coal on the ground that the petitioner has\n   not deposited 100% coal value of the said rakes of coal within the\n   stipulated time i.e till 31.07.2017.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5. The learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the impugned\n   action of the respondent-CCL on the following grounds:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">   (a)    The impugned order has been passed in violation of\n          principles of natural justice as neither any notice to show\n          cause was issued nor any opportunity of hearing was given\n          to it before passing of the order of forfeiture of EMD. In\n          fact, the petitioner has come to know the fact of forfeiture\n          of EMD only through the counter affidavit of the\n          respondent-CCL filed in another writ petition being W.C No.\n          4426 of 2017.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">   (b)    E-auction Phase-III was not only invited by the CCL alone\n          but also by the other subsidiary of Coal India Limited (in\n          short &#x27;CIL&#x27;) and similar problem of delay in supply coal had\n          occurred and under the said circumstance, the CIL extended\n          the validity of the scheme in respect of other subsidiaries\n          including South East Coal Fields Ltd and Western Coalfields\n          Ltd.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">   (c)    The respondent -CCL in most arbitrary manner and actuated\n          by malice in law has failed to extend the validity period of\n          e-auction Phase-III despite the fact that due to the reasons\n          attributable    to       the   respondent-authorities   of   CCL\n          themselves, loading of coal pursuant to e-auction Phase-III\n          could not commence within the stipulated time which\n          commenced only after a delay of 8 months i.e from April,\n          2017.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                         5</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(d)   The respondent-CCL instead of making recommendation for\n      extension of the validity period of e-auction Phase-III, has\n      proceeded to forfeit the EMD/Security Deposit of the\n      petitioner for the balance of 225 rakes of coal on the alleged\n      pretext that the petitioner has not deposited 100% coal\n      value of the said rakes of coal. The said action pertaining to\n      forfeiture of the EMD of the petitioner is wholly arbitrary,\n      unreasonable, whimsical and contrary to clause 14.3 of the\n      Scheme.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(e)   After allotment of coal, the petitioner had submitted the\n      monthly scheduled quantity of supply of coal on month wise\n      basis commencing from October, 2016 and the same was\n      duly approved by the CCL. However, due to non-availability\n      of coal at K.D Old Siding from which coal was to be supplied\n      to the petitioner, there was no commencement of supply\n      from the said siding for e-auction Phase-III and as such the\n      petitioner filed representations dated 23.10.2016 and\n      21/22.11.2016 before the respondents-CCL and CIL\n      requesting therein for extending the validity period of lifting\n      of coal from July, 2017 to January, 2018 assuming that the\n      supply of coal from the K.D Old Siding would commence at\n      least from January, 2017.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(f)   In-spite of the repeated request of the petitioner, neither\n      the validity period of lifting of coal of e-auction Phase III\n      was extended by the respondent-CCL nor it took steps to\n      expedite the supply of coal. The petitioner was compelled\n      to revise its monthly schedule of coal and ultimately vide its\n      letter dated 31.01.2017, requested the CCL to supply the\n      successful bid quantity of coal to the petitioner commencing\n      from March, 2017.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(g)   Immediately when the first loading was started from the\n      month of April, 2017, the petitioner filed representation\n      dated 18.04.2017 before the respondent-CCL/CIL and\n      requested for extending of the validity period of lifting of\n      coal and payment schedule from July, 2017 to March, 2018\n      stating that there is an abnormal delay of 8 months in\n      supply of coal pursuant to e-auction Phase-III, however, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                              6</span>\n\n\n\n\n          respondents did not pay any heed to the representation of\n          the petitioner in spite of noting in file made by the Deputy\n          Manager (M &amp; S Oprn.) of CCL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">   (h)    From April, 2017 to July, 2017, the petitioner deposited the\n          coal value of 125 rakes, however the respondent-CCL\n          supplied only 85 rakes of coal and as such they could not\n          supply the balance 40 rakes of coal till the validity period.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">   (i)    The respondent-CCL is trying to unjustly enrich itself with\n          the money of the consumers compelling them to deposit the\n          entire coal value with the threat of forfeiture of earnest\n          money deposit and is consequentially not supplying the coal\n          within the stipulated time to the said consumers and is\n          enjoying interest over the money deposited by the\n          consumers for an indefinite period.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">   (j)    Approximately Rs.42 crores and Rs.9 crores respectively\n          have been deposited by CESC Limited and Prayag Raj Power\n          Limited before 31.07.2017 and the entire Rs.51 crores is\n          lying with the CCL and not even a single rake of coal has\n          been supplied to the said entities in spite of deposit of Rs.51\n          crores with the CCL, which shows the mala fide act of the\n          CCL.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">   (k)    If the petitioner had deposited Rs.180 crores approx. on or\n          before 31.07.2017 being the amount towards 100% value\n          of 225 rakes of coal, it would, like other consumers be still\n          waiting for supply of coal by the CCL and its entire money\n          of Rs.180 crores would have been blocked with the CCL.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner\n   that the delay in supply of coal was made by the respondent-CCL\n   owing to several factors and reasons solely attributable to CCL\n   which are detailed as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">   (a)    Mines from which the coal is extracted by the respondent-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">          CCL is situated at some distance from its railways siding and\n          the coal is to be transported from the mining area to the\n          railways siding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">   (b)    CCL had not taken preparatory steps for ensuring\n          availability of coal at railways siding and the tenders were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                            7</span>\n\n\n\n\n          invited for transportation of coal for making the same\n          available at the railways siding after much delay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">   (c)    Even the Grade of coal for which the auction was conducted\n          was not available in the mining area of CCL which is evident\n          from the fact that the petitioner was declared successful\n          bidder for G-10 Grade of Coal but the CCL as late as on\n          22.04.2017, requested the petitioner to give consent for\n          lifting of lessor Grade of Coal i.e G-11 Grade which was also\n          accepted by the petitioner vide letter dated 04.05.2017.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">   (d)    The CCL has discriminated amongst the auction bidders\n          while supplying the coal available at the railways siding and\n          has given priority to supply coal to National Thermal Power\n          Corporation ignoring the schedule of supply of coal to the\n          petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">   (e)    The CCL, prior to e-auction Phase-III, had invited e-auction\n          Phase-II in which the coal was to be supplied in the month\n          of June and July, 2016 with an outer limit for supply of coal\n          till December, 2016. The supply of coal under e-auction\n          Phase-II which was to be completed by December, 2016\n          was completed only in the month of March, 2017. Under e-\n          auction Phase-II, the coal was also to be supplied from K.D\n          Old Siding which was also identified for supply of coal in e-\n          auction Phase-III.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">   (f)    Since admittedly there was delay in supply of coal for e-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">          auction Phase-II, the last date of payment of coal value for\n          e-auction Phase-II which was initially till 31.12.2016, was\n          extended till 10.03.2017 vide letter dated 27.02.2017.\n          Moreover, the time was further extended for deposit of\n          payment of coal value up to 10.04.2017 in e-auction phase-\n          II in respect of K.D Old Siding. Mere fact that extension of\n          time was granted for e-auction phase-II by CCL, itself\n          clearly demonstrates that e-auction phase-II was delayed\n          which has, in result, delayed commencement of supply of\n          coal in respect of e-auction phase-III.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">7.

Per Contra the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\n   respondent-CCL has advanced the following argument:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">   (a)     Since very inception the petitioner had not been regular in\n           depositing the coal value though it was allotted 350 rakes\n           of coal which was to be lifted by it between August, 2016\n           to July, 2017. As per the monthly scheduled quantity (in\n           short &#x27;MSQ&#x27;) submitted by the petitioner vide letter dated\n           21.10.2016, it sought no rakes in the months of October,\n           2016 and November, 2016. Further, vide letter dated\n           21.10.2016 it revised the MSQ and sought no rakes in first\n           four months and vide letter dated 27.11.2016, it revised the\n           MSQ and sought no rakes till December 2016. Lastly, vide\n           letter dated 31.01.2017, the petitioner revised the MSQ by\n           declaring that it required no rakes till February 2017. Thus\n           the petitioner itself opted to receive &#x27;NIL&#x27; supply for seven\n           months.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">   (b)     The supply of coal could have commenced only if the\n           petitioner had deposited the value of coal. The petitioner\n           for the first time deposited the value of coal in February,\n           2017 and therefore naturally for the said value, the supply\n           of coal commenced in March, 2017 and as such there was\n           no delay on the part of the respondent-CCL in making\n           supply of coal, rather the delay was on the part of the\n           petitioner in depositing the value of coal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">   (c)     The petitioner in place of 350 rakes of coal bided by it, could\n           deposit the value of only 125 rakes and as and when the\n           rakes were placed by the transporter i.e. the Railways, the\n           coal was supplied to it. In consequence of the deposition of\n           coal value by the petitioner, the respondent-CCL effected\n           consequential sanction leading to allotment of rakes. The\n           petitioner committed default in depositing 100% of the coal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                         9</span>\n\n\n\n\n      value and by committing such default, it has made itself\n      liable to face consequences provided under the scheme and\n      thus such consequential cannot be said to be suffering from\n      any illegality whatsoever.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">(d)   As per applicable modalities of Special Forward e-auction\n      for 2016-17 for Power Producers-Phase-III, in the context\n      of supply by rail mode, the stipulation is &quot;supply will be\n      made as per extant rules of Railways&quot;. The action taken by\n      the CCL is in complete conformity with the requirement of\n      the scheme. Clause 11.2.3 of the Scheme stipulates that\n      once the rake is allotted, it would remain valid for supply of\n      coal as per prevailing Railways Rules, thus the allotment of\n      rakes had non lapsable character. After the rakes are\n      placed, information is given by the Railways which is duly\n      entered in a register maintained for the purpose and the\n      register would show that within few hours of placement of\n      rakes, coal has been supplied. The petitioner has nowhere\n      mentioned as to on which date it had booked the rakes by\n      depositing the requisite fees to the Railways. Coal has\n      always been available at the stockyard of the concerned\n      mines and as and when the rakes of a particular customer\n      are placed, the coal is loaded on it. In cases of\n      transportation by road, the responsibility is of the customer\n      to lift the coal within the validity period of auction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">(e)   Clause 14.3 of the Scheme applies wherein there has been\n      deposition of the coal value for the MSQ and the successful\n      bidder is willing to lift the quantity, yet there is failure on\n      the part of the coal company in offering a part or full of the\n      MSQ of the bidder within the stipulated validity period.\n      Clause 14.3 of the Scheme provides no protection to a\n      bidder who fails on the point of deposition of coal value.\n      Concededly, the petitioner failed to deposit of coal value for\n      225 rakes and in that event forfeiture of EMD automatically\n      comes in play in terms of Clause 14.1 of the Scheme.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">(f)   The contention of the petitioner regarding not providing 10\n      days&#x27; show cause notice as per Clause 8.3 of the scheme is\n      liable to be rejected as the requirement of providing 10\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                        10</span>\n\n\n\n\n      days&#x27; notice is applicable in the case of Bank Guarantee\n      which concerns the conversion of EMD into a Security\n      Deposit. However, the present case relates to forfeiture of\n      EMD/BG/Security Deposit and the situation is covered under\n      Clause 14 of the Scheme. It is further contended that the\n      application for extension of time was contrary to the scheme\n      and the last date of deposit of the value of coal was already\n      stipulated as per the scheme which is uniformly applicable\n      to all the participants. In absence of any enabling provision,\n      the petitioner could not have demanded extension of\n      validity period of the contract as well as extension of last\n      date of depositing the coal value. The petitioner at the time\n      of participation in the contract was aware of the period\n      during which it was required to deposit the coal value and\n      having full knowledge of the said fact, it participated in the\n      e-auction Phase-III and undertook to deposit the value of\n      coal bidded by it by 31st July, 2017 and in support of its\n      commitment, it deposited the security money which in the\n      event of such failure, automatically became liable to be\n      forfeited and thus the same has rightly been forfeited by\n      the respondent-CCL. It is also contended that for e-auction\n      Phase III, the petitioner is the sole defaulter as all other\n      successful bidders have effected total deposition of the coal\n      value prior to the cut-off date i.e. 31.07.2017. Any\n      extension in such a situation would amount to bestowing\n      indulgence on a single entity. Such a course is antithetical\n      to the scheme and declared precedential law. It deserves to\n      be significantly noticed that Clause 16.9 of the Scheme\n      expressly stipulates that CIL/Coal Company reserves its\n      rights to amend/modify the terms and conditions contained\n      therein in full or in part at any point of time and no party\n      shall have any right whatsoever to raise any claim on that\n      count.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">(g)   The petitioner has not taken recourse to the effective,\n      efficacious mechanism of dispute resolution by way of\n      arbitration as per clause 17 of Special Forward e-auction\n      scheme for Power Producers 2016-17 Phase-III.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                        11</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">(h)   The coal was to be lifted by the petitioner through rail mode\n      from KD Old siding. The feeder mines of KD Old Siding are\n      Ashoka Project and Piparwar Project. There was sufficient\n      quantity of coal available in the stock of both the mines and,\n      thus, had the petitioner deposited requisite value of coal,\n      the same would have definitely been delivered to it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">(i)   The delay in commencing the supply of coal occurred due\n      to delay on the part of the petitioner in depositing the value\n      of coal which under the scheme is required to be deposited\n      in advance. So far as the allegation of the petitioner that\n      the respondent-CCL delayed even in supplying 125 rakes of\n      coal for which entire payment was made, the said delay is\n      not on the part of the respondent-CCL as for supply of coal\n      through rail mode, the loading of coal can be effected only\n      when the wagons are placed at the respective sidings.\n      Perusal of the register annexed by the respondent-CCL with\n      the counter affidavit would show that as and when the rakes\n      were placed by the railways, the loading was made. Had the\n      petitioner deposited the value of coal of entire 350 rakes,\n      the supply would have definitely been made by it as there\n      was sufficient quantity of coal available in the stockyard of\n      the respective mines from where supply was to be made.\n      In the e-auction, only such quantity of coal is put on auction\n      and is allocated which is available with the coal company\n      and therefore the allegation of the petitioner is baseless and\n      misleading.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">(j)   The petitioner had been given an option to accept G-11\n      Grade coal if the same suited it, to which the petitioner\n      agreed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">(k)   The CCL has never recommended for extension of time\n      rather a Deputy Manager posted in the Headquarters\n      prepared a note-sheet on the representation of the\n      petitioner which does not create any right in favour of the\n      petitioner. Facts in the note sheet were not found to be in\n      consonance with the actual facts, rather it was found that\n      the petitioner has failed to deposit the value of coal and\n      therefore question of extension does not arise.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                              12</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">   (l)     The validity period of deposit of coal value under the special\n           forward e-auction scheme, Phase-II 2016-17 has been\n           extended at the instance of CIL due to difficulty faced by all\n           the customers in depositing the coal value due to\n           demonetization enforced by the Central Government during\n           the relevant period. The same being a policy decision of the\n           CIL was uniformly made applicable to all the customers\n           under the said e-auction scheme.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">9. The respondent-CCL by way of an affidavit dated 12.02.2018 has\n   replied to the counter affidavit of the Railways. It has been stated\n   inter alia that the coal companies enter the details of the\n   customers, the destination and number of rakes sanctioned and\n   make     request   for     allotment   of   rakes   in   the   website\n   www.fois.indianrail.gov.in on the Railways. Based on the entries\n   made by the coal companies and on receipt of payment by the\n   customers for booking of coal against transportation by rail mode,\n   the Railways as per availability of the rakes, make allotment of\n   rakes in terms with the extant rules. The supply of rakes is as per\n   the convenience of the Railways and the Coal Companies have no\n   role in the same. Moreover, depending upon the constraints of\n   traffic movement on existing railways tracks, the rakes are allowed\n   to move in limited number to various destinations which is decided\n   by the railways authorities independently.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">10.

Learned counsel for the respondent-Railways submits that the\n   Railways have no information regarding availability of the coal at\n   the loading point and are also not required to have any such\n   information. The rakes are supplied by Railways as per their own\n   availability of rakes and this issue is in the realm of functioning\n   between the petitioner and the Railways. The only assigned role\n   to the coal company is to indicate the Railways about the allocation\n   of coal in favour of the bidder fulfilling the financial requirement in\n   that behalf. Thereafter, the issue is between the bidder and the\n   Railways. The role of the coal company thereafter starts with the\n   availability of the rakes at the loading point. If any delay is caused,\n   the coal company is liable for demurrage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">12. The learned counsel for the respondent-Railways further submits\n   that for the purpose of dispatch of coal from railways siding to\n   different consumers, necessary monthly programme is sanctioned\n   by the Railways against online programme submitted by the\n   consumers and based on the sanctioned programme, a day to day\n   demand is registered by the coal company on the official website\n   of Railways for day to day allotment of rakes for loading of coal.\n   The coal companies furnish daily, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly\n   loading potential of each colliery siding. Day to day planning of\n   supply of allocated rakes for loading of coal from colliery siding is\n   being planned by Railways in coordination with the coal companies\n   considering the daily potential furnished by the coal companies.\n   Supply of rakes for day to day loading is being made available by\n   the Railways on the basis of availability of coal at the loading point\n   and available coal stock of different power houses. The consumer\n   has no role in planning the day to day supply of rakes for loading.\n   Railways has allotted rakes for loading of coal in favour of the\n   petitioner pursuant to sanction of the necessary programme\n   between the periods 11.04.2017 to 21.07.2017.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                            14</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">13. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials\n   available on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">14. The respondent-CCL invited an auction for supply of coal under\n   Special Forward e-auction Scheme termed as e-auction Phase-III\n   pertaining to supply of coal for the period from August 2016 to\n   January 2017. The petitioner participated in the auction and was\n   allotted 350 Rakes of coal to be supplied by the CCL within the\n   identified period of 12 months. Admittedly, till March, 2017, the\n   petitioner did not make any payment for supply of coal and only in\n   the month of April, 2017 it made payment for 39 rakes of coal\n   against which it was supplied 21 rakes of coal. In the month of\n   May, 2017, it deposited payment for 43 rakes of coal, however, it\n   was supplied 25 rakes of coal. In the month of June, 2017, it\n   deposited payment for 23 rakes, however, it was supplied 17 rakes\n   of coal and in the month of July 2017, it deposited payment for 20\n   rakes of coal for which it was supplied 22 rakes of coal. Thus, total\n   coal supplied to the petitioner was 85 rakes against the payment\n   of coal value of 125 rakes. The CCL issued a general notice dated\n   17.07.2017 to the successful bidders under e-auction Phase-III\n   informing them to deposit the coal value till 31.07.2017 or else it\n   was mentioned that appropriate action would be initiated as per\n   terms and condition of the scheme. However the petitioner did not\n   deposit the total coal value in pursuance of the general notice and\n   as such the CCL forfeited the Earnest Money Deposit/Security\n   Deposit of the petitioner in respect of 225 rakes of coal amounting\n   to Rs.9,72,00,000/- which gives rise to filing of present writ\n   petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">15. The learned counsel for the respondent has raised preliminary\n   objection to the maintainability of the present writ petitioner by\n   stating that the issue involve in the present writ petition is\n   contractual dispute and the alternative remedy is available to the\n   petitioner   by    invoking   the    arbitration   clause   of   the\n   scheme/contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">16. Thus, before coming to the merit of the case, it would be\n   appropriate to go through the judicial pronouncements of the\n   Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, whereby the principles have been laid\n   down to deal with the matters involving contractual dispute under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                          15</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_23\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_10\">ABL\nInternational Ltd. v.

Ordinarily, the remedy available for a party complaining\n         of breach of contract lies for seeking damages. He will be\n         entitled to the relief of specific performance, if the contract is\n         capable of being specifically enforced in law. The remedies for\n         a breach of contract being purely in the realm of contract are\n         dealt with by civil courts. The public law remedy, by way of a\n         writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is\n         not available to seek damages for breach of contract or specific\n         performance of contract. However, where the contractual\n         dispute has a public law element, the power of judicial review\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India may be invoked.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">         23. If the dispute was considered as purely one relating to\n         existence of an agreement, that is, whether there was a\n         concluded contract and whether the cancellation and\n         consequential non-supply amounted to breach of such\n         contract, the first respondent ought to have approached the\n         civil court for damages. On the other hand, when a writ petition\n         was filed in regard to the said contractual dispute, the issue\n         was whether the Secretary (Sugar), had acted arbitrarily or\n         unreasonably in staying the operation of the allotment letter\n         dated 26-3-2004 or subsequently cancelling the allotment\n         letter. In a civil suit, the emphasis is on the contractual right.\n         In a writ petition, the focus shifts to the exercise of power by\n         the authority, that is, whether the order of cancellation dated\n         24-4-2004 passed by the Secretary (Sugar), was arbitrary or\n         unreasonable. The issue whether there was a concluded\n         contract and breach thereof becomes secondary. In exercising\n         writ jurisdiction, if the High Court found that the exercise of\n         power in passing an order of cancellation was not arbitrary and\n         unreasonable, it should normally desist from giving any finding\n         on disputed or complicated questions of fact as to whether\n         there was a contract, and relegate the petitioner to the remedy\n         of a civil suit. Even in cases where the High Court finds that\n         there is a valid contract, if the impugned administrative action\n         by which the contract is cancelled, is not unreasonable or\n         arbitrary, it should still refuse to interfere with the same,\n         leaving the aggrieved party to work out his remedies in a civil\n         court. In other words, when there is a contractual dispute with\n         a public law element, and a party chooses the public law\n         remedy by way of a writ petition instead of a private law\n         remedy of a suit, he will not get a full-fledged adjudication of\n         his contractual rights, but only a judicial review of the\n         administrative action. The question whether there was a\n         contract and whether there was a breach may, however, be\n         examined incidentally while considering the reasonableness of\n         the administrative action. But where the question whether\n         there was a contract, is seriously disputed, the High Court\n         cannot assume that there was a valid contract and on that\n         basis, examine the validity of the administrative action.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                          17</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"784921\" id=\"span_31\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/784921/\" id=\"a_25\">Air India Statutory Corpn. v.

Every matter in which\n   some public law element is involved and the State or its\n   instrumentality has dealt with any private party, the State\n   functionaries are expected to act in a fair and reasonable manner.\n   If from the fact of a case, it appears to the writ court that any\n   authority of the State or its instrumentality has not acted in fair,\n   just and equitable manner, an appropriate relief may be granted\n   to the aggrieved party.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                             19</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">18.

A party cannot claim anything more than what is covered\n            by the terms of contract, for the reason that contract is a\n            transaction between the two parties and has been entered into\n            with open eyes and understanding the nature of contract.\n            Thus, contract being a creature of an agreement between two\n            or more parties, has to be interpreted giving literal meanings\n            unless, there is some ambiguity therein. The contract is to be\n            interpreted giving the actual meaning to the words contained\n            in the contract and it is not permissible for the court to make a\n            new contract, however is reasonable, if the parties have not\n            made it themselves. It is to be interpreted in such a way that\n            its terms may not be varied. The contract has to be interpreted\n            without giving any outside aid. The terms of the contract have\n            to be construed strictly without altering the nature of the\n            contract, as it may affect the interest of either of the parties\n            adversely.

It is evident from the above, that generally the court should\n            not exercise its writ jurisdiction to enforce the contractual\n            obligation. The primary purpose of a writ of mandamus, is to\n            protect and establish rights and to impose a corresponding\n            imperative duty existing in law. It is designed to promote\n            justice (ex debitojusticeiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is\n            at the discretion of the court. The writ cannot be granted\n            unless it is established that there is an existing legal right of\n            the applicant, or an existing duty of the respondent. Thus, the\n            writ does not lie to create or to establish a legal right, but to\n            enforce one that is already established. While dealing with a\n            writ petition, the court must exercise discretion, taking into\n            consideration a wide variety of circumstances, inter-alia, the\n            facts of the case, the exigency that warrants such exercise of\n            discretion, the consequences of grant or refusal of the writ,\n            and the nature and extent of injury that is likely to ensue by\n            such grant or refusal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">            22. Hence, discretion must be exercised by the court on\n            grounds of public policy, public interest and public good. The\n            writ is equitable in nature and thus, its issuance is governed by\n            equitable principles. Refusal of relief must be for reasons\n            which would lead to injustice. The prime consideration for the\n            issuance of the said writ is, whether or not substantial justice\n            will be promoted. Furthermore, while granting such a writ, the\n            court must make every effort to ensure from the averments of\n            the writ petition, whether there exist proper pleadings. In\n            order to maintain the writ of mandamus, the first and foremost\n            requirement is that the petition must not be frivolous, and\n            must be filed in good faith. Additionally, the applicant must\n            make a demand which is clear, plain and unambiguous. It must\n            be made to an officer having the requisite authority to perform\n            the act demanded.

It was not disputed and in fairness to Mr Bhatt, it\n         must be said that he did not dispute that the Corporation which\n         is set up under Section 3 of the State Financial Corporation Act,\n         1955 is an instrumentality of the State and would be &quot;other\n         authority&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution. By its letter of\n         offer dated July 24, 1978 and the subsequent agreement dated\n         February 1, 1979 the appellant entered into a solemn\n         agreement in performance of its statutory duty to advance the\n         loan of Rs 30 lakhs to the respondent. Acting on the solemn\n         undertaking, the respondent proceeded to undertake and\n         execute the project of setting up a 4-star hotel at Baroda. The\n         agreement to advance the loan was entered into in\n         performance of the statutory duty cast on the Corporation by\n         the statute under which it was created and set up. On its\n         solemn promise evidenced by the aforementioned two\n         documents, the respondent incurred expenses, suffered\n         liabilities to set up a hotel. Presumably, if the loan was not\n         forthcoming, the respondent may not have undertaken such a\n         huge project. Acting on the promise of the appellant evidenced\n         by documents, the respondent proceeded to suffer further\n         liabilities to implement and execute the project.

In the aforesaid judgments, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held\n   that a writ should not be issued unless it is established that there\n   is an existing legal right of the petitioner as well as the\n   corresponding duty of the respondent. A writ is equitable in nature\n   and its issuance is governed by the equitable principles. Normally\n   the court should not entertain a writ petition if there is a breach of\n   contract involving disputed questions of fact. If an alternative and\n   equally efficacious remedy is available to the litigant, it should be\n   required to pursue that remedy and not to invoke writ jurisdiction\n   and that would be a good ground in refusing to exercise the\n   discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. Though\n   many matters could be decided by appreciating the affidavits and\n   counter affidavits filed by the parties in a writ proceeding, yet if\n   serious disputed question of facts or rival claims of the parties with\n   regard to breach of contract are required to be determined on the\n   basis of evidence which may be led by the parties in a properly\n   instituted case before efficacious forums, it would not be\n   appropriate for the High Court to exercise prerogative of issuing\n   writs. It has further been <a href=\"/doc/871220/\" id=\"a_63\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court that\n   a party cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the\n   terms of the contract for the reason that the contract is a\n   transaction between two parties and has been entered into with\n   open eyes and understanding the nature of contract.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">20.

The petitioner repeatedly requested the respondent-\n    CCL to extend the time schedule for depositing the coal value but\n    the CCL kept idle. The case of the petitioner is also substantiated\n    by the subsequent act of the respondent-CCL as despite payment\n    for 125 rakes of coal by the petitioner, it could deliver only 85\n    rakes. In support of the contention the learned counsel for the\n    petitioner has brought on record several documents.

It is a settled legal proposition that even if a document is\n              procured by improper or illegal means, there is no bar to its\n              admissibility if it is relevant and its genuineness is proved. If\n              the evidence is admissible, it does not matter how it has been\n              obtained. However, as a matter of caution, the court in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                              24</span>\n\n\n\n\n             exercise of its discretion may disallow certain evidence in a\n             criminal case if the strict rules of admissibility would operate\n             unfairly against the accused. More so, the court must conclude\n             that it is genuine and free from tampering or mutilation. This\n             Court repelled the contention that obtaining evidence illegally\n             by using tape recordings or photographs offends <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_65\">Articles 20(3)</a>\n             and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_66\">21</a> of the Constitution of India as acquiring the evidence\n             by such methods was not the procedure established by law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">23. In the case of R.M. Malkani (Supra.), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n   Court has held as under:-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">             &quot;24.  It was said by counsel for the appellant that the tape\n             recorded conversation was obtained by illegal means. The\n             illegality was said to be contravention of <a href=\"/doc/1034087/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 25</a> of the\n             Indian Telegraph Act. There is no violation of Section 25 of the\n             Telagraph Act in the facts and circumstances of the present\n             case. There is warrant for proposition that even if evidence is\n             illegally obtained it is admissible. Over a century ago it was\n             said in an English case where a constable searched the\n             appellant illegally and found a quantity of offending article in\n             his pocket that it would be a dangerous obstacle to the\n             administration of justice if it were held, because evidence was\n             obtained by illegal means, it could not be used against a party\n             charged with an offence. See Jones v. Owen. The Judicial\n             Committee in Kuruma, Son of Kanju v. R. dealt with the\n             conviction of an accused of being in unlawful possession of\n             ammunition which had been discovered in consequence of a\n             search of his person by a police officer below the rank of those\n             who were permitted to make such searches. The Judicial\n             Committee held that the evidence was rightly admitted. The\n             reason given was that if evidence was admissible it matters not\n             how it was obtained. There is of course always a word of\n             caution. It is that the Judge has a discretion to disallow\n             evidence in a criminal case if the strict rules of admissibility\n             would operate unfairly against the accused. That caution is the\n             golden rule in criminal jurisprudence.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">24. In the case of Madhu v.

However, the respondent-CCL has challenged the admissibility of\n   the said note sheet in the present case contending that it is an\n   internal document of the company which has been procured by\n   the petitioner through illegal means. The contention of the learned\n   senior counsel for the respondent-CCL is that the note sheet which\n   has been heavily relied upon by the petitioner is merely a noting\n   in the departmental file prepared by a low ranking officer, holding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                           25</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe post of Deputy Manager (M &amp; S Operations) in pursuance of\nthe representation of the petitioner seeking extension of time,\nwhich has no legal significance, except being an opinion of the\nofficer concerned. Moreover, Clause 16.9 of the Scheme clearly\nprovides that any amendment or modification in the terms and\nconditions in the Scheme shall be the discretion of the CIL/coal\ncompany. It is further contended that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nin catena of decisions has held that the noting of an officer in a file\nis nothing more than an opinion of an officer for internal use and\nunless final decision is taken, the same cannot be taken into\ncognizance in exercise of power of judicial review.

In the present case, the petitioner has relied upon a note sheet in\n    which Deputy Manager (M &amp; S Operation) of CCL dealing with the\n    application of the petitioner for extension of time, who made some\n    favourable comment. The said noting cannot be taken into\n    consideration for issuance of writ of mandamus in view of the fact\n    that the same cannot be treated as a decision in shape of an order\n    of the competent authority of CCL. It may at most be treated a\n    recommendation by a mid rank officer having no legal significance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">28. Learned senior counsel for the respondent-CCL has contended that\n    there were sufficient quantity of coal at the stockyard of mines and\n    had the petitioner deposited the full amount of the allotted rakes,\n    the same would have been delivered to it. So far as the short\n    delivery of coal against the paid amount of 125 rakes by the\n    petitioner is concerned, it has been contended that once the rake\n    is allotted, the delivery is made as per the prevalent Railways rules\n    and the allotment has non-lapsable character. Thus to proceed\n    further, it would be appropriate to examine the relevant provisions\n    of the Scheme which reads as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">              &quot;11.2.3 The validity of a monthly programme for movement by\n              rail for seeking allotment of rake shall be till day of the month\n              concerned and consent of the programme shall be issued by\n              the concerned coal company accordingly. However for the first\n              month after the commencement of the auction, the validity\n              period of the monthly programme for movement by rail for\n              seeking allotment of rake shall be thirty days from the auction\n              date. Once the rake is allotted, it shall remain valid for supply\n              of coal as per prevailing railways rules.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                               27</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">              14.

Clause 14.1 of the Scheme explicitly provides that if the bidder fails\n    to deposit the coal value within the stipulated time, the coal\n    company is entitled to forfeit the proportionate EMD equivalent to\n    the failed quantity subject to the provisions of the scheme and its\n    terms and conditions. However, Clause 14.3 further provides that\n    the forfeiture shall be not made if the coal company has failed to\n    offer full or part of the monthly scheduled quantity of the bidder\n    within the validity period. Admittedly, after allotment of coal, the\n    petitioner had initially provided the monthly scheduled quantity on\n    29.08.2016 whereby no rake was sought for two months i.e August\n    and September, 2016. However in the month of October, 2016,\n    the petitioner revised the MSQ unilaterally vide letter dated\n    21.10.2016 and sought no rake till November, 2016 and again in\n    the month of November, 2016, the petitioner revised the MSQ vide\n    letter dated 27.11.2016 and sought no rake till December, 2016\n    and further in the month January 2017 vide letter dated\n    30.01.2017, the petitioner again revised the MSQ and sought no\n    rake till February, 2017. Thus, for the first seven months, the\n    petitioner itself opted for &#x27;nil&#x27; supply and for the first time deposited\n    the value of coal in February, 2017 and immediately thereafter the\n    respondent CCL made sanction of coal leading to allotment of\n    rakes and, accordingly, supply of coal commenced in the month of\n    March, 2017. It further transpires from the record that subsequent\n    to deposit of the coal value by the petitioner, the respondent-CCL\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                              28</span>\n\n\n\n\n    sanctioned the coal within the validity period. Learned counsel for\n    the petitioner has given much stress on his argument that it has\n    been supplied only 85 rakes against the deposit of coal value of\n    125 rakes and thus the respondent-CCL has committed breach of\n    contract. However, it is noticed that as per the stipulation made in\n    Clause 11.2.3, once the rake is allotted, it shall remain valid for\n    supply of coal as per prevailing Railways rules. Thus, the argument\n    of the learned counsel for the respondent-CCL that the allotment\n    of rakes has non lapsable character appears more convincing.\n    Merely due to the reason that some rakes were still to be supplied,\n    does not entitle the petitioner to refuse to deposit the coal value\n    within the stipulated time i.e by 31.07.2017. The condition for\n    deposit of the coal value, being mandatory in nature, was required\n    to be followed by the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">30. Moreover, the petitioner did not deposit the coal value till January,\n    2017. However, the reason for not depositing the coal value till\n    January, 2017 has been explained by the learned counsel for the\n    petitioner by submitting that till that time the respondent-CCL was\n    not in a position to supply the coal and as such deposit of coal\n    value would not have changed the situation. I do not find force in\n    the said submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner. The\n    petitioner has failed to bring on record any letter issued by the\n    officials of the respondent-CCL whereby they had ever requested\n    the petitioner for changing the monthly scheduled quantity due to\n    non-availability of coal at the coal siding. It is the specific condition\n    stipulated in the Scheme that the supply would commence only on\n    the payment of coal value in advance. No relief can be granted to\n    the petitioner on the basis of this assumption that the deposit of\n    coal value would not have changed the situation as there was no\n    coal available at the coal siding.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">31. Moreover, Clause 14.1 of the Scheme explicitly provides that if the\n    bidder fails to make payment of the coal value of monthly\n    scheduled quantity including all other charges as applicable within\n    the stipulated time, the proportionate EMD equivalent to the failed\n    quantity shall be forfeited. Thus, it was obligatory on the part of\n    the petitioner to deposit the coal value within the stipulated time\n    which it failed to deposit, thus no relief can be granted to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                             29</span>\n\n\n\n\n    petitioner under extra ordinary writ jurisdiction as the petitioner\n    itself was at fault due to which the supply could not commence in\n    time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">32. The next limb of the argument of the learned counsel for the\n    petitioner is that 10 days&#x27; notice as provided under clause 8.3 of\n    the Scheme was not given to it before taking steps for forfeiture.\n    However, it appears from Clause 14.1 of the scheme (which deals\n    with the forfeiture of EMD) that the same does not provide for\n    giving any notice before passing of the order of forfeiture.\n    Moreover, admittedly a general notice dt. 17.07.2017 was given to\n    all the allottees to deposit the coal value till 31.07.2017 failing\n    which it was mentioned inter alia that action would be taken in\n    accordance with law and the said notice was responded by the\n    petitioner by submitting representations dated 19.07.2017 and\n    24.07.2017 requesting for extension of the validity period for lifting\n    of coal for e-auction phase-III. Thus, it cannot be said that the\n    petitioner has been put to any prejudice by non-issuance of show\n    cause notice before passing the impugned order of forfeiture. So\n    far the 10 days&#x27; notice stipulated in clause 8.4 is concerned, the\n    same is required to be given in a case if the bidder makes default\n    in lifting the coal so that it may be given an opportunity to pay the\n    amount under encashment by invocation of the bank guarantee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"111373359\" id=\"span_73\">33. The petitioner has claimed for extension of time for supply as well\n    as payment of the coal value, however, it failed to show any such\n    provision in the Scheme which provides for extension of time for\n    deposit of coal value. On the contrary, learned senior counsel for\n    the respondent-CCL has submitted that the terms and conditions\n    of the scheme is to be uniformly applied to all the Bidder and if\n    any relaxation is allowed in favour of the petitioner, it would\n    amount to bestowing unwarranted indulgence in favour of a single\n    entity. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/111373359/\" id=\"a_82\">Rajasthan\n    State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation</a>\n    (Supra.) has also held that a party cannot claim anything beyond\n    what is covered by the contract as it enters into a contract with\n    open eyes. I find no arbitrariness on the part of the respondent-\n    CCL in not extending time for deposit of coal value more so in view\n    of the fact that the petitioner itself was in default in not seeking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                             30</span>\n\n\n\n\n    supply for the first seven months and kept requesting for extension\n    of the time.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"111373359\" id=\"span_75\">34. So far as the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner\n    that the respondent-CIL/CCL has earlier extended time for\n    depositing coal value in e-auction Phase-II scheme is concerned,\n    the learned senior counsel for the respondent-CCL has submitted\n    that during the relevant period, the country was undergoing a\n    phase of demonetization as per the policy of the Central\n    Government and, therefore, the respondent-CIL took a policy\n    decision to extend time for depositing the coal value, which was\n    made uniformly applicable to all the customers. I find substance in\n    the said submission of the learned senior counsel for the\n    respondent-CCL. If any uniform policy decision is taken so as to\n    give certain relaxations to all the customers under extra ordinary\n    circumstance<a href=\"/doc/111373359/\" id=\"a_83\">, <a href=\"/doc/111373359/\" id=\"a_84\">the said decision</a></a> cannot be treated as a precedence\n    to be applied in an ordinary/normal situation. Thus, the instance\n    cited by the petitioner regarding extension of time granted by the\n    respondent-CIL during e-auction Phase-II scheme shall not be\n    applicable in the facts situation of the present case, which is\n    entirely different from the circumstances which prevailed during\n    the demonetization phase.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_78\">35. Learned counsel for the petitioner has vociferously argued that\n    once the rake is allotted, the respondent-CCL is bound to supply\n    the allotted coal within the stipulated validity period and if the CCL\n    failed to supply the coal within such period, no forfeiture of EMD\n    can be made. The said argument of learned counsel for the\n    petitioner is also misconceived. As per the Scheme, the contract\n    appears to be in two parts. The first part deals with the payment\n    issue under which the bidder is required to pay the coal value\n    within the stipulated time and if it fails to make the said payment,\n    the CCL is entitled to forfeit the EMD. However clause 14.3 saves\n    the forfeiture in a condition if the CCL does not offer the MSQ\n    within the validity period. Learned counsel for the petitioner tried\n    to convince this court that its case comes under clause 14.3 as no\n    supply was made to it within the stipulated time. In my considered\n    view, the petitioner has misconstrued the provision of clause 14.3\n    which speaks of the &#x27;offer&#x27; not the &#x27;supply&#x27;. The record reveals that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                             31</span>\n\n\n\n\n   as soon as the petitioner deposited the part coal value, the\n   respondent-CCL consented for supply within the validity period and\n   only thereafter the rakes were allotted for supply of coal. The said\n   fact has been admitted by the petitioner in the pleading. Moreover,\n   the petitioner opted for supply of coal through rail mode. Clause\n   11.2.3 of the scheme specifically provides that once the rake is\n   allotted, the same shall be valid as per Railways Rules. Thus, the\n   stand of the respondent-CCL that as soon as the petitioner paid\n   the coal value, the supply was made to it appears to be of\n   substance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">   W.P.(C) No.4426 of 2017:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">36.

The    petitioner\n   participated in the auction and was allotted total quantity of 81\n   rakes of coal to be lifted through rail mode from Piparwar Area of\n   Bachra Siding and it gave a declaration regarding distribution/\n   bifurcation of the quantity of coal in two months i.e March and\n   April 2017 and accordingly specified that it intends to lift 40 rakes\n   of coal in the month of March, 2017 and 41 rakes of coal in the\n   month of April, 2017.

The sanction was granted by the respondent-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                             32</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">    CCL to the Railways for allotment of rakes on 12.05.2017 and\n    thereafter allotment of 17 Railways rakes was made by the\n    Railways from 19.05.2017 till 24.05.2017. The petitioner, however,\n    submitted representation dated 08.05.2017 to the respondent-CCL\n    requesting therein for extending the period of deposit of the coal\n    value in respect of remaining 36 rakes of coal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\">37. The thrust of the argument of the learned counsel for the\n    petitioner is that inspite of the fact that 100% coal value of 46\n    rakes were paid to the respondent-CCL, only 8 rakes were supplied\n    to it till 31.05.2017 i.e the last day validity period, thus the\n    respondents have themselves violated the terms and conditions of\n    the scheme and as such the forfeiture of security deposit by the\n    CCL on the pretext that 100% coal value of total allotted quantity\n    of 81 rakes has not been deposited by the petitioner is highly\n    arbitrary. On the contrary, it is contended on behalf of the\n    respondent-CCL that the petitioner was duty bound to pay the coal\n    value of 53 rakes till 29.04.2017 failing which the consequence as\n    per the scheme is the forfeiture of EMD. So far as the supply part\n    is concerned, once the rake was allotted, the same remained valid\n    till supply as per Railways rules. Since advance payment for\n    balance 36 rakes along with the programme was not submitted by\n    the bidder (the petitioner) as per notified schedule, hence the offer\n    for loading of proportionate number of rakes by CCL could not be\n    forwarded to the Railways for allotment of rakes for the month of\n    April 2017. If the petitioner had submitted the coal value along\n    with the programme within the time schedule, all rakes would have\n    been offered to railways for allotment and supply.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">38. The fact of the present case is also identical to W.P.(C) No. 5329\n    of 2017 as in the present case also 100% coal value of the allotted\n    rakes were not paid by the petitioner till 29.04.2017 which was the\n    last date of payment. As already observed hereinabove, there are\n    two part of the contract i.e. &quot;the supply part&quot; and &quot;the payment\n    part&quot;. The petitioner was obligated to deposit 100% coal value\n    irrespective of supply. The supply was required to be made as per\n    the Railways&#x27; rules since the petitioner had chosen the supply\n    through the rail mode. It has been specifically mentioned in the\n    Scheme itself that once the allotment is made within the validity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                             33</span>\n\n\n\n\n    period, the same has non-lapsable character. It is evident from the\n    record that the petitioner had made the representations seeking\n    extension of time to deposit the coal value which reflects that the\n    petitioner was quite aware of the fact that it is bound to pay the\n    same within the validity period. So far the stand of non-extension\n    of time is concerned, the respondent- CCL has contended that the\n    terms and conditions of the scheme has been laid down for every\n    allottee and once the petitioner is given any relaxation, which\n    otherwise is not permissible, the whole purpose of the scheme\n    would frustrate. In the present case also it is evident that after\n    deposit of the coal value, the respondent-CCL offered the MSQ\n    within the validity period, thus, there appears no arbitrariness on\n    the part of the respondent-CCL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">39. So far as issue regarding delay in supply of the allotted coal raised\n    in both the writ petitions is concerned, the case of the petitioner\n    is that the delay has occasioned due to the fault of the respondent-\n    CCL as it did not have sufficient coal in the railways siding, whereas\n    the case of the respondent-CCL is that there was sufficient coal at\n    the stockyard and since the rakes were not placed at the railways\n    siding, the same was not supplied. The respondent-railways has\n    also supported the case of the petitioner that it was the\n    responsibility of the CCL to supply the coal after the allotment of\n    the rakes. Thus, the petitioner, the respondent-Railways and the\n    respondent-CCL have their own case to contend before this Court\n    about the delay occurred with respect to supply of coal for the\n    allotted rakes. Since the main issue before this Court is as to\n    whether the respondent-CCL is justified in forfeiting EMD of the\n    petitioner, this court is not inclined to enter into the disputed\n    question of fact as to who was at fault in delayed supply of the\n    allotted coal which requires laying of evidences and detailed\n    factual adjudication. Accordingly, the parties are free to move\n    before the appropriate forum for determination of the said issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_84\">40. In both the writ petitions, the petitioner has failed to deposit 100%\n    value of the allotted coal. Learned counsel for the petitioner has\n    tried to convince this court that the respondent-CCL has failed to\n    supply the monthly quantity within time and as such the EMD could\n    not be forfeited in view of Clause 14.3 of the Scheme. At the cost\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                        34</span>\n\n\n\n\n                of repetition, it is reiterated that the petitioner has wrongly\n                construed the provisions of the scheme. The scheme nowhere\n                provides that the payment of coal value would be dependent upon\n                the extent of supply. The only obligation on the part of the\n                respondent-CCL was to offer the MSQ within the validity period. If\n                on deposit of coal value, the offer is made by the respondent-CCL\n                and the rake is allotted by the Railways, the supply is to be\n                governed by the Railways rules.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">             41. Under the aforesaid facts and circumstances, both the writ\n                petitions being devoid of merit are, accordingly, dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">             42.
