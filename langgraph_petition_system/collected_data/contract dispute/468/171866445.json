However, the matter was finally disposed of by making it\n              clear that the direction issued in the case will be applicable only in\n              respect of 142 jobs out of 246 jobs in view of the fact that contract labour\n              has been abolished in respect of 104 jobs. Cause of action, if any, for the\n              petitioner has arisen by their alleged retrenchment made on 31.12.1996.\n              In the circumstances, particularly when in respect of certain employees,\n              industrial dispute had also been raised and a settlement had been\n              reached pursuant to which an award is made, if the applicants were\n              aggrieved they should have adopted that course as indicated by this\n              Court to be the normal course and what other employees have adopted in\n              the Industrial Dispute Case No.16 of 1996. Therefore, we think that it\n              would not be appropriate to allow this application, but it is made clear\n              that it is appropriate for the applicants to work out their remedies if\n              available under relevant labour enactments or otherwise, if any.

We, on\n\nexamination of the facts of these cases, have found that the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt after taking into consideration the fact that no notice was served upon\n\nthe management hence laid down therein that the Tribunal or the Labour\n\nCourt can exercise power for passing of order of restoration of the dispute for\n\nhearing afresh.

In such\n\nsituation, since the matter is pending before the Larger Bench in this respect,\n\nhence we thought it proper to apply the ratio of the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court by assessing the facts and circumstances of the case and for that\n\npurpose we have taken note of the judgement rendered in the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt in the case of Grindlays Bank Vrs.
