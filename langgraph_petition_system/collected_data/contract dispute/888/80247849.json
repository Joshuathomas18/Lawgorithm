The law is well-established that the bank which has\n        opened a letter of credit is not concerned with the relationship\n        between the seller and the customer; nor with the question\n        whether the seller had performed its contracted obligation or\n        not. The bank is also not concerned with the question whether\n        the seller is in default in any way or not. The machinery and\n        the commitment of the bank are on a different level. It has\n        been emphasized by the English Courts and also by the\n        Supreme Court that the bank must be allowed to honour its\n        commitments under a letter of credit free from interference by\n        the Courts; otherwise, trust in international commerce will be\n        irreparably damaged. The dispute as to the sufficiency of the\n        performance between the buyer and the seller or between the\n        seller and the buyer cannot be the reason for withholding the\n        payment under a letter of credit. The bank is only required to\n        see whether the event has happened on which its obligation to\n        pay has arisen.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        45. In this case, the Central Bank was required to pay in terms\n        of the letter of credit against certain documents. The\n        documents have been duly tendered and accepted by the\n        Central Bank and the event has happened on which the Central\n        Bank is now obliged to pay in terms of the letter of credit.\n        Whether the goods that have been delivered are of\n        merchantable quality or not or whether the goods are up to the\n        contract or not or whether they are of the specified quality or\n        quantity cannot be gone into by the bank. Similarly, the\n        question whether the goods correspond with the description is\n        also a question that must be resolved by the buyer and the\n        seller in an appropriate proceeding. But the Central Bank\n        which has opened a confirmed and irrevocable letter of credit\n        cannot refuse to pay even when all the terms of the letter of\n        credit have been fulfilled to its satisfaction on the plea that the\n        goods are not up to the contract or do not correspond with the\n        description. The bank is not entitled to withhold payment after\n        its obligation to pay has arisen merely because an allegation of\n        fraud has been made against the seller. As Browne L. J.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">FAO (OS) 549/2014                                              Page 10 of 19</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">         emphasized in the case of Edward Owen that it was not\n        enough to allege fraud. If that was possible in law, all that a\n        buyer had to do to stop payment under an irrevocable letter of\n        credit was to allege fraud against the seller. It is very easy to\n        allege fraud whenever there is a dispute as to quantity or\n        quality of the goods. But that cannot be the ground on which\n        the bank will be entitled to refuse payment. As Lord Denning\n        has emphasized that the rule, in the case of a confirmed\n        irrevocable credit in respect of contract for the sale of goods, is\n        that the confirming bank is in no way concerned with disputes\n        between the buyer and the seller as to the contract of sale\n        which underlies the credit and it is a strict rule. In order to\n        come within the exception, the buyer must not only allege but\n        clearly establish that the documents that were presented by the\n        beneficiary were forged or fraudulent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_12\">16.

Singh Consultants and\nEngineers (P) Ltd.</a>, (1988) 1 SCC 174, wherein the court re-emphasized the\nprinciple that the letter of credit must not be interfered with by the courts as\nthe restraint on encashment of the same has major implications upon the\ninternational commerce as well as it hinders the autonomous nature of the\ntransaction. The court has held that the Bank is required to just look into the\ncorrectness and appropriateness of the documents and if the same are found\nto be in order, the other consideration of the main underlying contract does\nnot affect the encashment of the letter of the credit. The relevant paras of the\nJudgment are noteworthy:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        &quot;44. The modern documentary credit had its origin from letters\n        of credit. We may, therefore, begin the discussion with the\n        traditional letter of credit. Paul R. Verkuil in an article [Bank\n        Solvency and Guaranty Letters of Credit, Standford Law\n        Review V. 25 (1972-73 at p. 719)] explains the salient features\n        of a letter of credit in these terms:\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">FAO (OS) 549/2014                                              Page 11 of 19</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">         The letter of credit is a contract. The issuing party- usually a\n        bank-promises to pay the &#x27;beneficiary&#x27;-traditionally a seller of\n        goods-on demand if the beneficiary presents whatever\n        documents may be required by the letter. They are normally\n        the only two parties involved in the contract. The bank which\n        issues a letter of credit acts as a principal, not as agent for its\n        customer, and engages its own credit. The letter of credit thus\n        &#x27;evidences-irrevocable obligation to honour the draft presented\n        by the beneficiary upon compliance with the terms of the\n        credit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        45. The letter of credit has been developed over hundreds of\n        years of international trade. It was most commonly used in\n        conjunction with the sale of goods between geographically\n        distant parties. It was intended to facilitate the transfer of\n        goods between distant and unfamiliar buyer and seller. It was\n        found difficult for the seller to rely upon the credit of an\n        unknown customer. It was also found difficult for a buyer to\n        pay for goods prior to their delivery. The bank&#x27;s letter of credit\n        came into existence to bridge this gap. In such transactions, the\n        seller (beneficiary) receives payment from issuing bank when\n        he presents a demand as per terms of the documents. The bank\n        must pay if the documents are in order and the terms of credit\n        are satisfied. The bank, however, was not allowed to determine\n        whether the seller had actually shipped the goods or whether\n        the goods conformed to the requirements of the contract. Any\n        dispute between the buyer and the seller must be settled\n        between themselves. The Courts, however, carved out an\n        exception to this rule of absolute independence. The Courts\n        held that if there has been &quot;fraud in the transaction&quot; the bank\n        could dishonour beneficiary&#x27;s demand for payment. The Courts\n        have generally permitted dishonour only on the fraud of the\n        beneficiary, not the fraud of somebody else.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_14\">17.

But the evidence must be\n        clear, both as to the fact of fraud and as to the bank&#x27;s\n        knowledge. It would certainly not normally be sufficient that\n        this rests on the uncorroborated statement of the customer, for\n        irreparable damage can be done to a bank&#x27;s credit in the\n        relatively brief time which must elapse between the granting of\n        such an injunction and an application by the bank to have it\n        discharged.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"573550\" id=\"span_17\">19.

The grant of injunction is a discretionary power in equity\n        jurisdiction. The contract of guarantee is a trilateral contract\n        which the bank has undertaken to unconditionally and\n        unequivocally abide by the terms of the contract. It is an act of\n        trust with full faith to facilitate free flow of trade and\n        commerce in internal or international trade or business. It\n        creates an irrevocable obligation to perform the contract in\n        terms thereof. On the occurrence of the events mentioned\n        therein the bank guarantee becomes enforceable. The\n        subsequent disputes in the performance of the contract does\n        not give rise to a cause nor is the court justified on that basis,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">FAO (OS) 549/2014                                             Page 13 of 19</span>\n         to issue an injunction from enforcing the contract, i.e. bank\n        guarantee.

He must necessarily plead and produce all the\n        necessary evidence in proof of the fraud in execution of the\n        contract of the guarantee, but not the contract either of the\n        original contract or any of the subsequent events that may\n        happen as a ground for fraud.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"573550\" id=\"span_19\">20.

Irretrievable injury is of the\n        nature as noticed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/573550/\" id=\"a_17\">Itek Corporation</a> (supra). Here\n        there is no such problem. Once the plaintiff is able to establish\n        fraud against the suppliers or suppliers-cum-lenders and\n        obtains any decree for damages or dimunition in price, there is\n        no problem for affecting recoveries in a friendly country where\n        the bankers and the suppliers are located.

The UCP 600 in <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 5</a> states that &quot;Banks deal with documents and\nnot with goods, services or performance to which the documents may\nrelate&quot;, therefore the Banks as parties to a letter of credit are not required to\nconcern themselves with the actual performance of the services that were to\nbe rendered and if the requisite documents are in order then the said Banks\nare required to perform their obligations under the letter of credit. In the\ninstant case as can be seen from the respondent No.2&#x27;s reply to respondent\nNo.1 dated 15th November, 2014, the requisite documents were submitted to\nit by the appellant as early as 14th July, 2014 and therefore the respondent\nNo.2 was obliged to make the payment to appellant on the payment due date\nof 19th December, 2014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">24.

The said Bank is also relieved from any\nresponsibility about the disputes arising out of the main contract between the\nseller and the buyer. Essentially, the said rule is the rule of privity of\ncontract enshrined in the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_27\">Contract Act</a> wherein the party who is not privity\nof the contract does not accept any responsibility in the contract between the\nthird parties.

Bank of India and Ors.</a>, AIR 1981 SC\n1426, the court also emphasized about the presence or absence of the\nprovisions in the letter of credit which governs the bank&#x27;s responsibility by\nstating as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">        &quot;The rule is well established that a bank issuing or confirming\n        a letter of credit is not concerned with the underlying contract\n        between the buyer and seller. Duties of a bank under a letter of\n        credit are created by the document itself, but in any case it has\n        the power and is subject to the limitations which are given or\n        imposed by it, in the absence of the appropriate provisions in\n        the letter of credits of a bank&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28176\" id=\"span_33\">27.    The Supreme Court again came up with the similar question in\n<a href=\"/doc/28176/\" id=\"a_29\">Federal Bank Ltd v. V.M. Jog Engineering Ltd and Others</a>, (2001) 1 SCC\n663, wherein the court again said that the contract of the Bank guarantee or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">FAO (OS) 549/2014                                            Page 17 of 19</span>\n the Letter of Credit is independent of the main contract between the seller\nand the buyer. This is also clear from <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 3</a> of the UCP (1983 Revision).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"28176\" id=\"span_35\">28.    Mr.Vashist, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant, has made his submissions before us that the impugned order\npassed by the learned Single Judge is against the settled proposition of law\nwhich has been <a href=\"/doc/28176/\" id=\"a_31\">laid down by</a> a catena of judgments of the Apex Court\nrelating to the question of injunction. He also contends that the respondent\nNo.1 has received the goods which were in conformity with the agreement\nentered into between the respondent No. 1 and respondent No.3. He says\nthat in case the goods have not been received or the same were not in\nconformity with the agreement, the respondent No.1 has a remedy to take\nthe appropriate action against the respondent No.3 as per the agreement. He\nfurther states that the money has already gone from the pocket of his client.\nThe respondent No.1 is at liberty to sue respondent No.3 on the issue of\nfraud if any committed by the respondent No.3. The appellant has not\ncommitted any fraud. We find force in the submissions of the learned\ncounsel for the appellant. Therefore, the interim order passed by the learned\nSingle Judge is contrary to the settled law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"921352\" id=\"span_36\">29.    Mr.Sethi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\nrespondent No.1, states that his client has not received the goods and the\nfraud has been committed against respondent No.1. He further submits that\nsince the appellant has failed to honour the condition that as per the Letter of\nCredit, therefore, the learned Single Judge has rightly passed the status quo\norder in the matter. He referred the decision of the Supreme Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/921352/\" id=\"a_32\">State Bank of India and Ors. vs. Manganese Ore (India) Ltd. and\nAnr.</a>, (1996) 11 SCC 113.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">FAO (OS) 549/2014                                             Page 18 of 19</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"921352\" id=\"span_38\">30.    We have gone through the decision referred by Mr.Sethi, learned\nsenior counsel for the respondent No.1. The above said judgment referred\nby Mr.Sethi does not help the case the respondent No.1 on the two reasons;\nfirstly that the provisions of UCP 600 have not been discussed and secondly\nafter passing <a href=\"/doc/921352/\" id=\"a_33\">the said judgment</a>, catena of judgments has been rendered by\nthe Supreme Court discussing the similar issue.        It is also pertinent to\nmention that the provisions of UCP 600 have not been discussed which are\napplicable inter se banks. Thus<a href=\"/doc/921352/\" id=\"a_34\">, <a href=\"/doc/921352/\" id=\"a_35\">the said judgment</a></a> is distinguishable on this\nreason. It is also pertinent to mention that no reasons have been assigned in\nthe impugned order which is mandatory under the proviso of Rule 3 of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_36\">Order\nXXXIX CPC</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">31.    Having considered the entire gamut of the matter, we are of view that\nthe impugned order is not sustainable in law on merit. Even otherwise, the\nsame is liable to be set aside in view of the absence of the reasons.\nAccordingly, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order with regard to\ndirection to the parties to maintain status quo regarding the two LCs in\nquestion till the next date of hearing is set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">32.
