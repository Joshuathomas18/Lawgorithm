The respondent capriciously taking subterfuge under\n                      the terms of the contract is nothing but an attempt to elude and escape its\n                      liability and cover its own lapses and delays.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">                      18.

It is further submitted\n                      on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner has already received all the\n                      legal and genuine outstanding payments except one pending final bill. An\n                      Acknowledgement Certificate dated 29th August, 2022 has already been\n                      issued by the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">                      22.   It is submitted that the petitioner has received the entire payments\n                      and, thereupon, issued a No-Claim Certificate dated 30th August, 2022,\n                      hence, there is no valid claim pending against the respondent. The\n                      principal owner/beneficiary of the project, i.e. State Urban Development\n                      Authority (hereinafter referred to as &quot;SUDA&quot;), Haryana, has already been\n                      informed about the pending final bill of the petitioner. The learned\n                      counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that there are no\n                      arbitral disputes between the parties that would need adjudication by an\n                      arbitrator or by this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">                      23.   The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that the\n                      present petition filed by the petitioner is contrary to the mandate of pre-\n                      arbitration procedure in accordance with the terms of Clause 25 of the\n                      GCC, which is sine qua non for invoking the said arbitration clause. In\n                      light of the settled principle of law, it has been submitted on behalf of the\n                      respondent that it is essential for the parties to exhaust the pre-arbitration\n                      mandate as provided under the contract in order to invoke the arbitration\n                      clause.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                      ARB.P. 1146/2022                                            Page 8 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">By:GAURAV SHARMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Signing Date:24.02.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">18:21:12</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">                                    NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001374\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">                      24.

It is further submitted that\n                      upon bare perusal of the tender document, it is evident that the respondent\n                      had invited tender for and on behalf of the SUDA vide NTT No.\n                      HPL/PM(C)/TC/NLUM/2018-19/61 dated 6th October, 2018.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">                      27.   It is submitted that as per law, once the principal beneficiary is\n                      disclosed, the executing agency cannot be made liable and hence, the\n                      Agreement in the instant matter cannot be enforced against the\n                      respondent herein. The beneficiary is a necessary party for just and proper\n                      adjudication of the dispute between the parties, however, the petitioner\n                      has failed to make the beneficiary a party to the petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">                      28.

This Court has given thoughtful consideration to the facts and\n                      circumstances of the case. In terms of the above, it is significant for this\n                      Court to bifurcate the controversy into the following issues for\n                      adjudication:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                           I.

The doctrine emphasizes on the\n                      principle that the arbitration clause in a contract is treated separately from\n                      the main contract and it continues to be in effect even if the main contract\n                      is invalidated, vitiated, or terminated for any reason. It is crystal clear that\n                      an arbitration clause is independent of the underlying contract. It makes\n                      sure that if one party alleges that the other breached the terms of the\n                      agreement, the agreement will remain in effect for the purposes of\n                      quantifying the claims arising from such breach.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140286\" id=\"span_67\">36.

The law of severability is not alien to English Jurisprudence of\n                      Arbitration as well. It was first recognised by Lord Macmillan in the\n                      judgment titled as Heyman v. Darwins Ltd 1942 AC 356 wherein it was\n                      observed that an arbitration agreement has to be seen as distinct from the\n                      agreement or contract itself.

It is pertinent to mention that an arbitration\n                      clause is envisaged in a contract or agreement as an Alternative Dispute\n                      Resolution mechanism in case of any discrepancy arising out such\n                      contract or agreement. The sole purpose of the arbitration/dispute\n                      resolution clause is to enable the parties to address their grievances and\n                      protect their rights arising out of the contract. The Rule of Severability\n                      ensures the validity and enforceability of the arbitration clause in a\n                      contract even when the primary contract becomes invalid or is frustrated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_57\">                      39.   In the instant matter, the primary contention of the respondent\n                      while objecting to invocation of arbitration proceedings and appointing\n                      an arbitrator, is that the petitioner had issued a No-Claim Certificate,\n                      however, the discussion as aforesaid, which settles the principle of\n                      Doctrine of Severability by the interpretation of the Hon‟ble Supreme\n                      Court, clarifies that the arbitration clause and agreement dare not vitiated\n                      because of the same. In view of the foregoing discussions, this Court\n                      while adjudicating the Issue No.I finds that if a No-Claim Declaration has\n                      been given by a party it would not render the entire arbitration agreement\n                      void on the basis of Doctrine of Severability.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">                      Issue II : Whether the arbitration proceedings can be invoked when the\n                      parties have failed to comply with the pre-arbitration procedure?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">                      40.

There is no doubt that arbitration clauses exist\n                      in both these agreements and as stipulated in GCC, a pre-arbitration\n                      procedure had to be followed but the same is not a mandate under SCC.\n                      Since both the agreements are to be construed harmoniously, the\n                      invocation of arbitration proceedings cannot be rendered void due to mere\n                      discrepancy arising out of these two respective clauses.

Since,\n                      the parties are in conflict with two different clauses of two separate\n                      agreements, this Court is of the view that the same requires interpretation\n                      of the said clauses to figure out the prevalence of one clause over another.\n                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_150\">Thus, this Court without adjudicating upon the interpretation finds it\n                      imperative to refer the same to an arbitrator in light of the precedent\n                      settled by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/121987320/\" id=\"a_33\">Vidya Drolia</a> (supra).\n                      Conclusion</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">                      51.   In view of the facts, circumstances of the instant case and the\n                      position of law as discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, this Court is of\n                      the view that No-Claim Declaration given by the petitioner, would not\n                      extinguish its remedy to seek legal recourse as prescribed under the\n                      arbitration clauses in the agreement. The questions whether there is a\n                      non-joinder of the parties, and in what circumstances the earlier petition\n                      by the petitioner was withdrawn and the No-Claim Declaration was\n                      given, are the questions of fact which this Court shall not delve into under\n                      while exercising its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 11</a> of the Act, 1996.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">                      52.   This Court without going into the merits of the case, is prima facie\n                      of the view that there is an arbitrable dispute between the parties and the\n                      same must be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal which would be the\n                      competent authority as per the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle inclusive\n                      of the issues pertaining to non-joinder of beneficiary and to the dispute\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                      ARB.P. 1146/2022                                           Page 25 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">By:GAURAV SHARMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Signing Date:24.02.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">18:21:12</span>\n                                     NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2023/DHC/001374\n\n\n\n\n                      whether No Claim Declaration was obtained under economic duress or\n                      not.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_157\">53.    This Court further holds forth that if there exists an arbitration\n                      clause between the parties in SCC which is sought to be overridden by\n                      another provision existing in GCC by the respondent, it requires\n                      interpretation of both the clauses to figure out the prevalence of one\n                      clause over the other. The settled rule of law in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/121987320/\" id=\"a_35\">Vidya\n                      Drolia</a> (supra) is &quot;when in doubt, do refer&quot;. Therefore, the interpretation\n                      of the above-mentioned clauses pertaining to Arbitration can be\n                      adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal in exercise of its own competence\n                      and jurisdiction.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">                      54.    Hence, in light of the foregoing discussion and analysis, this Court\n                      is inclined to refer the disputes between the parties in the instant matter to\n                      arbitration holding forth the spirit of the Act, 1996 as well as the two key\n                      doctrines discussed above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">                      55.      In view of the submissions made by the parties and to resolve the\n                      dispute arising out of the contract/agreement, the parties are referred to\n                      arbitration before the Sole Arbitrator appointed by this Court.
