JUSTICE J.B.PARDIWALA)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1.       Since the issues in all the captioned writ-applications are\ninter-related and the parties are also the same, those were\ntaken up for hearing analogously and are being disposed of by\nthis common judgment and order.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.       In the Special Civil Application No.11391 of 2020 the\nwrit-applicant seeks to challenge the action of the respondents\nin forfeiting the security deposit and also the issue of show\ncause notice calling upon the writ-applicant to show cause why\nhe should not be put on holiday-mode. The writ-applicant has\nalso prayed to restrain the respondents from encashing the\nbank guarantee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.       In the Special Civil Application No.276 of 2021 the writ-\napplicant seeks to challenge the order banning him for a\nperiod of two years consequent to the show cause notice\nreferred to above and challenged in the connected writ-\napplication.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">4.       In the Special Civil Application No.13888 of 2020 the\nsubject matter of challenge is the illegal exclusion of the writ-\napplicant from a tender process, wherein although the writ-\napplicant was adjudged to be technically competent, yet was\nnot permitted to participate in view of the order putting the\nwrit-applicant on a holiday-mode.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                               Page 2 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">      C/SCA/11391/2020                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5.       We first take up the Special Civil Application No.276 of\n2021. By this writ-application under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India the writ-applicant has prayed for the\nfollowing reliefs:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;(A) The Hon&#x27;ble Court be pleased to admit and allow this\n        Special Civil Application.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        (B) The Hon&#x27;ble Court be pleased to issue writ of certiorari\n        calling for records and proceedings in reference to banning\n        the     petitioner     from   having     business   dealings      with      the\n        respondent relying upon the report of the enquiry conducted\n        by the respondents in respect to its decision dated 16.12.2020\n        having          reference   No.MHN/MM/ST/CONTRACT/270/2015-16\n        and after perusing such records and proceedings, be pleased\n        to quash and set aside the impugned decision at Annexure A\n        taken by the respondent of banning the petitioner for two\n        years from having business dealings with the respondent.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        (C) The Hon&#x27;ble Court be pleased to stay the impugned\n        decision dated 16.12.2020 having reference No. MHN/MM/ST/\n        CONTRACT/270/2015-16 pending admission, hearing and final\n        disposal of the Special Civil Application.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        (D) The Hon&#x27;ble Court be pleased to pass any other just and\n        proper order as deemed fit in favor of the applicant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      Page 3 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                             Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">      C/SCA/11391/2020                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.       It   appears   from   the    materials   on       record       that      the\nrespondent - ONGC issued a tender notice dated 9.8.2016 for\nhiring of services for operation and maintenance of South\nSanthal ETP, ONGC, Mehsana Asset. The bid offered by the\nwrit-applicant came to be accepted and he was awarded\ncontract to run and manage the ETP for a period of five years.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.       It   further   appears   that     although     the      writ-applicant\nsucceeded in getting the contract awarded in his favour, yet\nproblems cropped up between the parties from day one. The\nONGC issued a show cause notice dated 31.8.2020 to the writ-\napplicant (Annexure-G page-68) calling upon the writ-applicant\nto show cause why the writ-applicant should not be put on\nholiday or in other words should not be blacklisted.

The contract was to &quot;Operate and Maintain the\n  4000m3/Day Effluent Treatment Plant of South Santhal ET in\n  accordance with the Scope Of Work, Technical Specifications,\n  Special Conditions of Contract, Price Schedule and other terms\n  &amp; conditions specified at Annexure-B of the contract of\n  contract no. 903007471.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">  3.     It is observed that right from the beginning of the\n  contract, serious violations of conditions of the contract had\n  begun to take place. Indicative violations which were\n  repeatedly brought to the notice of M/S. Global S S\n  Construction Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, verbally and in writing, were:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">  I.     Frequent Non-availability of dozing chemicals such as\n  PAC &amp; DOPE at the plant and consequently failure to meet the\n  desired quality of the treated water. This resulted in reduction\n  in injectivity of the disposal wells and increase in well\n  maintenance costs. The provisioning and supply chain\n  management of the chemicals was completely in the scope of\n  M/S. Global S S as per the contract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">  II.     Non-availability of M/S Global SS&#x27;s site-coordinator at\n  SS ETP for long periods at a stretch on multiple occasions\n  leading to serious problems of plant operation, maintenance\n  management, record-keeping and coordination between ONGC\n  &amp; the O&amp;M agency. This absence of site-coordinator was in\n  contravention to the requirement of Essential O &amp; M Crew\n  specified under Appendix-2 of Annexure-B of the contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">  III. Non-conformity to the maintenance and safety\n  requirements contained in the contract. The complete\n  absence /non-adherence to a systematic planned preventive\n  maintenance schedule of process, mechanical &amp; electrical\n  equipment not only led to premature deterioration of their\n  condition but also seriously impacted the safety integrity of\n  the plant, which is a long-term loss to ONGC. It was observed\n  that even basic maintenance consumables were not maintained\n  at the site. As a result it was found that the plant was being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                           Page 5 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                          JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n  operated without redundancies since many of the equipment\n  remained under prolonged break-downs. Contractor personnel\n  were not provided with proper PPE and safety shoes as has\n  been mandated in the contract. The MVT training for the\n  contractual manpower, which was a mandatory and statutory\n  obligation under the contract, non-compliance being\n  punishable offence under law, was found not imparted to the\n  contractual personnel.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">  IV.    Non-payment of wages to O&amp;M personnel. It was also\n  brought to the notice of ONGC on various occasions by the\n  O&amp;M personnel that they were not being paid their wages,\n  which was a violation of the conditions and also statutory\n  obligation under the contract\n\n  V.     Abandonment of the plant by the contractual persons\n  on 06.07.2020 citing non-payment of wages thereby completely\n  bringing the plant to a standstill and seriously jeopardizing\n  ONGC&#x27;s operations in Santhal field.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">  VI.    The gross violation and non-compliance of contract\n  conditions, had serious impact not only on the quality of the\n  treated water, but also significantly compromised the health of\n  the equipment and safety adequacy of the plant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">  ONGC&#x27;s concerns regarding these issues of non-performance\n  were conveyed right through the duration of the contract\n  verbally as well as through numerous written communications.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">  4.     In view of the continuously deteriorating services, and\n  also the critical importance of the effluent treatment function\n  of ONGC&#x27;s operations, ONGC issued numerous notices advising\n  M/S Global S S Construction Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai to take\n  immediate steps for correcting the performance and\n  compliance of contractual conditions and obligations. However,\n  no response or effort was evident from your side.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">  5.     The services under the contract had completely failed\n  and repeated requests, advices and directives of ONGC over a\n  three year period had yielded no adequate and satisfactory\n  response from M/S Global S S Construction Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai\n  and finally due to the complete failure of O &amp; M services on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                          Page 6 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                               Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                           JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n  06.07.2020, ONGC terminated the contract and invoked the\n  performance bank guarantee submitted against the instant\n  tender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">  6.     Consequent to the termination of the contract,\n  Competent authority has approved the initiation of enquiry\n  against M/S Global S S Construction Pvt. Ltd,(Vendor\n  code:838505), as per provision of Clause 18.6 of contract and\n  the enquiry proceeding is governed by ONGC&#x27;s Integrated\n  Material Management Manual &amp; General Conditions of the\n  Contract, wherein undersigned is appointed as Enquiry Officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">  7.     The undersigned in the capacity of Enquiry officer has\n  observed that M/S Global S S Construction Pvt.

The writ-applicant responded to the above referred show\ncause notice by filing reply dated 11.9.2020. In its reply, the\nwrit-applicant took the stance that his performance was not\ngood as there were many shortcomings and deficiencies in the\nplant itself. The writ-applicant informed the ONGC that it\nshould       not        be   held    responsible      for    the     turbidity         and\nfilterability. In other words, the writ-applicant pointed out to\nthe ONGC that the plant was not designed for removing the\nturbidity and filterability from the trade effluent. The writ-\napplicant also made a request that he may be afforded\npersonal hearing before any final decision is taken.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">9.

Mr. Bhargav Hasurkar, the learned counsel appearing for\nthe applicant vehemently submitted that the impugned order is\nerroneous and illegal as the mandatory thirty days notice as\nstipulated in the terms and conditions of the agreement was\nnot   issued.        He   would   submit      that   the   impugned            order\nterminating the contract has ultimately led to the order placing\nhis client in the holiday list/blacklisted and such action has\nbeen challenged by way of the connected writ-application i.e.\nthe Special Civil Application No.11391 of 2020.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                  Page 11 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                           Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">    C/SCA/11391/2020                                     JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n\n11.1 Mr. Hasurkar fairly pointed out that after the contract\ncame to be terminated his client invoked the arbitration clause\nand called upon the ONGC to appoint an arbitrator. According\nto Mr. Hasurkar, the ONGC declined to appoint any arbitrator.\nIn such circumstances, the writ-applicant had to come before\nthis Court by filing application under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 11</a> of the\nArbitration       Act   for   getting    an       arbitrator     appointed.

Mr. Khare would submit that the\nshow cause notice issued by the ONGC dated 31.8.2020 makes\nthe picture abundantly clear. He would submit that not only\nthe performance of the writ-applicant was found to be\nunsatisfactory, but the writ-applicant is guilty of abandoning\nthe plant during the covid period. This led to a serious impact\nnot only on the quality of the treated water but also\nsignificantly on the performance of the equipments and safety\nof the plant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">12.3 Mr. Khare invited the attention of this Court to few\nrelevant averments made in the affidavit-in-reply.

I further say &amp; submit that the petitioner is trying to\n     take shelter of pandemic situation for its non-performance of\n     contract and trying to invoke Force Majure. It is to state that\n     the Government of India had imposed a nationwide lockdown\n     by order dated 24.03.2020 under <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_3\">Disaster Management Act,\n     2005</a> with effect from 2503.2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic\n     situation.

Thereby, meaning the\n   activities and the scope of work under the subject contract\n   was covered under the essential services.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">   10. I further say &amp; submit that the petitioner instead of\n   supporting respondent for smooth functioning of SSETP, had\n   actually abandoned the contract during the lockdown period\n   and had tried to invoke Force Majeure clause no.23.0 by its\n   letter dated 29.05.2020 (Page No.62). In the said letter, the\n   petitioner had pleaded lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic\n   situation for discontinuation of contract and invoking of force\n   majeure. The respondent, vide its email dated 01.06.2020 and\n   09.06.2020(Page No.63), had replied to petitioner by\n   communicating their decisions for rejecting such force majeure\n   on the ground that\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">   (a). there were no restrictions for essential services in District,\n   Mehasana during the lockdown period from 23.03.2020 to\n   31.05.2020 and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">   (b). during the unlock period starting from 01.06.2020 such\n   restrictions were further relaxed for all purposes by\n   Government of India.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"29719380\" id=\"span_27\">It is important to note that the petitioner had knowingly\n   suppressed ONGC&#x27;s reply email dt. 01/06/2020 in which ONGC\n   had given above stated reasons for rejecting claim of Force\n   Majeure. The copy of said ONGC email dt. 01/06/2020 is\n   annexed herewith and marked as Annexure -- R-IV.

I further say and submit that ONGC. vide letter dated\n   06.07.2020 (Page No.64), had intimated the petitioner about\n   deficiency in performance of the contract as well as\n   abandoning the contract site which had created a Labour\n   unrest due to non-payment of wages by it. Thus, ONGC by\n   the said letter had also intimated the petitioner about\n   abandonment of contract and further action to be taken by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                            Page 15 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                             JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n   ONGC against the contractor under the contractual provision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">   It is further submitted that based on the aforesaid facts and\n   inability of the petitioner to perform the contract, ONGC was\n   compelled to terminate the contract by its letter dated\n   16.07.2020 (Page No.65) on account of abandoning of contract\n   by petitioner. It said termination letter, ONGC had also\n   intimated about forfeiting of bank guarantees and putting the\n   contractor on holiday period resulting into banning for two\n   years. In reply to the said termination notices, the petitioner,\n   vide its letter dated 18.07.2020 (Page No. 66), had alleged\n   various allegations against the respondent and tried to\n   substantiate its absence due to Covid-19 and requested ONGC\n   to continue its contract. It is to be noted that the said letter\n   dated 18.07.2020 is self-contradictory to the petitioner&#x27;s earlier\n   letter dated 29.05.2020 which clearly proves the mala-fide\n   intention of the petitioner to take undue benefit out of\n   nationwide lockdown.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">   12. I further say and submit that after termination of the\n   contract    by    ONGC,     it    had     issued  letter  dated\n   27.08.2020forintimating the petitioner about suspension till the\n   proceedings for putting petitioner onholiday for a period of\n   two years is decided. The copy of said ONGC letter dt.\n   27/08/2020 is annexed herewith and marked as Annexure-R-V.\n   Subsequently, ONGC had also issued show cause notice dated\n   31.08.2020 (Page No. 68) by pointing out all deficiency &amp;\n   breach in performance of the contract even prior to lockdown\n   period and had called upon the petitioner to substantiate its\n   reasons for the same. Against the said Show Cause Notice, the\n   Petitioner had replied by its letter dt.11/09/2020. The Copy of\n   reply letter dt. 11/09/2020 is annexed herewith and marked\n   as Annexure R-VI. Subsequently, the Enquiry Officer had\n   concluded the enquiry and had recommended for putting\n   petitioner on holiday period of 2 years. Thereafter, the\n   competent authority had accepted the recommendation of\n   enquiry officer and by letter dt.16/12/2020 (page no. 27) had\n   intimated the petitioner about putting petitioner on holiday\n   for 2 years from 27.08.2020 to 27.08.2022.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">   13. I say and submit that it is evident from the above facts\n   that the petitioners have failed to perform the contract since\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                            Page 16 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                  Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                            JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n   inception and are now trying to take advantage a force\n   majeure clause in guise of nationwide lockdown between the\n   23.03.2020 to 21.05.2020. It is to state that as per clause\n   No.23 of GCC, it has been agreed between the parties that a\n   force majeure shall mean an Act of God, war, civil riots, fire,\n   flood, directly affecting the performance of the contract.\n   Under the said clause it is also to agree that the petitioner\n   was required to give notice in writing for force majeure\n   within 72 hours of beginning of such cause. Whereas in the\n   instance case the lockdown was implemented by official order\n   dated 23.03.2020 which was highly circulated in media and\n   petitioner had claimed such force majeure after expiry of\n   entire lockdown period by letter dated 29.05.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">   ii) Moreover, as per Clause No.23, if the force majeure\n   continued for more than a period two months, then ONGC\n   had the option of cancelling the subject contract at its\n   discretion without any liability. But in present case it is\n   petitioner who had rescind the contract by its letter\n   dt.29/05/2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">   iii) It is important to note that various other contractors who\n   were engaged in operation and maintenance of the various\n   other activities of the plant had continued to perform the\n   contract even during the lockdown period also which proves\n   that there was no real restriction for such essential services by\n   the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">   Thus, the petitioner had failed to point out special equities or\n   situation which had compelled the petitioner to not perform\n   the subject contract since 2016 and also during the lock down\n   period. The petitioner had also failed to provide any reason\n   for his nonperformance of the contract for a period prior to\n   lockdown since awarding of the contract. Thus, the action\n   initiated by ONGC against the petitioner is per the contractual\n   provision and based on the unsatisfactory performance since\n   awarding of the contract till the date of termination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">   14. I respectfully say and submit that ONGC vide letter dt.\n   27.08.2020 while suspending business with petitioner under\n   subject contract had explicitly intimated that it would not\n   affect the on going contract awarded to petitioner. Thus,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                            Page 17 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                            JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n   Petitioner cannot suffer any damages in the ongoing contracts\n   which it had stated in the petitioner. It is pertinent to note\n   that performance of contracts is assed on individual contract\n   basis. So, a contractor may be able to perform some contract\n   but it may fail to perform in another contract due to not\n   being able to handle the increased scale of business or\n   peculiar location of contract. Thus, ONGC had only put\n   petitioner on holiday and not black listed it. The purpose of\n   putting contractors on holiday is to gain experience from\n   failure in performance of contract and to evolve in scale &amp;\n   size within 2 years to re-bidding in the tenders of the\n   respondent. Thus, the banning is only beneficial to petitioner\n   for not continue losses &amp; get over loaded with contractual\n   liabilities. Therefore, decision of putting petitioner on holiday\n   for 2 years cannot be termed as harsh or punitive actions of\n   ONGC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">   15. I lastly say and submit that the petitioner had already\n   invoked arbitration clause No.27 by its letter dated\n   22.09.2020. It is submitted that as per arbitration Clause\n   No.27, all disputes or differences or questions or\n   disagreements with respect to construction meaning,\n   operation, effect, interpretation and breach can be referred to\n   first OEC and then to arbitration. It is to note that :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">   i)     Whereas in the instant case when the petitioner had\n   itself abandoned the contract by its letter dated 29.05.2020\n   which had resulted into termination of the contract by ONGC\n   by letter dated 16.07.2020, there cannot be said to be any\n   disputes or differences or disagreements in such facts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">   ii)    Furthermore, the Petitioner in present petition had\n   challenged the decision of ONGC for putting it on holiday\n   period of 2 years which is only a consequence of termination\n   of contract. Thus, in event of abandoning the contract, it is\n   now not open to petitioner to raise grievance about its\n   consequences. Even for the sake of argument also such\n   decision of ONGC can only be regarded as differences between\n   the parties at best and for the same the petitioner has already\n   availed remedy available under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_5\">section 11</a> of Arbitration and\n   Conciliation Act, 1996.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                            Page 18 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">   C/SCA/11391/2020                              JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n\n12.4 In the last, Mr. Khare submitted that as the writ-\napplicant has already invoked the arbitration clause and his\napplication filed under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act is\npending before this Court, this Court may not interfere with\nthe impugned order of termination of contract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">      Analysis :-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">13.

Question (b) should have been first answered\n            as it would go to the root of the matter. The High\n            Court instead considered Question (a) and then chose\n            not to answer Question (b). In our view, the answer to\n            Question (b) is clear.

The\n            interpretation and implementation of a clause in a\n            contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ petition.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">            Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is\n            a question of construction of contract. If a term of a\n            contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the\n            writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226 .</a> We are also unable to\n            agree with the observations of the High Court that the\n            contractor was seeking enforcement of a statutory\n            contract. A contract would not become statutory simply\n            because it is for construction of a public utility and it\n            has been awarded by a statutory body. We are also\n            unable to agree with the observation of the High Court\n            that since the obligations imposed by the contract on\n            the contracting parties come within the purview of the\n            <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_16\">Contract Act</a>, that would not make the contract\n            statutory. Clearly, the High Court fell into an error in\n            coming to the conclusion that the contract in question\n            was statutory in nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">        11.       A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power\n           on a statutory body to enter into contracts in order to\n           enable it to discharge its functions. Dispute arising out\n           of the terms of such contracts or alleged breaches have\n           to be settled by the ordinary principles of law of\n           contract. The fact that one of the parties to the\n           agreement is a statutory or public body will not by\n           itself affect the principles to be applied. The disputes\n           about the meaning of a covenant in a contract or its\n           enforceability have to be determined according to the\n           usual principles of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_17\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of a\n           statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise\n           of statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private\n           parties, have power to contract or deal with property.\n           Such activities may not raise any issue of public law. In\n           the present case, it has not been shown how the\n           contract is statutory. The contract between the parties is\n           in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory\n           contract. The disputes relating to interpretation of the\n           terms and conditions of such a contract could not have\n           been agitated in a petition under Article226 of the\n           Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                              Page 21 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                              JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n            by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the\n            contract.

We are unable to see any substance in the\n          argument that the termination of arrangement without\n          observing the principle of natural justice (audi alteram\n          partem) is void. The termination is not a quasi-judicial\n          act by any stretch of imagination; hence it was not\n          necessary to observe the principles of natural justice. It\n          is not also an executive or administrative act to attract\n          the duty to act fairly. It was - as has been repeatedly\n          urged by Shri Ramaswamy - a matter governed by a\n          contract/agreement between the parties. If the matter is\n          governed by a contract, the writ petition is not\n          maintainable since it is a public law remedy and is not\n          available in private law field, e.g., where the matter is\n          governed by a nonstatutory contract.

The High Court appears to be right in not\n          pronouncing upon any of the several contentions raised\n          in the writ petition by both the parties and in merely\n          reiterating the effect of the order of the Deputy\n          Commissioner made under the proviso to Section 8D(1).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">        16.       Firstly, the contract between the parties is a\n           contract in the realm of private law. It is not a\n           statutory contract. It is governed by the provisions of\n           the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_19\">Contract Act</a> or, maybe, also by certain provisions\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                              Page 22 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                              JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n            of the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_20\">Sale of Goods Act</a>. Any dispute relating to\n            interpretation of the terms and conditions of such a\n            contract cannot be agitated, and could not have been\n            agitated, in a writ petition. That is a matter either for\n            arbitration as provided by the contract or for the civil\n            court, as the case may be. Whether any amount is due\n            to the respondent from the appellant-Government under\n            the contract and, if so, how much and the further\n            question whether retention or refusal to pay any\n            amount by the Government is justified, or not, are all\n            matters which cannot be agitated in or adjudicated\n            upon in a writ petition. The prayer in the writ petition,\n            viz., to restrain the Government from deducting a\n            particular amount from the writ petitioner&#x27;s bill(s) was\n            not a prayer which could be granted by the High Court\n            under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 226.</a> Indeed, the High Court has not\n            granted the said prayer.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1941195\" id=\"span_50\">12.

In\n          our opinion the said contention is not correct and the\n          High Court was wrong in accepting the same. <a href=\"/doc/243421/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n          43</a> empowers the Electricity Board to enter into an\n          arrangement for purchase of electricity on such terms as\n          may be agreed. Section 43A(1) provides that a\n          generating company may enter into a contract for the\n          sale of electricity generated by it with the Electricity\n          Board. As regards the determination of tariff for the\n          sale of electricity by a generating company to the\n          Board, <a href=\"/doc/243421/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 43(1)(2)</a> provides that the tariff shall be\n          determined in accordance with the norms regarding\n          operation and plant-load factor as may be <a href=\"/doc/1941195/\" id=\"a_27\">laid down by</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                              Page 23 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                              JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n            the authority and in accordance with the rates of\n            depreciation and reasonable return and such other\n            factors as may be determined from time to time by the\n            Central Government by a notification in the Official\n            Gazette. These provisions clearly indicate that the\n            agreement can be on such terms as may be agreed by\n            the parties except that the tariff is to be determined in\n            accordance with the provision contained in Section\n            43A(2)     and notifications issued thereunder. Merely\n            because a contract is entered into in exercise of an\n            enabling power conferred by a statute that by itself\n            cannot render the contract a statutory contract. If\n            entering into a contract containing the prescribed terms\n            and conditions is a must under the statute then that\n            contract becomes a statutory contract. If a contract\n            incorporates certain terms and conditions in it which\n            are statutory then the said contract to that extent is\n            statutory. A contract may contain certain other terms\n            and conditions which may not be of a statutory\n            character and which have been incorporated therein as\n            a result of mutual agreement between the parties.\n            Therefore, the PPAs can be regarded as statutory only\n            to the extent that they contain provisions regarding\n            determination of tariff and other statutory requirements\n            of Section43A(2) . Opening and maintaining of an\n            escrow account or an escrow agreement are not the\n            statutory requirements and, therefore, merely because\n            PPAs contemplate maintaining escrow accounts that\n            obligation cannot be regarded as statutory.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">13.

It is a matter governed by\ncontract / agreement between the parties.

This is more so when the\n            modern     trend    is   also    to    examine    the\n            unreasonableness of a term in such contracts where\n            the bargaining power is unequal so that these are\n            not negotiated contracts but standard from contracts\n            between unequals.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                             Page 31 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                  Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"> C/SCA/11391/2020                            JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n    It was then said : -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">            &quot;However, to the extent, challenge is made on the\n            ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 14</a> by alleging that\n            the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or\n            unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also falls\n            within the domain of contractual obligations would\n            not relieve the State of its obligation to comply\n            with the basic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 14.</a> To this\n            extent, the obligation is of a public character\n            invariably in every case irrespective of there being\n            any other right or obligation in addition thereto.

The learned counsel also took us through the paragraph\n    where the Supreme Court has referred to its judgement in\n    <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_79\">Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U. P.</a>, reported in\n    (1991) 1 SCC 212 : (AIR 1991 SC 537). Ultimately, the\n    learned senior counsel pointed out from the observations in\n    paragraph 23 that once the State or an instrumentality of the\n    State is a party of the contract, it has an obligation in law to\n    act fairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of\n    <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and where the State\n    acts in contravention of the abovesaid requirement, a writ\n    Court can issue suitable directions to set right the arbitrary\n    actions. Developing his argument and applying it to the\n    present case, the learned counsel argued that in the writ\n    petition itself the basic prayer was for quashing the &quot;order&quot;\n    dated 2nd June 2003 passed by the Jute Commissioner. The\n    learned counsel further pointed out that once that order was\n    quashed and declared to be illegal and invalid, the necessary\n    relief of payment would automatically follow which was\n    prayed for in prayer clause (G) of the writ petition. The\n    learned counsel pointed out that the said order was per se\n    arbitrary inasmuch as the respondents had no power to\n    withhold a payment against a different lot on the ground that\n    the earlier lot supplied was defective. This, according to the\n    learned counsel, clearly amounted to not only the breach of\n    contract, but an action which is totally arbitrary and without\n    any justification in law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">    20. We have already shown that in the first place this was\n    not an &quot;order&quot; passed. It was merely a communication.

The\n    amount was only &quot;withheld&quot; temporarily which would be\n    clear from the contents of paragraph 3 of the said letter\n    dated 12-9-2003. In that letter itself, there is a clear reference\n    to the matter being settled with Purchase Officer. Not only\n    this, but thereafter also even before the writ petition was\n    filed, the writ petitioner had shown its readiness to settle the\n    matter regarding the payment. We have already pointed out\n    earlier that the matter could have been settled only after the\n    joint inspection of the damaged goods. Therefore, it was clear\n    that there was no finalized action on the part of the original\n    respondents-appellants herein to refuse the payment. Could\n    such action then be, viewed as an arbitrary action where\n    there was clearly an invitation on the part of the State\n    instrumentality to settle the dispute ? In our opinion, this\n    could not be said to a finalized action and therefore, this\n    could not be viewed to be an appropriate case where a\n    remedy could be sought for by the writ petitioner by way of\n    a writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">    21.

The High Court having regard to the facts\n            of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to\n            entertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon\n            itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power.\n            (See <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_83\">Whirlpool Corpn. v.

And this plenary right of the High Court\n            to issue a prerogative writ will not normally be\n            exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other\n            available remedies unless such action of the State or its\n            instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to\n            violate the constitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 14</a> or for\n            other valid and legitimate reasons, for which the Court\n            thinks it necessary to exercise the said jurisdiction.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">    22. Considering this, it would have to be held that though\n    the writ petition is not absolutely barred in the matters of\n    non-statutory contract with the State, the factual situation has\n    to be tested to see whether it should be entertained. There\n    would be a lot of differences between the two concepts of\n    tenability of the petition and the propriety to entertain the\n    same. As has been held by the Supreme Court above, the\n    High Court has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a\n    petition and it is again reiterated that the High Court will not\n    normally exercise as plenary right to the exclusion of other\n    available remedies unless such action of the State or its\n    instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate\n    the constitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 14.</a> We have already\n    pointed out that in this case, it could not be said that there\n    is any unreasonableness on the part of the present appellants.\n    On the other hand, we are of the clear opinion that the writ\n    petitioner, without any justification, straightway rushed to file\n    a writ petition even when there was an invitation to settle\n    the dispute and when no final action was taken by the\n    appellants. There was, in fact, no refusal on the part of the\n    appellants to pay the amount in question. What was done,\n    was &quot;withholding&quot; the amount till there was a joint\n    inspection and till the matters were resolved in between the\n    parties in connection with the damaged goods supplied by the\n    writ petitioners. Thus, in our opinion, the writ petition\n    should not have been entertained firstly because it was a\n    premature writ petition and secondly it pertained to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                              Page 38 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                                    Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n   C/SCA/11391/2020                              JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n      disputed questions of facts which questions we have already\n      shown in the earlier part of the judgement. Undoubtedly,\n      those questions could not have been solved merely on the\n      basis of the affidavit and counter-affidavit. Another reason for\n      not entertaining the writ petition as the availability of the\n      (alternative) remedy of filing the civil suit where all the\n      disputed questions could have been solved by allowing parties\n      to lead the evidence. We are, therefore, not in a position to\n      agree with the learned single Judge and would choose to\n      dismiss the writ petition.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">19.   Thus, the Courts have maintained a distinction between\nthe statutory contracts, on one hand, and non-statutory ones,\non the other. While judicial review was held to be permissible,\nboth as regards the award and cancellation of the contracts of\nthe former category, the same was confined to certain aspects\nin the latter category. If the termination of contract is on the\nground that a party thereto had violated the conditions\ntherefor, such party is invariably required to work out his\nremedies as provided for under the relevant contracts, viz.,\narbitration or civil suit, as the case may be. However, where\nan element of administrative exercise is undertaken and\nexecutive power is exercised, considerations and parameters are\nsomewhat different. The evaluation of such administrative and\nexecutive exercise, which in turn had given rise to the\ncancellation of the contract, would almost be unsusceptible of\nadjudication by a civil court. The reason is that the exercise of\nsuch administrative or executive power is not guided by the\nclauses in the contract. It is traceable to the inherent executive\npowers     of    the State   and   the     only recognised mode               of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                               Page 39 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                     Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n    C/SCA/11391/2020                             JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\nevaluation of such administrative power is judicial review, as\nprovided for under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_86\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_87\">226</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">20.

The principles deducible from the above are:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">      (1) The modern trend         points      to   judicial     restraint       in\n      administrative action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">      (2) The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely\n      reviews the manner in which the decision was made.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">      (3) The court does not have the expertise to correct the\n      administrative decision. If a review of the administrative\n      decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision,\n      without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">      (4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to\n      judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in the\n      realm of contract. Normally speaking, the decision to accept\n      the tender or award the contract is reached by process of\n      negotiations through several tiers. More often than not, such\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                               Page 42 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                         Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n   C/SCA/11391/2020                              JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n      decisions are made qualitatively by experts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      (5) The Government must have freedom of contract. In other\n      words, a fair play in the joints is a necessary concomitant for\n      an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere\n      or quasi-administrative sphere. However, the decision must not\n      only be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of\n      reasonableness (including its other facts pointed out above) but\n      must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or\n      actuated by mala fides.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">      (6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative\n      burden on the administration and lead to increased and\n      unbudgeted expenditure. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">24.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"899938\" id=\"span_111\">In the matter of <a href=\"/doc/899938/\" id=\"a_99\">Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa</a> [(2007)\n14 SCC 517], the Supreme Court has held as under: -</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">       &quot;22. Judicial review of administrative action is intended to\n       prevent arbitrariness, irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and\n       mala fides. Its purpose is to check whether choice or decision\n       is made &quot;lawfully&quot; and not to check whether choice or\n       decision is &quot;sound&quot;. When the power of judicial review is\n       invoked in matters relating to tenders or award of contracts,\n       certain special features should be borne in mind. A contract is\n       a commercial transaction. Evaluating tenders and awarding\n       contracts are essentially commercial functions. Principles of\n       equity and natural justice stay at a distance. If the decision\n       relating to award of contract is bona fide and is in public\n       interest, courts will not, in exercise of power of judicial\n       review, interfere even if a procedural aberration or error in\n       assessment or prejudice to a tenderer, is made out. The\n       power of judicial review will not be permitted to be invoked\n       to protect private interest at the cost of public interest, or to\n       decide contractual disputes. The tenderer or contractor with a\n       grievance can always seek damages in a civil court. Attempts\n       by unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary grievances, wounded\n       pride and business rivalry, to make mountains out of\n       molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some\n       prejudice to self, and persuade courts to interfere by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                               Page 43 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                                     Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n   C/SCA/11391/2020                             JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n      exercising power of judicial review, should be resisted. Such\n      interferences, either interim or final, may hold up public\n      works for years, or delay relief and succour to thousands and\n      millions and may increase the project cost manifold.\n      Therefore, a court before interfering in tender or contractual\n      matters in exercise of power of judicial review, should pose\n      to itself the following questions:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">              (i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by\n              the authority is mala fide or intended to favour\n              someone;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">                                          OR\n              Whether the process adopted or decision made is so\n              arbitrary and irrational that the court can say: &quot;the\n              decision is such that no responsible authority acting\n              reasonably and in accordance with relevant law could\n              have reached&quot;;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">      (ii) Whether public interest is affected.

Cases involving blacklisting or imposition of penal\n      consequences on a tenderer/contractor or distribution of State\n      largesse (allotment of sites/shops, grant of licences,\n      dealerships and franchises) stand on a different footing as\n      they may require a higher degree of fairness in action. &quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">25.

Broadly speaking, the\n      court will examine actions of State if they pertain to the\n      public law domain and refrain from examining them if they\n      pertain to the private law field.

When the State or an\n      instrumentality of the State ventures into the corporate world\n      and purchases the shares of a company, it assumes to itself\n      the ordinary role of a shareholder, and dons the robes of a\n      shareholder, with all the rights available to such a\n      shareholder. There is no reason why the State as a\n      shareholder should be expected to state its reasons when it\n      seeks to change the management, by a resolution of the\n      company, like any other shareholder.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">29.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1732064\" id=\"span_125\">In <a href=\"/doc/1732064/\" id=\"a_108\">Premji Bhai Parmar vs. Delhi Development Authority</a>\n[AIR 1980 SC 738], a petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 32</a> before the\nSupreme Court contending that the surcharge collected by the\nauthority in respect of a flat purchased by the petitioner was\nillegal,    the       petition   was   dismissed   with     the      following\nobservations:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">      &quot;8.  ...petition to this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 32</a> is not a\n      proper remedy nor is this Court a proper forum for\n      reopening the concluded contracts with a view to getting\n      back a part of the purchase price paid and the benefit\n      taken. .....

The general principles which may be culled out from the\naforementioned judgments is that in a case where the contract\nentered into between the State and the person aggrieved is of\na non-statutory character and the relationship is governed\npurely in terms of a contract between the parties, in such\nsituations the contractual obligations are matters of private law\nand a writ would not lie to enforce a civil liability arising\npurely out of a contract. The proper remedy in such cases\nwould be to file a civil suit for claiming damages, injunctions\nor specific performance or such appropriate reliefs in a civil\ncourt. Pure contractual obligation in the absence of any\nstatutory complexion would not be enforceable through a writ.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">32.

The position thus summarised in the aforesaid principles\n      has to be understood in the context of discussion that\n      preceded which we have pointed out above. As per this, no\n      doubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability of the\n      writ petition even in contractual matters or where there are\n      disputed questions of fact or even when monetary claim is\n      raised. At the same time, discretion lies with the High Court\n      which under certain circumstances, it can refuse to exercise.\n      It also follows that under the following circumstances,\n      &quot;normally&quot;, the Court would not exercise such a discretion:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">      69.1.

Further, the legal position which emerges from various\n   judgments     of    this   Court    dealing     with   different\n   situations/aspects relating to contracts entered into by the\n   State/public authority with private parties, can be summarised\n   as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">   70.1. At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts\n   purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the\n   obligations of fairness.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">   70.2. State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual\n   field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practise\n   some discriminations.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">   70.3. Even in cases where question is of choice or\n   consideration of competing claims before entering into the\n   field of contract, facts have to be investigated and found\n   before the question of a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 14</a> of the\n   Constitution could arise. If those facts are disputed and\n   require assessment of evidence the correctness of which can\n   only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidence,\n   involving examination and cross-examination of witnesses, the\n   case could not be conveniently or satisfactorily decided in\n   proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. In such\n   cases the Court can direct the aggrieved party to resort to\n   alternate remedy of civil suit, etc.\n\n\n   70.4. Writ jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 226</a> of\n   the Constitution was not intended to facilitate avoidance of\n   obligation voluntarily incurred.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">   70.5. Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid contractual\n   obligation. Occurrence of commercial difficulty, inconvenience\n   or hardship in performance of the conditions agreed to in the\n   contract can provide no justification in not complying with\n   the terms of contract which the parties had accepted with\n   open eyes. It cannot ever be that a licensee can work out the\n   licence if he finds it profitable to do so: and he can challenge\n   the conditions under which he agreed to take the licence, if\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                           Page 51 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                            JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n   he finds it commercially inexpedient to conduct his business.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">   70.6. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained of,\n   the party complaining of such breach may sue for specific\n   performance of the contract, if contract is capable of being\n   specifically performed. Otherwise, the party may sue for\n   damages.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">   70.7. Writ can be issued where there is executive action\n   unsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation there\n   is denial of equality before law or equal protection of law or\n   if it can be shown that action of the public authorities was\n   without giving any hearing and violation of principles of\n   natural justice after holding that action could not have been\n   taken without observing principles of natural justice.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">   70.8. If the contract between private party and the\n   State/instrumentality and/or agency of the State is under the\n   realm of a private law and there is no element of public law,\n   the normal course for the aggrieved party, is to invoke the\n   remedies provided under ordinary civil law rather than\n   approaching the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 226</a> of the\n   Constitution of India and invoking its extraordinary\n   jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">   70.9. The distinction between public law and private law\n   element in the contract with the State is getting blurred.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">   However, it has not been totally obliterated and where the\n   matter falls purely in private field of contract, this Court has\n   maintained the position that writ petition is not maintainable.\n   The dichotomy between public law and private law rights and\n   remedies would depend on the factual matrix of each case\n   and the distinction between the public law remedies and\n   private law field, cannot be demarcated with precision. In\n   fact, each case has to be examined, on its facts whether the\n   contractual relations between the parties bear insignia of\n   public element. Once on the facts of a particular case it is\n   found that nature of the activity or controversy involves\n   public law element, then the matter can be examined by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                           Page 52 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n   C/SCA/11391/2020                             JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n      High Court in writ petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 226</a> of the\n      Constitution of India to see whether action of the State\n      and/or instrumentality or agency of the State is fair, just and\n      equitable or that relevant factors are taken into consideration\n      and irrelevant factors have not gone into the decision-making\n      process or that the decision is not arbitrary.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">      70.10. Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen,\n      in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable\n      right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may\n      render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the\n      requirements of due consideration of a legitimate expectation\n      forms part of the principle of non-arbitrariness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">      70.11. The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes\n      falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be\n      more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be\n      relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies\n      provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes. &quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">34.   The principle of law discernible from the aforesaid\ndecision is that in contractual matter, where disputed questions\nof fact have been raised, there cannot be any absolute bar to\nthe maintainability of the writ petition. The High Court may\nbe justified in exercising its discretion only in a case when the\ncontracting party is able to demonstrate it seeks to invoke\npublic law remedy in contradistinction to provide remedy\nsimplicitor under the contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">35.   A governmental contract, even if commercial in nature,\ninvolves, broadly speaking, four stages. The first stage relates\nto the floating of tenders by publishing notice inviting tenders.\nAt this stage, the authority concerned is required to formulate\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                              Page 53 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                    Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n   C/SCA/11391/2020                                         JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\nthe terms and conditions subject to which the tenders would\nbe invited and also the terms and conditions of the contract,\nwhich, if entered into, govern the parties. These terms and\nconditions will obviously include all the legibility criteria for a\nperson to participate in the tender process. After the notice\ninviting tender is published and the tenders are received, the\nsecond stage of such a contract commences. This stage involves\nthe process of taking of the decision to allot the contract or\nnot to allot the contract at all and cancel the entire process.\nThis stage would include the selection of the person or the\nparty to whom the contract shall be allotted. This stage ends\nwith the allotment of the contract or with the decision not to\nallot the contract at all and cancel the entire tender process.\nThe third stage of the contract essentially covers the stage of\nperformance          of   the     contract.     This   stage       would         include\ncommencement of the performance of the allotted contract and\nwould, normally, end with the completion of the allotted\ncontract. During this stage, there may arise the question of\nbreach of the contract, because of non-fulfillment of the terms\nand conditions of the contract by either party to the contract.\nThe   fourth         stage   of    such    a    contract      arises,      when,        on\ncompletion of his part of the contract, the contractor or\nsupplier raises his demand for making payment of his bills.\nThis fourth stage can, however, be divided into two categories.\nThere may be a case, where the amount demanded is not\ndisputed and yet the dues of the contractor are not paid\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                     Page 54 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                                Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n   C/SCA/11391/2020                          JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\ncompelling thereby the contractor to seek avenues for obtaining\npayment of his dues. In this fourth stage, there may, however,\nbe a case, where the correctness of the demand for payment\nraised by the contractor is disputed, denied or challenged by\nthe authority, who had allotted the contract. In such a case,\ntoo, the contractor may be driven to take recourse to such\navenues as may be open to him, in law, for the purpose of\nenabling him to obtain his dues in terms of the demand that\nhe may have made.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"884513\" id=\"span_144\">36.   It may, now, be pointed out that at the first stage of a\ncontract, which requires the authorities concerned to formulate\nthe terms and conditions subject to which the tenders would\nbe invited or the contract would be allotted, many factors are\ntaken into account. The decision as to what terms shall be\nincluded in the tender is really a policy decision, for, it is the\nauthority issuing the notice inviting tender, which is the best\njudge to determine as to what terms and conditions would be\nrequired for successful completion of the work or the project\nconcerned. Thus, it is, primarily, for the authority issuing the\nNOA to decide what particular terms and conditions should be\nincorporated in the NOA. However, when the invitation to\ntender is floated, the second stage, which consists of the\nprocess of selection of the person for awarding the contract,\ncommences and this process comes to an end, when a decision\neither awarding the contract or cancelling the entire tender\nprocess is taken. The decision to award the contract is not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">                            Page 55 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n    C/SCA/11391/2020                                     JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\nopen to judicial review; but the decision making process,\nwhich leads to the ultimate decision, is, according to the law\n<a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_125\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/884513/\" id=\"a_126\">TATA Cellular v.

[AIR 1993\nSC 393], the Apex Court has made it clear that though the\ndecision to award a contract is not open to judicial review, the\ndecision-making process, which leads to the ultimate decision,\nis, indeed, open to judicial review provided that there is an\nelement of public interest involved in the case requiring a\nreview by the Court of the administrative decision to allot the\ncontract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">37.    To put it differently, while settling the terms to be\nincorporated          in   the   invitation     to   tender,      the     authorities\nconcerned must have complete freedom, for, the terms of the\ntender are in the realm of the freedom to contract and it is for\nthe authorities concerned to decide as to what would be the\nterms of the contract. But when the authorities concerned\naward the contract, the decision making process, leading to the\ndecision to allot the contract, gets open to judicial review\nprovided that there is an element of public interest involved in\nthe case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_147\">38.     What may be further noted is that at the first and the\nsecond stage of the contracts, when the government or any of\nits instrumentalities sets up the terms and conditions of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                     Page 56 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                                               Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n    C/SCA/11391/2020                                      JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\ncontract or takes a decision to allot the contract, it acts purely\nin its executive capacity and its action is, therefore, open to\njudicial    review,      though   in     a    limited     way,       as     indicated\nhereinabove. However, when the third stage is reached and a\ncontract      is      entered   into    by         the   government            or      its\ninstrumentality, on the one hand, and the contractor, on the\nother, the parties are no longer governed by Constitutional\nprovisions, but by the terms of the contract. Hence, when a\nState, purporting to act within the field allotted to it under the\nterms and conditions of a contract, performs an act, the rights\nand obligations of the parties would be, ordinarily, governed\nby the law that governs the terms and conditions of the\ncontract. The mere fact that one of the parties to such a\ncontract is the State or its instrumentality will not make a\ncontract amenable to writ jurisdiction.

Our aforesaid discussion, as regards the maintainability\nof this writ application, may be summarized thus:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">       [1] Where the contract entered into between the State\n       and the person aggrieved is non-statutory and purely\n       contractual, but such contract has been cancelled on a\n       ground de hors any of the terms of the contract, and\n       which is per se violative of Article14 of the Constitution,\n       the High Court in such case can exercise its jurisdiction\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 226</a> and the writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 226</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                   Page 57 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                                              Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11391/2020                           JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n    by aggrieved person would be maintainable.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">    [2]      The Courts have maintained distinction between\n    statutory contracts, on one hand, and non-statutory ones,\n    on the other. While judicial review was held to be\n    permissible, both as regards award and cancellation of\n    the contracts of the former category, the same was\n    confined to certain aspects in the latter category. If the\n    termination of contract is on the ground that a party\n    thereto had violated the conditions therefor, such party is\n    invariably required to work out his remedies as provided\n    for under the relevant contracts, viz., arbitration or civil\n    suit, as the case may be. However, where an element of\n    administrative exercise is undertaken and executive power\n    is exercised, considerations and parameters are somewhat\n    different.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">    [3] Generally, the Court should not exercise its writ\n    jurisdiction to enforce the contractual obligation. The\n    primary purpose of a writ mandamus, is to protect and\n    establish rights and to impose a corresponding imperative\n    duty existing in law. It is designed to promote justice ( ex\n    debito justiceiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is at\n    the discretion of the Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">    [4] The discretion must be exercised by the Court on\n    grounds of public policy, public interest and public good.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                           Page 58 of 60</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                                Downloaded on : Sun Aug 22 12:43:00 IST 2021</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">   C/SCA/11391/2020                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 30/07/2021\n\n\n\n      The writ is equitable in nature and thus, its issuance is\n      governed by equitable principles.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">      [5] The prime consideration for the issuance of the said\n      writ is, whether or not substantial justice will be\n      promoted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">40.      As     noted   above   the      writ-applicant      has       filed      an\nappropriate application under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act\nbefore this Court for appointment of arbitrator. Prima facie we\nare not convinced with the case put up by the Corporation\nthat the writ-applicant is not entitled to invoke the arbitration\nclause. We fail to understand why the Corporation is reluctant\nto go for arbitration. On one hand, the writ-applicant has been\nbanned from all further operations for a period of two years\nand on the other the Corporation does not even want to go for\narbitration. However, it shall be open for the writ-applicant to\npursue his <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 11</a> application pending before this Court. If\nultimately      the   application   is    allowed     and      arbitrator          is\nappointed, then all the disputes between the parties shall be\nresolved through the mode of arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">41.   Prima facie we do not find any palpable or material\ninfirmity going to the root of the matter warranting immediate\ninterference by this Court.
