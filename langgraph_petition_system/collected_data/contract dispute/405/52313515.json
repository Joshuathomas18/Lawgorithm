The parties wanted to submit the\n       disputes to arbitration in India. This is clear from Clause\n       Tenth which makes no reference to Iraqi laws or Iraqi\n       procedure or Iraqi venue.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       38.    We are fortified in this conclusion of ours by the letter\n       of the CMD who acting on clause Tenth referred the matter to\n       the Arbitration Committee by appointing his nominee\n       arbitrator. The clause Tenth was very much before him when\n       wrote the letter dated 11.1.2001.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       39.

There are four good reasons why we should prefer\n       clause Tenth to Clause 45, firstly, it is later in point of time.\n       Clause Tenth was inserted in the contract in 1982 while\n       clause 45 was printed in 1980. Secondly, clause Tenth is\n       typed while clause 45 is printed. It is settled law that where in\n       the printed matter some alteration is desired by typing the\n       typed matter supersedes the printed matter to that extent.\n       [See Mool Chand Vs. Associated Agencies AIR 1942 Mad.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                            Page 9 of 34</span>\n        139; Ratilal Vs. dalmia Cement AIR 1943 Bom. 229].\n       Thirdly, clause 45 lands us in absurdities. Counsel suggests\n       that the parties go to Iraq and find out two arbitrators--men\n       well versed in Iraqi laws and procedure. They in turn will\n       appoint a â€•Chairmanâ€–--again a man of Iraqi law. The Iraqi\n       laws will be applied. The sittings will be in Iraq. Iraqi courts\n       will have jurisdiction. Iraqi lawyers will have to be engaged.\n       The award will be passed according to Iraqi laws. God\n       knows how the award of a totalitarian country will be\n       enforced in India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">       53.    Fourthly, clause 45 contemplates international\n       arbitration when one party is a foreign national. Therefore,\n       it makes provisions in favour of Iraqi laws. Clause Tenth\n       deals with domestic arbitration where both parties are\n       Indians. To apply clause 45 to a case where both parties are\n       Indians is to fit somehow a square peg in a round hole.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">       54.    Clause Tenth contemplates nothing of the kind. It is a\n       straight forward arbitration agreement to which Indian\n       substantive and procedural laws applies. Both parties are\n       Indians and they intended arbitration to be governed by their\n       own laws. That is what CMD thought. By virtue of the\n       authority vested in him he appointed an Indian arbitrator.\n       His letter dated 11.1.2001 is well worded. It seems to have\n       been drafted by a lawyer. It uses the word â€•whereasâ€– twice.\n       â€•Whereasâ€– means a recital of past events. It is a familiar\n       term known to draftsman when he drafts deeds of indenture. It\n       is a formal deed of reference. The recital speaks of past\n       outstanding disputes and the need to resolve them by\n       arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">       55.    On the whole we are satisfied that we are on a firm\n       ground when we vote in favour of clause Tenth Clause 45 is\n       impractical, impossible and its application will lead to absurd\n       results and injustice. Absurdity in construction of contracts\n       must always be avoided.          We have to consider the\n       consequences which will follow the adoption of clause 45.\n       With regret we decline the invitation of Mr. Seth, learned\n       counsel for NBCC, to hold our sittings in Iraq. The\n       acceptance of clause 45 will expose the Tribunal to ridicule.\n       It leads to results which are contrary to the legitimate objects\n       of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">               xxxx          xxxx          xxxx           xxxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">       59.    In international commercial arbitration at least one of\n       the parties is a national of any country other than India or a\n       body corporate which is incorporated in any country other\n       than India. [Section 2(f) of the Act]. To such an arbitration\n       under <a href=\"/doc/104962841/\" id=\"a_2\">section 28(b)</a> the foreign law, for example Iraqi law,\n       shall apply if so designated by the parties as applicable to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                           Page 10 of 34</span>\n        substance of the dispute. Therefore, clause 45 applied to\n       NBCC, an Indian corporate body when it entered into a\n       contract with an Iraqi client. The parties agreed that the law\n       applicable will be Iraqi law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">       60.    This is not the case here. Why should the arbitration\n       be held on a foreign soil? Why should it be based in Iraq\n       when parties are Indians? Why should Iraqi laws apply?\n       The Act says Indian law shall apply to Indian arbitration.\n       There is no satisfactory answer to these questions. Parties\n       did not agree that a foreign legal system will govern them\n       when after the completion of the work they have nothing to do\n       with Iraq. We put clause 45 out of our way as wholly\n       inapplicable to our case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">       61.    Clause 45 is a non-domestic agreement. Clause Tenth\n       is a domestic agreement. Domestic is applicable while non-\n       domestic has no application to this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">               xxxx         xxxx          xxxx          xxxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">       65.    CMDs come and CMDs go. But NBCC goes on\n       forever. It is a body corporate. It has a perpetual succession\n       and a common seal. [See <a href=\"/doc/675604/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 34</a> of the Companies Act,\n       1956]. CMD acts in the name of NBCC. The referring order\n       dated 11.1.2001 says:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       â€•Therefore, I A.K. Sarkar, Chairman-cum-Managing\n       Director, National Building Construction Corporation Ltd.\n       New Delhi in pursuance of the same, do hereby nominate Shri\n       V.K.

Therefore, if the action impugned is not outside the\n       scope of his duties CMD&#x27;s order is binding on NBCC. He is\n       no ordinary director. IN his own person he represents the\n       company. His order has a sanctity and a legal validity. For\n       years NBCC had â€•dillydalliedâ€– over the appointment of its\n       arbitrator, Antia complained to CMD. Impressed by the\n       justice of the complaint, CMD appointed his company&#x27;s\n       nominee arbitrator. He only did his duty.

On his view the Indian\n       Law will apply. If this is so how can NBCC now argue to the\n       contrary. His inclination in favour of the Indian Law is\n       apparent from the fact that Mr. Anand, his nominee, was\n       profoundly and happily ignorant of Iraqi Laws. If CMD&#x27;s\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                         Page 11 of 34</span>\n        view had been in favour of Iraq he would have appointed an\n       expert of Iraqi laws. It seems to us that both parties were\n       clear in their minds that arbitration will be held in India\n       according to the Indian Law. The truth is Iraqi Law is a red\n       herring and non-issue.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">               xxx           xxxx          xxxx           xxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       70.

NBCC did construction work for the Iraqi Republic.\n       They had their office, staff, employees there for conducting\n       business. They left Iraq years ago. Iraqi courts have no\n       jurisdiction over the parties now. If Iraqi Government today\n       has a claim against NBCC they must follow their defendant to\n       his place of residence. NBCC is a resident Indian Company.\n       The aggrieved party must come to India. It is ridiculous to\n       argue that Antia should go to Iraq to commence arbitration\n       proceedings against NBCC where neither the contractor nor\n       sub-contractor are stationed in Iraq.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">       78.    The fundamental principle is that the court cannot\n       entertain an action against a non-resident defendant who is\n       absent in the foreign country.

Both in time and space the situation has completely\n       changed. What was true is 1982 in Iraq is not true in 2002 in\n       India. Iraqi laws were relevant in 1982. But the Iraqi system\n       of law does not determine the choice of law once for all for\n       every situation. Now the Iraqi laws are out of place.

It will be helpful if we compare and contrast clause\n       Tenth with Clause 45. Clause 45 deals with International\n       Commercial Arbitration.           International Commercial\n       Arbitration can take place in India or outside India. Under\n       clause 2(1)(f)(iv) it is an International Commercial\n       Arbitration as one of the parties is the government of a\n       foreign country. Clause 45 says that Iraqi Law shall apply to\n       the contract. Clause Tenth deals with domestic arbitration\n       and applies internal law and not foreign law. Here both\n       parties are Indian companies. Clause Tenth is a replica of\n       Clause 45 minus the Iraqian Law and the foreign element. It\n       has no foreign complexion.          It has no geographical\n       connection with Iraq. Clause 45 is part of an Iraqi contract\n       while Clause Tenth is part of Indian Contract.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">       82.

Mr. Seth, learned counsel for NBCC, urges that we\n       should harmonise the two clauses. It is no possible to do so\n       because these clauses are separate and deal with different\n       situations. By harmonizing the two we destroy the Tenth\n       Clause, its separate identity and its distinctive Indian flavor.\n       Carefully crafted it saves domestic arbitration for resolution\n       of disputes between two Indian parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\n       Applicable Law\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">       84.    Our conclusion is that the seat of arbitration shall be\n       Delhi India in this case and the law applicable shall be\n       Indian Law as both parties are Indians. It is not open to the\n       parties to make a contract that Iraqi laws will apply to them\n       and thereby oust the jurisdiction of the Indian Courts. Such\n       an agreement under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_4\">sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_5\">28</a> of the Indian\n       Contract Act is void and against public policy. An arbitration\n       between two Indian parties based abroad and governed by\n       Iraqi law is an unacceptable proposition propounded by\n       counsel for NBCC.

In the absence of a\n\nclear or specific indication that the main contract in entirety including\n\nthe arbitration agreement was intended to be made applicable to the\n\nsub-contract between the parties, and as the wording of the sub-\n\ncontract discloses only an intention to incorporate by reference the\n\nterms of the main contract relating to the execution of the work as\n\ncontrasted from the dispute resolution, we are of the view that the\n\narbitration clause in the main contract did not form part of the sub-\n\ncontract between the parties..........This is in view of the principle that\n\nwhen the document to which a general reference is made, contains an\n\narbitration clause whose provisions are clearly inapt or inapplicable\n\nwith reference to the contract between the parties, it would be assumed\n\nor inferred that there was no intention to incorporate the arbitration\n\nclause from the referred document.â€–</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">13.      Assuming without admitting, that the sub-contract contained an\n\narbitration clause, Mr. Kaul and Ms. Rautray submitted that there could\n\nnot be a partial incorporation of the main contract. According to them,\n\nif all provisions of the main contract were deemed to have been\n\nincorporated in the sub-contract executed between NBCC and AEPL,\n\nthen the applicable law would be Iraqi law and the venue for arbitration\n\nwould be Iraq and, consequently, the Award would be liable to be set\n\naside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                      Page 16 of 34</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_66\"> 14.

They further submitted that AEPL could not take\n\nadvantage of <a href=\"/doc/85586/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 18</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 as there was no\n\nacknowledgment in writing of AEPLâ€Ÿs claims by NBCC within the\n\nperiod of limitation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">15.

In the instant case, Clause\n       12(3) has been set out hereinabove. If we recount the facts of the case,\n       it transpires that invoking the said clause, the Petitioner had written a\n       letter dated 23.5.2002 to the Opposite Party asking for settlement of\n       the disputes and differences. A reminder was also sent on 18.6.2002.\n       A reply to that effect was sent to the Petitioner not by the Chief\n       General Manager, OSCOM, but by the General Manager, OSCOM.\n       Thereafter, the Petitioner received on 16.10.2002 a reply dated\n       10.10.2002 in which there is a clear stand taken by the Head of\n       OSCOM, who is the Chief General Manager that the matter may be\n       referred to arbitration. That was one of the options given to the\n       Petitioner. The Petitioner immediately on 17.10.2002 agreed to the\n       proposal for referring the matter to the arbitration in accordance with\n       the said Act of 1996 and proposed the venue to be in Mumbai.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">       Thereafter the Petitioner sent another communication dated 21.4.2003\n       further reiterating the proposal for referring the dispute under the\n       said work order to arbitration and the Petitioner suggested the name\n       of Justice Mrs. K.K. Baam (Retd.) as the sole Arbitrator and requested\n       the Opposite Party to confirm the same within thirty days. The\n       Opposite Party vide its letter dated 13.5.2003 replied by saying that\n       the suggestion of appointing Justice Mrs. K.K. Baam as the sole\n       Arbitrator is not acceptable to it. In the aforesaid sequence of events,\n       this Court is of the opinion that there is provision for arbitration in\n       Clause 12.3 and the Opposite Party has admitted the existence of the\n       same by its letter dated 10.10.2002.â€–\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                           Page 18 of 34</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\"> 18.    Mr. Markanda contended that NBCCâ€Ÿs argument that Iraqi law\n\nwas the governing law and that Iraq was the venue of arbitration, was\n\ndevoid of merits.

In this connection, he relied upon the reasoning contained in\n\nthe majority Arbitral Tribunalâ€Ÿs order dated 13th May, 2002 which has\n\nalready been reproduced hereinabove.          He also pointed out that as\n\nClause 10 was a typed clause, it would prevail over Clause 45 which\n\nwas a printed clause in the GCC. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1226876\" id=\"span_20\">In this context, he drew attention of\n\nthis Court to a judgment of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1226876/\" id=\"a_13\">M.K.

In the alternative, Mr. Markanda submitted that subjecting Indian\n\nparties to Iraqi laws would amount to doing â€žviolenceâ€Ÿ to the terms of\n\nthe contract.

In many cases, however, one\n       or other of the parties will seek to imply a term from the\n       wording of a particular contract and the facts and\n       circumstances surrounding it. The court will be prepared to\n       imply a term if there arises from the language of the contract\n       itself, and the circumstances under which it is entered into, an\n       inference that the parties must have intended the stipulation\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                           Page 20 of 34</span>\n        in question. An implication of this nature may be made in two\n       situations: first, where it is necessary to give business efficacy\n       to the contract, and, secondly, where the term implied\n       represents the obvious, but unexpressed, intention of the\n       parties. These two criteria often overlap and, in many cases,\n       have been applied cumulatively, although it is submitted that\n       they are, in fact, alternative grounds.

A term will be implied if it is\n       necessary, in the business sense, to give efficacy to the\n       contract. The general principle of law was thus stated by\n       Bowen L.J. in the Moorcock:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">              â€•Now, an implied warranty, or as it is called, a\n              covenant in law, as distinguished from an express\n              contract or express warranty, really is in all cases\n              founded upon the presumed intention of the parties,\n              and upon reason. The implication which the law\n              draws from what must obviously have been the\n              intention of the parties, the law draws with the object\n              of giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing\n              such a failure of consideration as cannot have been\n              within the contemplation of either side, and I believe if\n              one were to take all the cases, and there are many, of\n              implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be\n              found that in all of them the law is raising an\n              implication from the presumed intention of the parties\n              with the object of giving to the transaction such\n              efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all\n              events it should have.â€–\n\n       In this situation, although there is an apparently complete\n       bargain, the courts are willing to add a term on the ground\n       that without it the contract will not work.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">21.

The terms of a\n       contract may have to be ascertained by reference to more\n       than one document. Ascertaining which documents constitute\n       the contractual documents and in what, if any, order of\n       priority they should be read is a problem encountered in\n       many commercial transactions, particularly those involving\n       shipping and construction. This issue has to be determined\n       by applying the usual principles of construction and\n       attempting to infer the parties&#x27; intentions by means of an\n       objective assessment of the evidence. This may make\n       questions of incorporation irrelevant if for example it is clear\n       that the contractual documents in question are entirely\n       separate and no intention to incorporate the terms of one in\n       the other can be established. However, the contractual\n       document defining and imposing the performance obligations\n       may be found to incorporate another document which\n       contains an arbitration agreement. If there is a dispute about\n       the performance obligations, that dispute may need to be\n       decided according to the arbitration provisions of that other\n       document. This very commonly occurs when the principal\n       contractual document refers to standard form terms\n       containing an arbitration agreement. However the standard\n       form wording may not be apt for the contract in which the\n       parties seeks to incorporate it, or the reference may be to\n       another contract between parties at least one of whom is\n       different. In these circumstances it may be possible to argue\n       that the purported incorporation of the arbitration agreement\n       is ineffective.

In Trade Maritime\n       Corp v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association (Bermuda)\n       Ltd, (The â€•Athenaâ€–) No. 2 the court referred in particular to\n       the stricter approach which requires specific reference to the\n       arbitration     agreement     as     being     applicable    in\n       charterparty/bills of lading cases. It has also been applied in\n       other areas, notably reinsurance contracts and construction\n       contracts. In principle however the rationale for requiring\n       specific words of incorporation, notably the absence of\n       knowledge of the terms of another contract between different\n       parties and the need for adjustment of the terms as written, is\n       not limited to those situations.

We do not agree. It is for\n       this reason alone that we have given the complete history of\n       the negotiations in between the parties. The things do not\n       seem to have settled even by 19-1-2005 but that would be for\n       the Arbitral Tribunal to decide. We only observe, at this\n       stage, that the claim of the respondent cannot be said to have\n       become dead firstly because of the settlement or because of\n       lapse of limitation. What is the effect of MoU dated 19-1-\n       2005; was the respondent justified in repudiating the said\n       MoU; and what is the effect of repudiation thereof on the\n       earlier agreement dated 27-4-1994 would be for the Arbitral\n       Tribunal to decide. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1954535\" id=\"span_42\">In <a href=\"/doc/1954535/\" id=\"a_40\">Groupe Chimique Tunisien SA v.\n       Southern Petrochemicals Industries Corpn.

The work order (sub-contract), relevant portions of which\n       have been extracted in para 5 above, shows that the intention\n       of the parties was not to incorporate the main contract\n       (between the PW Department and respondent) in entirety into\n       the sub contract. The use of the words &quot;This sub-contract\n       shall be carried out on the terms and conditions as applicable\n       to main contract&quot; in the work order would indicate an\n       intention that only the terms and conditions in the main\n       contract relating to execution of the work, were adopted as a\n       part of the sub-contract between respondent and appellant,\n       and not the parts of the main contract which did not relate to\n       execution of the work, as for example the terms relating to\n       payment of security deposit, mobilization advance, the\n       itemised rates for work done, payment, penalties for breach\n       etc., or the provision for dispute resolution by arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_97\">34.    In the present case, the incorporation clause did not only refer to\n\ncertain terms and conditions relating to execution of work.

However, in my view, there cannot be partial incorporation of the\n\nterms of the main contract executed between the parties. Consequently,\n\nClause 10 of the main contract has to be read harmoniously with\n\nClauses 17 and 45 of the GCC. In my opinion, the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nhas erred in law in holding that Clauses 17 and 45 of the GCC were\n\ninapplicable to the sub-contract. The Arbitral Tribunal being a creature\n\nof the contract cannot hold certain terms of the contract as inapplicable\n\nor void. Moreover, as in the present case there is no irreconcilable\n\ninconsistency in clauses between Clauses 10 and 45, there is no\n\nquestion of applicability of the rule of construction as <a href=\"/doc/20317/\" id=\"a_45\">laid down by</a> the\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1226876/\" id=\"a_46\">M.K.

Further, Mr. Markandaâ€Ÿs reference to passages Chitty on\n\nContracts, 29th Edition is untenable in law as no Court can imply any\n\nterm in a Court where the parties have entered into a carefully drafted\n\nwritten contract containing detailed terms agreed between them.\n\nMoreover, the term sought to be implied by Mr. Markanda is clearly\n\ncontrary to the terms explicitly provided in the contract executed\n\nbetween the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">37.    Mr. Markandaâ€Ÿs reliance upon <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 28(1)(a)</a> of Act, 1996 is\n\nalso misconceived on facts as the said Section only applies where the\n\nvenue of arbitration is in India. Since in the present case Clause 45 of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">O.M.P. 46/2003 &amp; 480/2003                                     Page 32 of 34</span>\n GCC clearly stipulates that the venue of arbitration shall be Iraq,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 28(1)(a)</a> of Act, 1996 can offer no assistance to AEPL.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">38.    I am further of the opinion that the arbitration clause in the main\n\ncontract is neither inapt nor inapplicable to the sub-contract.              For\n\ninstance, if during the execution of the contract principal employer\n\nraised a dispute on account of defective work done by the sub-\n\ncontractor, then not only would the arbitration be held between SCCIP\n\nand NBCC in Iraq according to Iraqi law but NBCC could also initiate\n\narbitration proceedings against AEPL. If in this scenario, arbitration\n\nbetween NBCC and AEPL is directed to be held in India, according to\n\nIndian law, it is quite possible that the two arbitral tribunals on similar\n\ndisputes would reach a different conclusion. The above illustration\n\nwould also show that Clauses 17 and 45 of GCC are of importance and\n\nare applicable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"633347\" id=\"span_50\">In fact, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/633347/\" id=\"a_49\">National Thermal Power\n\nCorporation Vs.
