The brief contention of the petitioner is that the\n\naccused No.1 is a Company (M/s Sri.Avantika Contractors (I)\n\nLimited,) Represented by its Managing Director along with\n\naccused No.2-K.Andrew Vincent/Proprietor and accused No.3-\n\nPrasanth Konda Reddy/the then Project Manager of Company\n\n(M/s Sri.Avantika Contractors (I) Ltd.) in the project at\n\nKudgi.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">      3.    Respondent      No.2-National        Thermal    Power\n\nCorporation (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;NTPC&#x27; for short) is a\n\npublic sector engaging business of generation of electricity\n\nand allied activities.   It awarded the work of Site Levelling\n\nand Infrastructure Works of packaging, for its Kudgi Super\n\nThermal Power Project Stage-I (3x800 MW), Karnataka, to\n\naccused No.1-Company. On 02.04.2012 the agreement was\n\nexecuted with the work value being Rs.154,34,54,426/- and\n\nthe period for completion of work was 30 months i.e. starting\n\ndate as 27.02.2012 and completion date is 26.08.2014.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      4.    Thereafter, by amendment-I, vide letter dated\n\n18.11.2013, the contract value was increased to Rs.183.54\n\ncrores. Then, again by Amendment-II, the contract value was\n\nfurther increased to Rs.189.03 crores, vide letter dated\n\n28.02.2014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      5.    It is further contended that due to various\n\nreasons, such as, delay in handing over the site by NTPC to\n\naccused No.1/Company, free from full encumbrances and\n\nobstructions,   agitation    by       land   owners,   release   of\n\nconstruction drawings, etc., again on 09.11.2013, NTPC\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\ngranted an extension of time for six months upto February\n\n2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">        6.   Then,      dispute    arose   between     the    parties\n\nregarding the initial levels and quantities in the RA bills,\n\nwhich led to termination of contract by NTPC on 24.03.2014,\n\nwhich was within the period of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">        7.   As per the contract, Dispute Settlement Clause\n\nthe several disputes that arose, were referred to the Dispute\n\nResolution Board (DRB). As the decision of said DRB was not\n\nacceptable to both the parties, the parties resorted to the\n\nClause i.e. agreed to resolve the dispute through Arbitration,\n\nwhich was a Three Member Arbitration Tribunal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">        8.   There are claims made by accused No.1 and by\n\nNTPC, then relevant issues were framed. The Arbitral Award\n\ndated 07.07.2017 came to be passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">        9.   It   is   further    contended   that   during   Arbitral\n\nproceedings and even before the Dispute Resolution Board,\n\none specific bill, which is Running Account Bill No.15 (RA Bill\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">15), was the primary issue that was in dispute. Both parties\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\nproduced detailed evidence before the Tribunal. The Tribunal\n\nafter discussing in very great detail, both these disputed\n\ndocuments, the signatories to it, the communications in\n\nrespect of this between both the parties and also the fact of\n\nthe authorized signatory of the accused No.1/Company by\n\nthe petitioner herein, who has signed one of the documents\n\nalong with the representative of NTPC, the Tribunal came to\n\nthis conclusion:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;Page 101 of Arbitral Award at Ann.D:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      &quot;227. Based on the various observations and\n      findings of the Arbitral Tribunal in this regard,\n      the logical conclusion to which the Arbitral\n      tribunal is driven is that the documents Book-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      as to Book-16 signed by Mr.Praveen and\n      Mr.Augustine      cannot    be   construed    as    a\n      proper document for the reasons recorded\n      earlier.....\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      228. Regarding the documents in Rejoinder\n      Vol.3/1 to 3/10, the Arbitral has already\n      observed that the Vol.3/1 to 3/6 are signed\n      by   the     authorized    representative    of    the\n      claimant and it is also signed by Mr.Praveen\n      along with other officers of the respondent\n      and the claimant. From this the Arbitral\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\n\n      Tribunal     finds     that     the      documents      in\n      Rejoinder Vol.3/1 to 3/6 can be certainly held\n      to be the documents which are to be relied\n      upon.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">Hence,   the     above     Arbitral       Tribunal   found   it    just   and\n\nappropriate to award the balance unpaid specified quantity to\n\naccused No.1/Company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">      10.   The said award was challenged by NTPC before\n\nthe High Court of Delhi in O.M.P.(COMM).370/2017 and the\n\nsaid petition is partly allowed, upholding the claims awarded\n\nin favour of accused No.1/Company with respect to four of\n\nthe claims and partially another claim. As far as two sets of\n\nrecord of measurements of Original Ground Level data relied\n\nby each party and the issue of payment towards RA Bill 15,\n\nthe High Court held that it was not open for High Court to\n\nsubstitute the said findings, more particularly when as per\n\nthe settled law. The High Court of Delhi, affirmed the finding\n\nof the Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">      11.   After the award dated 07.07.2017, the FIR,\n\nimpugned charge sheet and cognizance order came to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                8</span>\n\n\n\n\nregistered on 27.08.2017, which is about two months after\n\nthe award by the Arbitral Tribunal. The FIR indicates that the\n\nComplainant or Informant as mere &#x27;Source Information&#x27;. The\n\nnames of three employees of NTPC is named as accused\n\nNo.1/M.V.Padma Kumar, Senior Manager (Civil); accused\n\nNo.2-S.S.Nathan,      AGM    (Safety)    and   accused     No.3-\n\nV.K.Pradhan,     General     Manager      (Project).     Accused\n\nNo.1/Company had been named as accused No.4. After\n\ncompletion of investigation, the charge sheet is filed only\n\nagainst the accused No.1/Company and two other individuals,\n\none among whom is an employee with a private survey\n\nenterprise and another who was the then Project Manager,\n\nthe petitioner herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">      12.    It is alleged that there is a criminal conspiracy\n\nentered     between   them   and   in   pursuance   of   criminal\n\nconspiracy, they fabricated second set of Original Ground\n\nLevel Data and falsified the measurements in the same and\n\nfurther got the signatures of unsuspecting NTPC officials\n\nfraudulently on the said fabricated second set of ground level\n\ndata with an intention to cheat the NTPC.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                   9</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">      13.     It is further alleged that on the basis of said\n\nfabricated second set of Original Ground Level Data made a\n\nfraudulent claim in the 15 th RA bill by grossly inflating the\n\nwork done and attempted to cheat NTPC to the tune of\n\nRs.47,15,34,723/- thereby they have committed the offence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">      14.     In this regard, the charge sheet came to be filed\n\nagainst them before Senior Civil Judge &amp; JMFC, Basavana\n\nBagewadi, Vijayapura District. The learned JMFC has taken\n\ncognizance and ordered issue of summons for the offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 120-B</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_7\">468</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/182233/\" id=\"a_8\">472</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1185693/\" id=\"a_9\">511</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">      15.     It is further contended that the proceedings\n\nagainst accused Nos.1 and 2 were quashed by this Court in\n\nW.P.Nos.200439/2021 and 200441/2021 dated 23.12.2021.\n\nTherefore, the continuation of proceedings against this\n\npetitioner/accused No.3 is challenged in this petition.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">      16.     Heard Sri.B.V.Acharya, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for Sri.Amar Correa and Sri.Amresh S. learned\n\ncounsel for petitioner and Sri.Madhav Kashyap, learned\n\ncounsel     appearing   for   Sri.Prasannakumar   Special   Public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 10</span>\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor for respondent No.1/CBI, ACB branch, Ganga\n\nNagar, Bangalore and Sri.D.P.Ambekar, learned counsel\n\nappearing for NTPC Limited, New Delhi, who is respondent\n\nNo.2 herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">      17.   Learned    Senior        counsel   argued   that   the\n\nallegations made in the charge sheet and materials relied\n\ntherein, if they are taken at their face value and accepted in\n\ntheir entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence to\n\nmake out a case against this petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">      18.   The learned senior counsel further argued that\n\ninitiation of fresh criminal proceedings and opening it for\n\nreadmission is not permissible as the same issue was upheld\n\nby Delhi High Court, on the findings of Arbitral Tribunal. The\n\nFIR was lodged on the basis of &#x27;Source Information&#x27; which is\n\nnot disclosed or revealed. The Investigating Agency cannot\n\nsit in judgment of Arbitral Tribunal and findings of the High\n\nCourt of Delhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">      19.   Learned Senior Counsel further argued that one\n\nset of Original Ground Level Data has been signed by four\n\nofficials of NTPC including its Authorized Signatory and it has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                11</span>\n\n\n\n\nbeen signed by the Authorized Signatory of the Company,\n\nwho is this petitioner and also by another on behalf of the\n\nSurveyors   as   attesting   witness.   On   the   contrary   the\n\ndocument which is relied as another document has been\n\nsigned by the Authorised Signatory of NTPC and another\n\nperson by name Augustine, who is not even the Authorized\n\nperson to represent the Company. The said Augustine was\n\nonly a helper to surveying team and he was kind of an only\n\ndaily wage worker. The said document consists of highly\n\ntechnical and engineering data, it cannot be signed by\n\nAugustine, because according to petitioner information even\n\nhe has not completed his matriculation. The Investigating\n\nAgency in their final report, left out the NTPC employees, but\n\nonly filed a charge sheet against the Company. The learned\n\nSenior Counsel further argued that the criminal proceedings\n\nare nothing but the proceedings before the Court arising out\n\nof contractual dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">      20.   Learned Senior Counsel further argued that after\n\nfiling of the charge sheet, an appeal was filed in High Court of\n\nDelhi in FA(OS) No.91/2020. Learned Senior Counsel further\n\nargued that the filing of criminal proceedings is only an after\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                     12</span>\n\n\n\n\nthought        and   as   a   counter blast   to   the   award   dated\n\n07.07.2017 in favour of the Company and against NTPC, just\n\nto put a pressure and with a malafide and ulterior motive a\n\ncriminal case was registered and the charge sheet has been\n\nfiled.     The charge sheet does not disclose any specific\n\nindividual who according to CBI has allegedly committed any\n\nact of forgery. The FSL report as to whether the document of\n\nmeasurements in question is forged or not is still not\n\nforthcoming that itself indicate that the CBI is not definite\n\nthat as on this day there is no proof of any forgery. It is\n\nfurther argued that the electronic record has been seized\n\nfrom the official of NTPC not by these accused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">         21.    The learned Senior Counsel further argued that\n\nthe allegation made in the charge sheet are absurd. There is\n\ndelay of four and half years in filing the complaint, when the\n\nOriginal Ground Level records, which were alleged to be\n\nforged and fabricated and they were available with NTPC\n\nsince February 2013. None of the ingredients necessary to\n\nattract commission of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 120-B</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_12\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/182233/\" id=\"a_13\">472</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1185693/\" id=\"a_14\">511</a> of IPC are made out.\n\nThe learned Senior Counsel argued that the matter which is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                13</span>\n\n\n\n\npending is civil in nature, initiation of criminal proceedings is\n\nnothing but abuse of process of law and abuse of process of\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">      22.    The learned Senior Counsel further argued that\n\nas regards allegations of conspiracy, the case against accused\n\nNos.1 and 2 is already quashed and proceedings are\n\nterminated, therefore, the said charge is not tenable against\n\nthis petitioner only. It is also not forthcoming as to whether\n\nthe specimen signature of accused is obtained to send same\n\nto FSL to justify the claim of or to show that RA Bill 15 are\n\nfabricated, which are in custody of NTPC only. Therefore,\n\nthere is no material to show or to substantiate the allegations\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 468</a> of IPC. The NTPC employees themselves\n\nadmitted    signatures   on the notings maintained       in   the\n\nmeasurements books, which is appreciated by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, therefore, the question of fabrication does not arise.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160302767\" id=\"span_11\">23.    The learned Senior Counsel in support of his\n\narguments, has relied on the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/160302767/\" id=\"a_16\">Parbhat Bhai Ahir vs State of Gujarat\n\nand Ors.</a> reported in (2017) 9 SCC 641 wherein the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                14</span>\n\n\n\n\nSupreme Court held that in a Commercial/Contractual/Civil\n\ndispute between the parties no criminal proceeding is\n\nmaintainable. It is not forthcoming what is the basis for FIR,\n\nwhich is &#x27;Source information&#x27;. None of the authorized persons\n\nfrom NTPC which is a Corporation have lodged any complaint.\n\nThis shows just to put a pressure on respondent, this\n\npetitioner and his Company, initiated criminal proceedings.\n\nThe learned Senior Counsel draw the attention of the Court to\n\nthe order passed by the co-ordinate Bench of this Court in\n\nthe above referred writ petition, quashing the proceedings as\n\nto how the CBI has exercised its power in a colourable\n\nmanner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">     24.   Learned Senior Counsel relied on decision of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of Sardool Singh and\n\nAnother vs. Smt.Nasib Kaur reported in 1987 (Supp)\n\nSCC 146 and in the case of Madhavrao Jiwaji Rao Scindia\n\nand another etc vs. Sambhajirao Chandrojirao Angre\n\nand others etc., reported in AIR 1988 SC 709.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">     25.   Learned    Senior    Counsel   argued   that   this\n\npetitioner who stands on an identical allegation as that of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                    15</span>\n\n\n\n\nother accused regarding whom the Co-ordinate Bench of this\n\nCourt has quashed the proceedings, this petitioner is also\n\nentitled for the same relief in view of the material available\n\nfrom the charge sheet. Therefore, learned Senior Counsel\n\nargued that the initiation of criminal proceedings, is an after\n\nthought. As counter blast to the Arbitral Award dated\n\n07.07.2017 against NTPC which has been held liable to pay\n\nan amount of INR 47,54,30,798/- with future interest at the\n\nrate of 8.9%, for breach of contract committed by NTPC. The\n\nsaid NTPC colluding with CBI has got filed this case making\n\nfalse allegation just to pressurize the petitioner-Company to\n\ncome    for   settlement.       Therefore,   as   the   initiation   of\n\nproceedings is a violation of fundamental constitutional right\n\nto life and liberty, the said proceedings are liable to be\n\nquashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">       26.    Against   this,     Sri.Madhav      Kashyap,    learned\n\ncounsel appearing on behalf of Sri.Prasannakumar, Spl.PP for\n\nrespondent No.1/CBI argued that as per the order dated\n\n30.05.2017, the Chief Vigilance Commission and on the basis\n\nof &#x27;source information&#x27; respondent No.1/CBI registered an FIR\n\nagainst four accused persons and after detail investigation,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  16</span>\n\n\n\n\nfiled the charge sheet. The allegation is that the accused got\n\ncreated a second set of site level records which facilitate\n\naccused No.1 to submit inflated false bills to the tune of\n\nRs.47.15 crores. The said documents are fabricated.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">     27.   He further argued that accused No.1 submitted\n\n14 RA bills for the period June 2012 till the termination of\n\ncontract in September 2013. Each of the said RA bill is\n\naccompanied by a covering letter signed by petitioner/\n\naccused No.3 and quantities mentioned therein are duly\n\ncertified. The bill submitted is approved by General Manger of\n\nKudgi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">     28.   The learned counsel argued that on bare perusal\n\nof RA Bill 15, it is evident that the block wise quantities,\n\nwhich are mentioned in the bill, does not tally with the site\n\ndiary bearing daily progress for the item No.1 or item No.3 as\n\nmentioned in RA.15. So, this shows that RA.15 is a bogus bill\n\nsubmitted just to defraud respondent No.2. The letters were\n\nexchanged in this regard and the accused No.1 is not entitled\n\nfor payment said bill. Accused No.3 who is the petitioner\n\nherein   and   representatives        of   Accused   No.1./Company\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 17</span>\n\n\n\n\nfraudulently got signatures of the officials of respondent No.2\n\nand same was brought to the notice of accused No.1 and\n\naccused No.1 did not come forward to carry the joint\n\nmeasurement of the existing ground level data.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">      29.   He further argued that the investigation reveled\n\nthat the petitioner and two other accused persons entered\n\ninto criminal conspiracy and in pursuance to the same have\n\nfabricated original ground level data and getting signatures\n\nfrom officials of respondent No.2 fraudulently with an\n\nintention to cheat respondent No.2 and submit grossly\n\ninflated 15 RA bill. Hence, there has been an attempt to\n\ncheat to the tune of Rs.47,15,34,723/-. Therefore, the\n\nfindings do not come in the way of filing criminal cases. The\n\nlearned counsel also argued that the criminal proceedings\n\ncannot be quashed merely because there is civil proceeding\n\nregarding the very same transaction. It is seen whether there\n\nis any criminal colour to the civil transactions.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">      30.   Learned counsel further argued that the source of\n\nan investigating agency is protected communication and need\n\nnot be revealed, as held by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court time and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 18</span>\n\n\n\n\nagain. Therefore, no prejudice is caused to this petitioner by\n\nnot revealing the source information to this petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">      31.    Learned counsel further argued that the accused\n\nNo.1 has not intimated respondent No.2 as to whether said\n\nAugustine was authorized representative or not, as his name\n\nis found in list of employees of Accused No.1. No argument\n\ncan be made on that ground.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">      32.    Regarding the submission that as the Arbitration\n\nAward is passed as a counter blast, it is argued that\n\nrespondent No.2 has not filed any official complaint, it is the\n\nrespondent     No.1,   based   on    order   of   CBI   and   source\n\ninformation, have took up investigation. Therefore, such\n\nground is not tenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">      33.    The learned counsel further argued that the\n\ncompany is an independent legal juristic person. Company is\n\nindependent of its Directors can be made as an accused. As\n\nthe   source    information    was    received     on   27.08.2017\n\nimmediately FIR was registered. So, there is no delay on the\n\npart of registering the FIR.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                     19</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">        34.   The learned counsel argued that respondent No.1\n\nhas     challenged    the   order   of   this    Court   quashing    the\n\nproceedings against accused Nos.1 and 2 before the Apex\n\nCourt in SLP(Crl) No.007903-007904/2022; and respondent\n\nNo.2 has      filed   two   separate     SLPs,    namely,   SLP     (Crl)\n\nNo.6402/2022 and SLP (Crl) No.006732/2022 against the\n\norder     passed      by     the    learned       Single    Judge      in\n\nW.P.No.200439/2021 and W.P.No.200441/2021. Therefore,\n\nthe order of quashing has not attained finality. With these\n\ncontentions the learned counsel prays to dismiss the petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">        35.   Sri.D.P.Ambekar, learned counsel for respondent\n\nNo.2 argued in the same line that of respondent No.1 and\n\ncontended that quashing of proceeding in respect of two\n\naccused is pending before the Supreme Court and it has not\n\nattained finality. There might be negligence on the part of\n\nrespondent No.2-Company officials in counter signing those\n\ndocuments. But that is not a ground to quash proceedings\n\nagainst this petitioner. Learned counsel argued that in view of\n\nthe material placed by respondent No.1/CBI, the proceedings\n\ncannot be quashed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                 20</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">     36.   I have perused the FIR, the charge sheet, other\n\nmaterials, the objection statement filed by respondent No.1,\n\ndecisions relied by the petitioner&#x27;s counsel and also the\n\njudgment passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court\n\nagainst accused Nos.1 and 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_63\">     37.   The    undisputed         contentions    are   that,   on\n\n02.04.2012 there was a contact agreement between M/s\n\nAvantika   Contractors    and         National     Thermal    Power\n\nCorporation. Total estimated cost is Rs.189 crore; It is\n\nevident that on 24.03.2014 there was a termination of the\n\ncontract by NTPC. Thereafter, on 23.01.2016 the matter was\n\nreferred to three Members Panel Arbitration, with claims on\n\nboth sides, Arbitral Tribunal entered on reference. The\n\ndispute was with respect to original ground level data, each\n\nparty relying on conflicting data sheets. It is not in dispute\n\nthat on 07.07.2017 Arbitral Tribunal after due enquiry passed\n\nthe unanimous award awarding Rs.50,21,54,497/- in favour\n\nof the petitioner-company and Rs.2,67,23,699/- in favour of\n\nNTPC, thus holding the petitioner company being entitled to\n\nRs.47,54,30,798/-. It is also not disputed that on 27.10.2017\n\nabout 100 days after the award, and more than 3 ½ years\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     21</span>\n\n\n\n\nafter the dispute started, CBI suo-muto on the basis of\n\n&#x27;source information&#x27; registered FIR against some officials of\n\nNTPC and the petitioner company under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections 120-B</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_19\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_20\">471</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/896188/\" id=\"a_21\">477-A</a> of Indian Penal Code and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/86648814/\" id=\"a_22\">section 13(2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThere was no reference to Arbitral award, whatsoever. It is\n\nalso not disputed that on 13.10.2017 the NTPC challenged\n\nthe award before the Delhi High Court under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 34</a> of\n\nArbitration and Reconciliation Act. On 08.06.2020, the Delhi\n\nHigh Court confirmed the award passed by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal and dismissed the petition of NTPC. Now the appeal\n\nis pending before the Division Bench of the High Court which\n\nwas filed on 31.07.2020. The CBI filed the charge sheet on\n\n22.12.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">     38.     It    is     evident   from    the    records    that   the\n\nmeasurement data sheets relied by the Company was also\n\nsubject matter of discussion before Arbitral Tribunal. The\n\nsame was accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal.                  The main\n\ndispute    urged        before   Tribunal   is    also   regarding   the\n\nmeasurement regarding original level data as alleged. It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    22</span>\n\n\n\n\nalso evident that the data sheet is signed by the authorized\n\nperson of NTPC and also other authorized representative of\n\nthe Company.         As contended by the petitioner, the said\n\nAugustine was not authorized representative of the Company.\n\nTherefore,   relying    on   the   signature   of   Augustine,   the\n\nInvestigating Officer have filed the charge sheet against\n\nthese accused persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">      39.    It is evident from records that the dispute is\n\nregarding the RA 15 Bill i.e. measurements recorded in\n\noriginal ground level data.        The same was subject matter\n\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal, which was referred by consent of\n\nboth the parties, the said Arbitral Tribunal after due enquiry\n\npassed unanimously award holding that this petitioner-\n\nCompany is entitled to Rs.47,54,30,798/-. At the cost of\n\nrepetition I would state that the same was challenged before\n\nthe Delhi high Court as per Annexure-D dated 07.07.2017; as\n\nper annexure-E passed an order uphelding the finding of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">      40.    On perusing the certified copy of charge sheet\n\nwhich is at Annexure-C, it is evident that the three officials of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                               23</span>\n\n\n\n\nNTPC by name M.A.Padmakumar, S.Shanmuganathan @\n\nS.S.Nathan,   and    V.K.Pradhan,    who     were    authorized\n\nsignatories of respondent No.2 have been left out stating that\n\nno incriminating evidence found with regard to the above said\n\naccused persons for prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">      41.   I have perused the award at Annexure-D dated\n\n07.07.2017.   The   arbitrators    have    raised   issues   and\n\nconsidered interim application. The issue No.4 is the issue of\n\nmeasurement. The Tribunal at Para No.164 of the award has\n\nconsidered the dispute and held that there is no dispute\n\nregarding final levels and also referred clause 37.6 of the\n\ncontract. When the measurement signed by both the parties\n\non the day of measurement and considered the reference of\n\ndispute to DRB and also referred to 7.3 of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_26\">Arbitration Act</a>\n\nand answered that issue, that the claim No.6 which falls\n\nwithin the jurisdiction and it has also considered the other\n\nissues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">      42.

Now the appeal is\n\npending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\">      43.   It is evident that after termination of contract in\n\nthe year 2014, now complaint was lodged and criminal case\n\nwas registered. On the other hand, on the same dispute and\n\nother disputes, the matter was referred to three members of\n\nArbitration. They suffered an award and was challenged and\n\nthe matter was upheld 08.06.2020 by High Court and now\n\nthe appeal is pending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\">      44.   The claim was made relating to R.A.Bill.No.15\n\nand also with regard to measurement which was terminated.\n\nAs per the clause in the agreement the parties went for\n\narbitration. The respondent No.2 did not filed any complaint.\n\nOn the other hand, the respondent No.1 was set up by\n\nrespondent No.2. As already stated above, though the FIR\n\nwas registered against the officials of NTPC, but in the charge\n\nsheet they were exonerated stating that there is no evidence\n\nagainst them. Though there is allegation earlier that these\n\npersons by colluding with accused Nos.1 to 3 have created\n\nthe documents and though the authorized signatory of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                    25</span>\n\n\n\n\nrespondent No.2 have counter signed on those documents\n\nbut only these petitioners are included. Earlier though\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_27\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> was invoked, but same not\n\npressed into service. Only contention that there is some\n\nallegation against the officials that they have signed on the\n\ndocuments. But against the petitioner and other two the\n\ncharge sheet was filed alleging that they have fabricated the\n\ndocuments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">      45.     As discussed above, the charge sheet was filed\n\nonly when the matter was pending before the Division Bench\n\nof High Court against the order of Single Bench of Delhi High\n\nCourt. It is argued that the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_28\">Evidence Act</a> is not applicable\n\nbefore      Arbitration   proceeding.    The    consideration      in\n\ndepartmental proceedings are different from considering the\n\nevidence in a criminal case. The same is not disputed. It is\n\nalso not disputed that the acquittal or conviction criminal\n\ncase has no bearing on the departmental proceedings, unless\n\nthe witnesses and the documents and the evidence relied are\n\nidentical in both the cases. The contention that question of\n\ncriminal    provisions    cannot   be   gone   into   a   arbitration\n\nproceeding, has no basis at all in view of the long delay in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                               26</span>\n\n\n\n\nfiling the complaint. Admittedly, the respondent No.1 is a\n\ncentral government employee. When the NTPC officials have\n\ncounter signed the second set of documents, which is a claim\n\nbill in respect of RA.Bill.No.15, there cannot be two standards\n\nadopted by the CBI by exonerating them and filing case\n\nagainst petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">      46.   I have perused the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Sardool Singh and Another\n\nvs. Nasib Kaur reported in 1987 (Supp) SCC 146, the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that when the matter regarding\n\nWILL is seized by the Civil Court, the other side cannot be\n\npermitted to institute a criminal proceedings on the allegation\n\nthat will a forged one.

In that case also the criminal proceedings were\n\ninstituted for the offence punishable under Sections 406, 467,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                               <a href=\"/doc/767390/\" id=\"a_29\">27</a></span>\n\n\n\n\n120-B r/w 34 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_30\">IPC</a>.

The legal position is well settled that\n     when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked\n     to be quashed, the test to be applied by the\n     Court is as to whether the uncontraverted\n     allegations as made prima-facie establish the\n     offence. It is also for the Court to take into\n     consideration   any   special   features   which\n     appear in a particular case to consider whether\n     it is expedient and in the interest of justice to\n     permit a prosecution to continue. This is so on\n     the basis that the Court cannot be utilized for\n     any oblique purpose and where in the opinion\n     of the Court chances of an ultimate conviction\n     are bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is\n     likely to be served by allowing a criminal\n     prosecution to continue, the Court may while\n     taking into consideration the special facts of a\n     case also quash the proceeding even though it\n     may be at a preliminary stage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118326933\" id=\"span_26\">47.

Such an exercise is\n       nothing but an abuse of the process of law\n       which must be discouraged in its entirety.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">       48.     In the light of these principles, if the present\n\npetition is considered, and also as the petition against the\n\naccused Nos.1 and 2 is quashed by the Co-ordinate Bench of\n\nthis   Court    in   the   above    referred   writ   petitions,   the\n\ncontinuation of proceedings against this petitioner is nothing\n\nbut abuse of process of Court. Nothing is pointed as to how\n\nthe case of this petitioner is different or differs from the\n\nallegation in the charge sheet, from the petitioner and\n\naccused No.1 and 2. On the other hand, similar allegations\n\nare made against this petitioner and same documentary\n\nevidence is relied against this petitioner also. It is also\n\nevident that the contract of agreement and documents which\n\nare subject matter of criminal case are also the same as that\n\nin the arbitration proceedings.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                     30</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">       49.    The contention urged in that petition and the\n\narguments advanced in those writ petitions are one and the\n\nsame. Therefore, in view of quashing proceedings against\n\naccused      Nos.1    and    2   in       W.P.Nos.200439/2021       and\n\n200441/2021 vide order dated 23.12.2021, in view of the\n\ndiscussion made above and also the principles stated by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the decisions referred above, in my\n\nconsidered view, the initiation of criminal proceedings against\n\nthis   petitioner    also   needs        to    be   quashed.   Otherwise\n\ncontinuation of proceedings is nothing but abuse of process of\n\nlaw and also it is nothing but the miscarriage of justice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_87\">       50.

No.006732/2022 and case status report against the\n\norder passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this Court quashing\n\nthe proceedings. It is not disputed that the matter is not\n\nadmitted yet and there is no interim stay order passed. The\n\nmatter is pending for fresh admission. Therefore, there is no\n\nstay to the order passed by learned Co-ordinate Bench of this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                      31</span>\n\n\n\n\nCourt in respect of order passed in writ petition filed by\n\naccused No.1 and 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">           51.    Therefore, in view of the above, in my considered\n\nview and in the ends of justice, this petition deserves to be\n\nallowed.
