The 1st respondent is the Andhra Pradesh Education &amp; \nWelfare Infrastructure Development Corporation (for short,\nAPEWIDC). On behalf of the 1st respondent supra, its Superintendent\nEngineer (4th respondent) invited tenders for construction of A.P.Social\nWelfare Residential School at B.Mattam of Kadapa District vide NIT\nNo.295/SE/ APEWIDC/ KDP/AE/2016-17,dt.05.11.2016.  The petitioner-   \nfirm and two others submitted tenders and the 4th respondent opened\nthe technical bid on 12.12.2016 and found all the three bidders are\nqualified and on the same day, having opened the price bid, submitted\nsame to the 3rd respondent-the Chief Engineer and Chairman, \nAPEWIDC(R.1) who has to refer the same to Tender Committee (2nd   \nrespondent) represented by its Principal Secretary, Social Welfare\nDepartment, Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, for the cost of the work is more\nthan 2Crores and however the Tender Committee rejected the tender \nof the petitioner-firm and disqualified it by forfeited the EMD of 1% and\nalso suspending from participating in tenders up to 31.03.2017 on the\nground that the petitioner-firm failed to furnish two ongoing works in\nthe Statement-IV of tender schedule. It is the grievance of the\npetitioner-firm therefrom in seeking the relief more particularly in the\nnature of relief of writ of mandamus declaring the rejection of the bid\nof the petitioner-firm and disqualifying and suspending from\nparticipation in the tenders of APEWIDC upto 31.03.2017 and forfeiting\nthe EMD as per communication by the 1st respondent by  \nmemo,dt.23.01.2017 and letter of intimation of the same to the 4th\nrespondent pursuant thereto, dt. 24.01.2017 as illegal, arbitrary and\nunsustainable with a consequential direction to accept the bid of the\npetitioner-firm and to award the work in its favour and to pass such\nother order/s.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">      2. The averments further in support of the writ petition prayer\nare that the petitioner-firm fulfilled the qualification prescribed under\nclause-14 of the tender notice with bid capacity as per Formula(2AN-B)\nand furnished particulars in the formats enclosed supported by\ndocuments and in the Statement-IV of the formats of the existing\ncommitments i.e. works on hand and works for which bids are \nsubmitted to be mentioned is to be evaluated bid capacity of the\nbidder, that the petitioner-firm has the bid capacity of 35.06crores as\nper the information furnished in Statement-IV which is more than the\ntender value of Rs.15,69,38,030/- and the Tender Committee, having\nopened the price bid of the petitioner-firm and others and found the\npetitioner-firm is the lowest quoted bid of 5.39% less than the other\nbidders. The petitioner-firm in the Statement-IV furnished details of 15\nongoing works and three works of which tenders submitted and \nhowever by oversight, it has not mentioned two ongoing works of\nRs.4,04,63,454/- (Rs.3,22,61,439/-+Rs.82,02, 015/-) and pursuant to\nthe notice issued by the 3rd respondent dt.04.01.2017 the petitioner-\nfirm furnished the details of the two works not mentioned in the\nStatement-IV and from its adding available bid capacity of\nRs.31,01,74,164/- is more than the tender value and fulfilled the\ncriteria and the 3rd respondent pursuant to which even recommended\nto the Tender Committee, which concluded that the non-mentioning of\nthe two ongoing works in the Statement-IV amounts to furnishing of\nfalse/fraudulent certificates with tender which is a disqualification and\ndisqualified, though the petitioner-firm is found to be L-1 in price bid.\nIt is also the contention that even as per the conditions of tender notice\nafter opening of the technical bid and price bid, the tender opening\nauthority opened the price bid and sent to 3rd respondent for\nevaluation and submission to the Tender Committee, which called for\ncertain details from the 3rd respondent, on which the 3rd respondent\nissued notice to the petitioner-firm and obtained value of other two\nongoing works which were not mentioned in the statement-IV. On \nfurnishing the value of other two ongoing works, the available bid\ncapacity of the petitioner-firm is more than tender value, the 3rd\nrespondent has recommended to the Tender Committee to consider the   \nbid of the petitioner-firm. Even as per the conditions of tender notice,\nafter opening the technical bid and price bid, the tender opening\nauthority or the evaluating authority can call the bidder for\nclarification of the statements and once the petitioner-firm clarified on\nthe Statement-IV by furnishing other two ongoing works originally not\nmentioned, it shows that the petitioner-firm has no intention to\nmislead the Tender Committee. There is even nothing of false\nstatement or fabricated document furnished that too even if those two\nworks included by the petitioner-firm with bid capacity that was also\ntaken into consideration by the 3rd respondent, the decision of the\nTender Committee in disqualifying the petitioner-firm under sole\nground for the furnishing of incomplete information which has actually\nno effect on the bid capacity of the petitioner-firm is thereby arbitrary.\nIt is also the contention that it is not only the disqualification of the\npetitioner-firm but also suspended from tendering works in the\nAPEWIDC and that too, without issuing notice and opportunity,\nsuspended for tendering works besides forfeiting 1% EMD by violation of\nthe principles of natural justice, hence the order of disqualification,\nsuspending from participation and forfeiting of 1%EMD is contrary to\nlaw, illegal and arbitrary and thereby to set aside the same and order\nof interim suspension of the proceedings and consequently direct the\n2nd respondent to accept the bid and award the work and pass such \nother orders.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">      3. The learned Standing Counsel for the respondents represented\nby the Managing Director of 1st respondent Corporation filed counter\naffidavit on behalf of the respondents by denying the writ petition\naverments and with the contentions impugning the maintainability of\nthe writ petition and justifying the action and disentitlement to any\nreliefs, that the Social Welfare Department of Govt. of Andhra Pradesh\naccorded administrative sanction for the construction of 5 A.P.Social\nWelfare Residential Schools on permanent basis under Rural \nInfrastructure Development vide G.O.Ms. No.22, Social Welfare\n(RS2),Department,dt.20.02.2016 and the residential School at B\nMattam, Kadapa district is one among the 5. The Secretary of the\nSociety requested the 1st respondent to instruct the Chief Engineer of\nrespondent Corporation to call for tenders for construction of\nresidential schools that shall be completed within 12 months vide letter\ndated 24.10.2016 of 4th respondent. Consequently the 4th respondent\ninvited tenders with an ECV of Rs.15,69,38,030/- dt.05.11.2016 through\ne-procurement, whereunder 5 tenders were received and the\npetitioner-firm is one of such bidders. As per the technical bid\nevaluation, 3 bidders were qualified including the petitioner-firm from\ntechnical bids opened on 30.11.2016 and the price bids opened on\n09.12.2016. The 4th respondent evaluated the tenders received to the\nsubject work and recommended the petitioner-firm as qualified and\nthe matter placed before the Tender Committee(2nd respondent) which \nmet on 04.01.2017 and while the matter is under process, certain firms\nhave participated in the tenders to the subject work, represented to\nthe 3rd respondent stating that NIC conditions were not followed while\ndeclaring the successful tenderer who have not qualified saying without\nverification of NIT conditions the officers opened the tenders and\ndeclared the petitioner-firm as if  successful tenderer and thereby the\ntenders for work has to be cancelled and re-tenders to be called for by\nfollowing the procedure.  It is pursuant to the said representation\nreceived by the 3rd respondent, the 3rd respondent referred to the 4th\nrespondent for a detailed report by memo dated 17.12.2016 and the\nmatter placed before the 2nd respondent for consideration with the\ninformation received on 04.01.2017, there the 2nd respondent-Tender\nCommittee directed the R.1-Corporation to verify the complaint with\nconcerned executive agency/bidder and to place before the Committee \non 11.01.2017,  thereafter the 3rd respondent issued letters to all\nbidders L.1 to L.3 which include the petitioner-firm on 04.01.2017\nrequesting to attend office of the Corporation with concerned\ndocuments in person on 06.01.2017 and they attended the 3rd \nrespondent but not submitted/disclosed about the particulars with\nregard to works on hand. It is therefrom on verification of the\ncomplaint with concerned Department, the 4th respondent submitted in\nhis report that the petitioner-firm has not shown the works on hand in\nStatement-IV of the tender conditions and the allegation made by L.2-\nfirm in this regard is genuine and correct vide letter, dt. 06.12.2017\nand the matter when placed before the Tender Committee-R.2 on \n11.01.2017, the Committee, after examining the work-wise details\nobserved that all the three bidders furnished incomplete information\nby suppressing works on hand in Statement-IV of the tender document \nin their bids and the bidder should submit the works invariably as\nspecified in the tender schedule with necessary conditions failing which\ntender can be treated as incomplete and liable to be summarily\nrejected. Thus Tender Committee in its meeting held on 11.01.2017,\nafter due examination, decided all the 3 bidders L.1(Petitioner-firm) to\nL.3 treated disqualified and forfeited the EMD and suspended them\nfrom tendering the works in the APEWIDC upto 31.03.2017 and directed \nthe R.1Corporation to recall the tenders for the work through short\ntenders. Keeping in view of the Tender Committee minutes, the 1st\nrespondent-Corporation issued orders directing the 4th respondent to\ntake further action in terms of the decision of the Tender Committee,\ndt.23.01.2017 and in turn R.4 intimated to the petitioner-firm and the\nother two bidders and requested the bank authorities concerned to\nrelease the bank guarantee submitted by them to the Corporation\naccount by letter, dt. 24.01.2017.  It is the further contention in the\ncounter affidavit that to qualify for consideration of award of the\ncontract, the tenderer should fulfill the qualification information listed\nat page- 237 of the bid document, signed by the petitioner-firm,\nwherein point No.17 referred to statement of existing commitments in\nongoing Government works along with supporting experience \ncertificates as in Statement-IV, the petitioner-firm furnished\nincomplete information by suppressing certain work details on hand\nwhich is very clear that it willfully breached the tender conditions and\nis liable for disqualification in terms of self-declaration given by the\npetitioner-firm automatically. The petitioner-firm and the other two\nbidders have not declared the complete list of works on hand and\nthereby once failed to abide by the tender conditions even they quoted\nbid price the lowest, not entitled to be considered. It is thereby\ndisqualified the petitioner-firm, forfeiting the EMD and suspending to\nparticipate in tendering the works up to 31.03.2017 not only the\npetitioner-firm and other two bidders also and the contrary averments\nare untrue and unsustainable as it is from the complaint received\nagainst the petitioner-firm and on verification and finding the\nsuppression of the material, the action is taken by rejection of the\ntenders among other bonafides since the petitioner-firm concealed the\nfacts and submitted incomplete information and thereby not fulfilled\nthe tender conditions and suffered disqualification therefrom and the\naction is since genuine and proper and no way arbitrary and illegal and\nno way questionable. It is also the further averment that the tender\nconditions can be classified into two categories one is essential\nconditions on eligibility and the other is mere ancillary and subsidiary\nand in case of non-compliance of essential conditions of eligibility,  it is\nan automatic disqualification of the tenderer that too the tender\nessential conditions clause-11 says all details should be noted in the\ncolumns 1 to 8 of the statements which are mandatory and once the \nessential conditions are not fulfilled by suppression of information, the\ntender is liable to be rejected from the disqualification apart from\naction, hence the writ petition is liable to be dismissed. It is also the\nsubmission in the counter affidavit that there is no violation of\nprinciples of natural justice in view of the above factual matrix and the\ncontrary averments are untrue and the tender was issued fixing time\nbound schedule to complete the residential school construction within\n12 months as any delay in completion of the project will cause harm to\nthe students community for lack of accommodation and further it is\nonly to complete the process, the respondents are forced to call for\nshort tender notice to complete the work in the larger interest of the\nstudent community and because of the interim orders on 31.01.2017 \nrestraining the respondents in finalization of the short tender notice,\ndt.30.07.2017, the further progress could not be made and the interim\norder is liable to be vacated, otherwise it will cause loss to the state\nexchequer also besides effecting career of the students and seeking to\nvacate the interim order and dismiss the writ petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">      4. Pursuant to the above, heard the learned counsel for the\npetitioner-firm and also the learned Standing Counsel for the\nrespondents and perused the material on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">     5. Coming to answer several contentions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     (i). So far as e-tenders or short tenders concerned, auction by\ncalling tenders is only one of the modes and not even the only mode nor\nit is a constitutional mandate. In this regard, the Constitution Bench of\nthe Apex Court (5JB) in Natural Resources Allocation, in Re, Special\nReference No. 1 of 2012  observed at para-199 that:.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">The policy of allocation of natural resources for public good can\nbe defined by the legislature, as has been discussed in the\nforegoing paragraphs. Likewise, policy for allocation of natural\nresources may also be determined by the executive. The \nparameters for determining the legality and constitutionality of the\ntwo are exactly the same. In the aforesaid view of the matter,\nthere can be no doubt about the conclusion recorded in the main\nopinion that auction which is just one of the several price\nrecovery mechanisms, cannot be held to be the only\nconstitutionally recognized method for alienation of natural\nresources. That should not be understood to mean, that it can\nnever be a valid method for disposal of natural resources (refer to\nparagraphs 186 to 188 of my instant opinion).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">In para 186, the earlier expression in Common cause supra was\nreferred and relied. At para 188 observed that auction is not a\nconstitutional mandate, in the nature of an absolute principle\nwhich has to be applied in all situations. The policy for allocation\nof natural resources may also be determined by the executive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">      (ii). So far as maintainability of the writ petition against the\nrespondents concerned, the 1st respondent corporation is once an\nauthority and otherwise any other authority within the meaning of\nState under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, the writ petition is\nmaintainable if otherwise to entertain. Once the 1st respondent is\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, it is bound to\nfollow the doctrine of fairness and good faith in their activities\nincluding in the process of tenders and finalization, needless to say\nequally there cannot be any monopoly status even to tenderers. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"404603\" id=\"span_1\">In this\nregard, the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court (5JB) in <a href=\"/doc/404603/\" id=\"a_3\">Zee\nTelefilms Ltd. Vs.  Union of India</a>  (in WP No.(civil) 541 of 2004-SLP\nNo.(civil) 20186 of 2004, dt.02/02/2005), held that-\nA monopoly status need not always be created by a law within the\nmeaning of clauses 2 to 6 of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1662742\" id=\"span_2\">The Board in view of enormity of powers is bound to follow &quot;the\ndoctrine of fairness and good faith in all its activities&quot;-[See Board of\nControl for <a href=\"/doc/1662742/\" id=\"a_5\">Cricket, India &amp; Anr. Vs. Netaji Cricket Club</a> ].</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">       It is because the object of Part III of our Constitution is to\ncurtail abuse of power and if by reason of the Boards activities,\nfairness in action is expected. The decisions rendered in different\njurisdictions clearly suggest that a body like the Board would\ncome within the purview of the expression &quot;Other Authorities&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1186368\" id=\"span_3\">contained in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.  For that\nconclusion, the Apex Court referred its earlier expression of the\nConstitution Bench(6JB) in <a href=\"/doc/1186368/\" id=\"a_7\">Ajay Hasia Etc vs. Khalid Mujib\nSehravardi</a> , that vividly answered the description of &quot;Authority\nand Other Authorities&quot; contained in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution\nof India that if the Society is an instrumentality or the agency of\nthe State and the Central  Governments, it is an &quot;authority&quot; and,\ntherefore, the &quot;State&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 12</a> and it must\nfollow that it is subject to the constitutional obligation under\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 14.</a> The expression &quot;other authorities&quot;, in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 12</a> must\nbe given an interpretation where constitutional fundamentals vital\nto the maintenance of human rights are at stake, functional\nrealism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic tool, for\nconstitutional law must seek the substance and not the form.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"171757007\" id=\"span_4\">(iii). So far as the right of tenderers against rejection of tender\nto impugn concerned,  the Apex Court in one of the very recent\nexpressions, in <a href=\"/doc/171757007/\" id=\"a_12\">Haryana Urban Development Authority and others Vs. \nOrchid Infrastructure Developers Pvt. Ltd.</a> , by referring to the\nearlier expressions held from paras-27 to 32 that:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837000\" id=\"span_5\">27. This Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1837000/\" id=\"a_13\">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Vijay\nBahadur Singh</a>  has laid down that there is no obligation to accept\nthe highest bid. The Government is entitled even to change its policy\nfrom time to time according to the demands of the time. It was\nobserved thus:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;3. It appears to us that the High Court had clearly misdirected itself.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">The Conditions of Auction made it perfectly clear that the\nGovernment was under no obligation to accept the highest bid and\nthat no rights accrued to the bidder merely because his bid happened\nto be the highest. Under Condition 10 it was expressly provided that\nthe acceptance of bid at the time of auction was entirely provisional\nand was subject to ratification by the competent authority, namely,\nthe State Government. Therefore, the Government had the right, for\ngood and sufficient reason, we may say, not to accept the highest bid\nbut even to prefer a tenderer other than the highest bidder.\nThe High Court was clearly in error in holding that the Government\ncould not refuse to accept the highest bid except on the ground of\ninadequacy of the bid. Condition 10 does not so restrict the power of\nthe Government not to accept the bid. There is no reason why the\npower vested in the Government to refuse to accept the highest bid\nshould be confined to inadequacy of bid only. There may be a variety\nof good and sufficient reasons, apart from inadequacy of bids, which\nmay impel the Government not to accept the highest bid. In fact, to\ngive an antithetic illustration, the very enormity of a bid may make\nit suspect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">It may lead the Government to realise that no bona fide bidder could\npossibly offer such a bid if he meant to do honest business. Again the\nGovernment may change or refuse its policy from time to time and\nwe see no reason why change of policy by the Government, \nsubsequent to the auction but before its confirmation, may not be a\nsufficient justification for the refusal to accept the highest bid. It\ncannot be disputed that the Government has the right to change its\npolicy from time to time, according to the demands of the time and\nsituation and in the public interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">If the Government has the power to accept or not to accept the\nhighest bid and if the Government has also the power to change its\npolicy from time to time, it must follow that a change or revision of\npolicy subsequent to the provisional acceptance of the bid but before\nits final acceptance is a sound enough reason for the Government&#x27;s\nrefusal to accept the highest bid at an auction...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">28. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1782785\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/1782785/\" id=\"a_14\">Laxmikant &amp; Ors. v. Satyawan</a> , this Court has laid down that\nin the absence of completed contract when the public auction had\nnot culminated to its logical end before confirmation of the bid, no\nright accrued to the highest bidder. This Court has laid down as\nunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;4. Apart from that the High Court overlooked the conditions of\nauction which had been notified and on basis of which the aforesaid\npublic auction was held. Condition No. 3 clearly said that after the\nauction of the plot was over, the highest bidder had to remit 1/10 of\nthe amount of the highest bid and the balance of the premium\namount was to be remitted to the trust office within thirty days\n&quot;from the date of the letter informing confirmation of the auction\nbid in the name of the person concerned&quot;. Admittedly, no such\nconfirmation letter was issued to the respondent. Conditions Nos. 5,\n6 and 7 are relevant:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;5. The acceptance of the highest bid shall depend on the Board of\nTrustees.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">6. The Trust shall reserve to itself the right to reject the highest or\nany bid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">7.

In recent times, judicial review of administrative action has\nbecome expansive and is becoming wider day by day. The traditional\nlimitations have been vanishing and the sphere of judicial scrutiny is\nbeing expanded. State activity too is becoming fast pervasive. As the\nState has descended into the commercial field and giant public sector\nundertakings have grown up, the stake of the public exchequer is also\nlarge justifying larger social audit, judicial control and review by\nopening of the public gaze; these necessitate recording of reasons for\nexecutive actions including cases of rejection of highest offers.\nThat very often involves large stakes and availability of reasons for\nactions on the record assures credibility to the action; disciplines\npublic conduct and improves the culture of accountability. Looking\nfor reasons in support of such action provides an opportunity for an\nobjective review in appropriate cases both by the administrative\nsuperior and by the judicial process. The submission of Mr Dwivedi,\ntherefore, commends itself to our acceptance, namely, that when\nhighest offers of the type in question are rejected reasons sufficient\nto indicate the stand of the appropriate authority should be made\navailable and ordinarily the same should be communicated to the\nconcerned parties unless there be any specific justification not to do\nso.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">No doubt about it that there have to be some reasons for\nrejection of the bid which are adequately present in the instant\ncase as discussed hereinabove.

Delhi Development Authority</a>  in which this Court has\nlaid down that the highest bid was rejected without assigning any\nreason and there was no record showing that the decision was based \non rational and tangible reasons and was in public interest. In the\ninstant case we are satisfied from the order that the reports were\nconsidered and what were the reports, has been made clear in the\nreply filed by the respondents which has not been controverted. In\nthe instant case merely the bid being above the reserve price, was\nnot a safe criteria to accept the same.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">32. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1831036\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_23\">Mohinder Singh Gill v.

This Court has held thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;8. The second equally relevant matter is that when a statutory\nfunctionary makes an order based on certain grounds, its validity\nmust be judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be  \nsupplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise.\nOtherwise, an order bad in the beginning may, by the time it comes\nto court on account of a challenge, get validated by additional\ngrounds later brought out. We may here draw attention to the\nobservations of Bose, J. in Gordhandas Bhanji AIR 1952 SC 16: &quot;Public\norders, publicly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be\nconstrued in the light of explanations subsequently given by the\nofficer making the order of what he meant, or of what was in his\nmind, or what he intended to do.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public\neffect and are intended to affect the actings and conduct of those to\nwhom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with \nreference to the language used in the order itself.

However, in\nthe instant case reasons have been mentioned in the rejection\norder and the nature of reports has also been sufficiently\nexplained.

Thus, the petitioner-firm merely because it is the L.1 among\nL.1 to L.3 as lowest cannot have any unfettered right before its\nfinalization by acceptance or rejection of the bid as in the meantime it\nis only a conditional one at best and not a contract at all to enforce\nmuchless to impugn by invoking writ jurisdiction in this regard,\nirrespective of the law is fairly settled including from the larger Bench\nexpression of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/509294/\" id=\"a_24\">Bhamidipati Annapoorna Bhavani Vs. \nLand Acquisition Officer, Yeleru Reserve Project</a>  that there are no\nlimitations on the discretionary power of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article\n226</a> of the Constitution of India, however, such power be exercised\nalong recognized lines and not arbitrarily but judiciously and\navailability of alternative and efficacious or statutory remedy itself is\nnot a bar in entertaining a writ petition in the given facts and\ncircumstances.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      7. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"164673968\" id=\"span_16\">In this Court, coming to the expression of the Apex Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/164673968/\" id=\"a_26\">State of Kerala &amp; Others Vs. M.K. Jose</a> , it is in relation to the facts\non termination of a contract awarded to the respondent and forfeiting\nthe security deposit of the petitioners before the Supreme Court,\npursuant to the contract terms.  There the work covered by the\nagreement entered dated 18.12.2010 to complete within 12 months as \nper the terms stipulated that could not be completed, even time is\nextended till 30.06.2012 and again till 31.03.2013 and despite notice\nand instructions failed to complete and thereby the petitioner-\nGovernment represented by Executive Engineer issued direction dated \n14.02.2013 to stop the work also for deviations in the work and revised\nestimate sought to be done not sanctioned and pursuant to which the\nwrit petition was maintained and the High Court disposed of by\ndirecting the Principal Secretary to take a decision on the proposal of\nrevised estimate and the respondent-contractor later filed contempt\npetition against the Principal Secretary that was no doubt dropped and\nhe later filed another writ petition where High Court directed the\nPrincipal Secretary, PWD to consider and pass appropriate orders on\nhis representation made earlier.  Therefrom the Apex Court observed\nthat the facts supra show the attitude of the respondent contractor in\nfiling representations and writ petitions not only two in 2012, but also\n3 more in 2013 in obtaining orders and directions and in the scenario\nthe contract was eventually terminated by PWD department of Kerala.\nThat termination was ultimately assailed in writ petition No.22541 of\n2013 for mandamus with a direction to take steps for measurement of\nwork completed and learned Single Judge of Kerala High Court directed\nso and when assailed in writ appeal, the appellate Court on 17.12.2013\npassed an order saying more than 50% of work remains to be completed  \nfrom Ex.P15 order and the contractors affidavit dated 15.03.2013 in\none of the earlier writ petitions show as if 70% work completed and the\nsubmission as if 90% work completed are not correct.  The Counsel for\nthe Contractor then sought for appointment of an advocate\ncommissioner to substantiate the contentions of 90% of the work\ncompleted and eventually the Division Bench appointed 2 advocates as\ncommissioners to submit joint report and with direction to provide\nnecessary assistance to the Commissioner by permitting them the \npower to call for record from any Office.  The commissioners submitted\ntheir report.  The Bench on the basis of final report held that the order\nof termination is erroneous from the competent authority opined more\nthan 50% work remained to be done as a factual defect, since\ncommissioners report shows otherwise, in quashing said order of\ntermination with a direction to the Superintending Engineer, PWD to\nconsider and dispose of the matter afresh by affording opportunity to\nthe contractor.  Then the issue arisen before the Apex Court where in\nthe factual scenario it is observed that this kind of orders in a contract\nmatter by the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 226</a> of Constitution of India are\nill-conceived by converting the controversy into disturbing labyrinth,\nbut encourage frivolous litigation.  The High Court should not have been\nappointed an advocate commissioner for what precisely was the\nquantum of work done and whether there had been a breach by the \ncontractor are required to be gone into by the appropriate legal forum\nfor writ Court ordinarily should not entertain a matter of breach of\ncontract involving disputed questions of fact.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"460900\" id=\"span_17\">The case on hand\nindicates the same as also held by one of the 2 Judge Bench expression\nof the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/460900/\" id=\"a_28\">State of Bihar Vs. Jain Plastics and Chemicals\nLimited</a>  that where disputed question of law involved and to\nadjudicate the same there is an alternative and efficacious remedy\nopen to the litigant, he should be required to pursue that remedy and\nnot invoke the writ jurisdiction.  Though existence of alternative\nremedy does not affect the jurisdiction to issue writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 226</a>\nof Constitution of India, but for seriously disputed questions or rival\nclaims of the parties with regard to breach of contract raised are to be\ninvestigated and determined in the form of alternative efficacious\nremedy.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191872\" id=\"span_18\">The Apex Court referred other expressions including <a href=\"/doc/191872/\" id=\"a_30\">National\nHighways Authority of India Vs.

The Apex Court observed that the issue involved\nof improper finalization of technical bid of one of the two tenderers of\nwhom one has no qualification is the impugnment and in the public\ninterest which is one of the considerations, in a fight between rival\ntenderers particularly to cater their business interests in seeking re-\ntendering, the Court has to loath to make interference under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_53\">Articles\n226</a> or 32 of the Constitution, irrespective of otherwise maintainability\nof writ. It is also observed that in the absence of malafide or\narbitrariness to favour, no interference was warranted to interfere\nwith the work under progress taken up by the other bidder.

From this now coming to the facts of the case on hand, the\npetitioner-firm is one of the three tenderers since all rejected, so far\npetitioner-firm concerned mainly the rejection of the tender is for\nsuppression of the factum of two works in progress. Even as per the\nwrit petition affidavit averments, it is not its case of it has no\nknowledge of the same or it is not concerned with the works or those\nbelong to somebody but for saying while admitting in Statement-IV, it\ndid not disclose as complained and found of two ongoing works for a\nsum of Rs.4,04,63,454/-, the version is by oversight. It is highly absurd\nto believe the same is outcome of oversight and the same cannot be a\nground thereby for rejection. Its other contention of even taken the\ntwo ongoing works value, it is eligible otherwise is not a ground to\nconsider and the other contention of the said condition in tender is\nonerous also not tenable as the free hand has to be given to the\ntendering authority in setting terms of tender and the judicial\ninterference is minimal but for showing malafide and arbitrary and\nactuated by bias as held referring to several expressions of the Apex\nCourt by this Court another Bench in <a href=\"/doc/141104940/\" id=\"a_55\">Radha Konduri Vs. State of\nA.P.</a> . Thus, the rejection is supported by reasons and well within the\ndiscretion and requires no interference by this writ Court.</span> Further,\ncoming to the subsequent short tender process adopted in view of the\nurgency of the works to complete the school building for the larger\npublic interest of the student community which must be within a span\nof 12 months to complete from the process started in\nOctober/November,2016 and the writ petition filed is on 30.01.2017,\nthe short tenders finalized and work not entrusted to the highest\nbidder therein from the interim direction to that effect of this Court,\ndt.31.01.2017 not in dispute and said highest bidder of short tender\nbid is not before the Court as co-respondent for not to pass any adverse\norder against as observed in Chhattisgarh State Industrial\nDevelopment Corp. Ltd. Supra that in the absence of malafide or\narbitrariness to favour the bidder of the short tender bid process, no\ninterference is warranted of the work to be taken up by the other non-\nparty bidder, no doubt, there for non-interference 50% of the work was\ncompleted and here the bid is not even finalized and the finalization\nitself is subject to result of the present writ petition. Further, on\n20.04.2017 petition in W.P.M.P.No.17767 of 2017 was filed by M/s.Sri\nKrishnarjuna Constructions Firm represented by its Managing\nPartner to come on record as R.5 saying the Department after e-\ntender notification process finalized by rejection of the three\ntenderers, issued short tender notice inviting e-procurement in respect\nof same work covered by the original tender notification, dt.\n05.11.2016 wherein the proposed party as R.5 among two others by \nname K.M.V.Projects Ltd.

That apart the power to blacklist a contractor whether the\ncontract be for supply of material or equipment or for the execution\nof any other work whatsoever is in our opinion inherent in the party\nallotting the contract. There is no need for any such power being\nspecifically conferred by statute or reserved by contractor. That is\nbecause blacklisting simply signifies a business decision by which\nthe party affected by the breach decides not to enter into any\ncontractual relationship with the party committing the breach.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"743328\" id=\"span_39\">Between two private parties the right to take any such decision is\nabsolute and untrammelled by any constraints whatsoever.

All these\nconsiderations that go to determine whether the action is\nsustainable in law have been sanctified by judicial pronouncements\nof this Court and are of seminal importance in a system that is\ncommitted to the rule of law.  We do not consider it necessary to\nburden this judgment by a copious reference to the decisions on the\nsubject.</span></span></span></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1340338\" id=\"span_48\">A reference to the following passage from the decision of\nthis Court in M/s <a href=\"/doc/1340338/\" id=\"a_68\">Mahabir Auto Stores vs. Indian Oil Corporation\nLtd.</a>  should, in our view, suffice:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"467021\" id=\"span_49\">11. It is well settled that every action of the State or an\ninstrumentality of the State in exercise of its executive power, must\nbe informed by reason. In appropriate cases, actions uninformed by\nreason may be questioned as arbitrary in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_69\">Article\n226</a> or <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution. Reliance in this connection may\nbe placed on the observations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/467021/\" id=\"a_71\">Radha Krishna Agarwal\nv. State of Bihar ... In</a> case any right conferred on the citizens\nwhich is sought to be interfered, such action is subject to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 14</a>\nof the Constitution, and must be reasonable and can be taken only\nupon lawful and relevant grounds of public interest. Where there is\narbitrariness in State action of this type of entering or not entering\ninto contracts, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 14</a> springs up and judicial review strikes such\nan action down. Every action of the State executive authority must\nbe subject to rule of law and must be informed by reason. So,\nwhatever be the activity of the public authority, in such monopoly or\nsemi-monopoly dealings, it should meet the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution. If a Governmental action even in the matters of\nentering or not entering into contracts, fails to satisfy the test of\nreasonableness, the same would be unreasonable. It appears to us   \nthat rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and discrimination,\nrules of fair play and natural justice are part of the rule of law\napplicable in situation or action by State instrumentality in dealing\nwith citizens in a situation like the present one. Even though the\nrights of the citizens are in the nature of contractual rights, the\nmanner, the method and motive of a decision of entering or not\nentering into a contract, are subject to judicial review on the\ntouchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair play, natural\njustice, equality and non-discrimination in the type of the\ntransactions and nature of the dealing as in the present case.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">      Thus, it is the power of the authorities concerned if at all to\nblacklist a tenderer or a contractor by passing an order supporting\nby reasons after enquiry and by affording opportunity to show cause\nby mentioning clearly in the show cause notice the proposed action,\nso as to meet though personal hearing is not a mandatory one\nthereafter before taking action, as a part of meeting the principle of\nnatural justice unless it is specifically excluded by mentioning in the\nterms of giving of show cause notice and opportunity to explain for\ntaking action; though rules of natural justice are not embodied rules\nnor can they be lifted to the position of fundamental rights but for\nthe aim is to secure justice and to prevent miscarriage of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"260083\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/260083/\" id=\"a_75\">Chairman, Board of Mining Examination v.

If fairness is shown by the decision maker to\nthe man proceeded against, the form, features and the\nfundamentals of such essential processual propriety being\nconditioned by the facts and circumstances of each situation,\nno breach of natural justice can be complained of. Unnatural\nexpansion of natural justice, without reference to the\nadministrative realities and other factors of a given case, can\nbe exasperating.

Govt. (NCT of Delhi</a>)  held before blacklisting a\ntenderer/contractor from the necessity of serving show cause notice\nas a requisite of the Principles of Natural Justice that way back in\nthe year 1975, this court in the case of M/s. <a href=\"/doc/743328/\" id=\"a_77\">Erusian Equipment &amp;\nChemicals Ltd. v. State of West Bengal</a>  , highlighted the necessity\nof giving an opportunity to such a person by serving a show cause\nnotice thereby giving him opportunity to meet the allegations which\nwere in the mind of the authority contemplating blacklisting of such\na person. This is clear from the reading of Para Nos. 12 and 20 of <a href=\"/doc/743328/\" id=\"a_78\">the\nsaid judgment</a>. Necessitating this requirement, the court observed\nthus:</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">12. Under <a href=\"/doc/1174818/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 298</a> of the Constitution the executive power of the\nUnion and the State shall extend to the carrying on of any trade and\nto the acquisition, holding and disposal of property and the making\nof contracts for any purpose. The State can carry on executive\nfunction by making a law or without making a law. The exercise of\nsuch powers and functions in trade by the State is subject to Part III\nof the Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 14</a> speaks of equality before the law and\nequal protection of the laws. Equality of opportunity should apply to\nmatters of public contracts. The State has the right to trade. The\nState has there the duty to observe equality. An ordinary individual\ncan choose not to deal with any person. The Government cannot \nchoose to exclude persons by discrimination. The order of blacklisting\nhas the effect of depriving a person of equality of opportunity in the\nmatter of public contract. A person who is on the approved list is\nunable to enter into advantageous relations with the Government\nbecause of the order of blacklisting. A person who has been dealing\nwith the Government in the matter of sale and purchase of materials\nhas a legitimate interest or expectation. When the State acts to the\nprejudice of a person it has to be supported by legality.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">20. Blacklisting has the effect of preventing a person from the\nprivilege and advantage of entering into lawful relationship with the\nGovernment for purposes of gains. The fact that a disability is\ncreated by the order of blacklisting indicates that the relevant\nauthority is to have an objective satisfaction. Fundamentals of fair\nplay require that the person concerned should be given an\nopportunity to represent his case before he is put on the blacklist.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"129511\" id=\"span_53\">18. Again, in <a href=\"/doc/129511/\" id=\"a_81\">Raghunath Thakur v. State of Bihar</a>  the\naforesaid principle was reiterated in the following manner:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">4. Indisputably, no notice had been given to the appellant of\nthe proposal of blacklisting the appellant. It was contended on\nbehalf of the State Government that there was no requirement\nin the rule of giving any prior notice before blacklisting any\nperson. Insofar as the contention that there is no requirement\nspecifically of giving any notice is concerned, the respondent is\nright. But it is an implied principle of the rule of law that any\norder having civil consequence should be passed only after\nfollowing the principles of natural justice. It has to be realised\nthat blacklisting any person in respect of business ventures has\ncivil consequence for the future business of the person\nconcerned in any event. Even if the rules do not express so, it\nis an elementary principle of natural justice that parties\naffected by any order should have right of being heard and\nmaking representations against the order. In that view of the\nmatter, the last portion of the order insofar as it directs\nblacklisting of the appellant in respect of future contracts,\ncannot be sustained in law. In the premises, that portion of the\norder directing that the appellant be placed in the blacklist in\nrespect of future contracts under the Collector is set aside. So\nfar as the cancellation of the bid of the appellant is concerned,\nthat is not affected. This order will, however, not prevent the\nState Government or the appropriate authorities from taking\nany future steps for blacklisting the appellant if the Government\nis so entitled to do in accordance with law i.e. after giving the\nappellant due notice and an opportunity of making\nrepresentation. After hearing the appellant, the State\nGovernment will be at liberty to pass any order in accordance\nwith law indicating the reasons there for. We, however, make\nit quite clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the\ncorrectness of otherwise of the allegations made against the\nappellant. The appeal is thus disposed of.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"44248562\" id=\"span_54\">19. Recently, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/44248562/\" id=\"a_82\">Patel Engineering Ltd. v.

The nature of the authority of the State to blacklist the\npersons was considered by this Court ----------------- Though nobody\nhas any right to compel the State to enter into a contract,\neverybody has a right to be treated equally when the State seeks to\nestablish contractual relationships. The effect of excluding a person\nfrom entering into a contractual relationship with the State would be\nto deprive such person to be treated equally with those, who are\nalso engaged in similar activity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">          15. ----------------\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"44248562\" id=\"span_56\">20. Thus, there is no dispute about the requirement of serving\nshow cause notice. We may also hasten to add that once the show  \ncause notice is given and opportunity to reply to the show cause\nnotice is afforded, it is not even necessary to give an oral hearing.\nThe High Court has rightly repudiated the appellant&#x27;s attempt in\nfinding foul with the impugned order on this ground.

To put it otherwise, we are of the opinion that in\norder to fulfill the requirements of principles of natural justice, a\nshow cause notice should meet the following two requirements viz:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">        i) The material/ grounds to be stated on which according to the\nDepartment necessitates an action;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       ii) Particular penalty/action which is proposed to be taken.

It is now well established proposition of law that unless a\nstatutory provision either specifically or by necessary implication\nexcludes the application of any rules of natural justice, in exercise\nof power pre-judicially affecting another must be in conformity with\nthe rules of natural justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"260083\" id=\"span_57\">30) We are conscious of the following words of wisdom\nexpressed by this Court through the pen of Justice Krishna Iyer in\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/260083/\" id=\"a_85\">Chairman, Board of Mining Examination</a> supra in paras-1,13\n&amp; 14:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">1.

But it is equally clear that failure to\nsupply a report of the inquiry officer to the delinquent\nemployee would not [pic] ipso facto result in the proceedings\nbeing declared null and void and the order of punishment\nnonest and ineffective. It is for the delinquent employee to\nplead and prove that non-supply of such report had caused\nprejudice and resulted in miscarriage of justice.

In the first instance, we may point out\nthat no such case was set up by the respondents that by omitting to\nstate the proposed action of blacklisting, the appellant in the show\ncause notice has not caused any prejudice to the appellant.\nMoreover, had the action of black listing being specifically proposed\nin the show cause notice, the appellant could have mentioned as to\nwhy such extreme penalty is not justified. It could have come out\nwith extenuating circumstances defending such an action even if the\ndefaults were there and the Department was not satisfied with the\nexplanation qua the defaults. It could have even pleaded with the\nDepartment not to blacklist the appellant or do it for a lesser period\nin case the Department still wanted to black list the appellant.\nTherefore, it is not at all acceptable that non-mentioning of\nproposed blacklisting in the show cause notice has not caused any\nprejudice to the appellant. This apart, the extreme nature of such a\nharsh penalty like blacklisting with severe consequences, would itself\namount to causing prejudice to the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">      34) For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that the\nimpugned judgment of the High Court does not decide the issue in\ncorrect prospective. The impugned order dated 11.9.2013 passed by\nthe respondents blacklisting the appellant without giving the\nappellant notice thereto, is contrary to the principles of natural\njustice as it was not specifically proposed and, therefore, there was\nno show cause notice given to this effect before taking action of\nblacklisting against the appellant. We, therefore, set aside and quash\nthe impugned action of blacklisting the appellant. The appeals are\nallowed to this extent.

No doubt, as submitted by the learned Standing Counsel for\nrespondents, each case depends on its own facts and in the case on\nhand, the respondents deliberately suppressed the information of two\nongoing works which is mandatory, that disentitled to participate\nincluding for future participation in suspending the participation for\nthe limited period and thereby the short tender process in vogue\ncannot be interdicted and there are no violation of principles of natural\njustice in the case on hand in the factual scenario and the principles\n<a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_90\">laid down in</a> the expressions have no application to say any violation of\nprinciples of natural justice in non-giving of any show cause notice\ninviting reply and its consideration before passing the order as the very\norder is from the suppression of the material facts. For that the\nlearned counsel submits that a decision, it is trite, should not be read\nas a statute.  A decision is an authority for the questions of law\ndetermined by it.  Such a question is determined having regard to the\nfact situation obtaining therein. While applying the ratio, the court\nmay not pick out a word or a sentence from the judgment divorced\nfrom the context in which the said question arose for consideration.  A\njudgment, as is well-known, must be read in its entirety and the\nobservations made therein should receive consideration in the light of\nthe questions raised before it. It is also a trite law that a point not\nraised before a Court would not be an authority on the said question. It\nis trite that any observation made during the course of reasoning in a\njudgment should not be read divorced from the context in which they\nwere used.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1521407\" id=\"span_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"763806\" id=\"span_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57981484\" id=\"span_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"623061\" id=\"span_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1488034\" id=\"span_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1113996\" id=\"span_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201771\" id=\"span_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1612780\" id=\"span_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"797047\" id=\"span_70\">He relied in this regard, the expressions in <a href=\"/doc/797047/\" id=\"a_91\">Punjab National\nBank vs. R.L.

In fact, so far as rejection of the tender of the petitioner-firm\nis concerned, that no way requires interference as concluded supra, so\nalso if at all for forfeiture of 1% of EMD if governed by the terms of the\ntender document. However, for blacklisting of a civil death from what\nthe expressions supra that requires opportunity of reply by meeting\nfrom show cause notice of the reason to take recourse for blacklisting,\nthat is lacking in the case, though it is not a blacklisting practically for\never but for suspending to participate for future tenders in the works\nof the corporation, it is practically blacklisting for a tenure though it is\na short tenure and that also requires the principles of natural justice to\nobserve by show cause notice and inviting reply for responding to the\nprospective action before passing the order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">      18. Having regard to the above and in the result, the Writ\nPetition is allowed in part as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       i). It is from the fact that before taking action for\nsuspending the participation of the petitioner-firm for future\ntendering till 31.03.2017, leave about forfeiting of 1% of EMD as\nper the tender conditions if at all, for there is no show cause\nnotice muchless to suspend his participation for the reason of the\nsuppression of two ongoing works of him worth more than 4 crores\nin the form-IV Statement, same is no doubt deliberate as observed\nsupra and even therefrom to meet the principles of natural justice\nand fair play, said action of suspending the participation of the\npetitioner-firm for future tendering till 31.03.2017, is set aside\nwith a direction to the respondents to issue show cause notice\nfixing time of at least 4 days from date of its service/receipt for\nreply of petitioner-firm and to pass appropriate orders after\nconsidering reply given if any within the stipulated time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      ii). Needless to say the consequence of which is as if\npetitioner-firm participation is not suspended.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      iii). As a corollary the petitioner-firm is to be permitted in\nthe short tender process to apply by fixing time so to apply before\nits finalization with existing applicants/tenderers, unless orders\npassed in the meantime of expiry of time to apply to be fixed, if\nat all blacklisted to reject any such fresh application even in the\nfinalization process of the short tenders.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      iv). It is needless to say including any decision as to\nforfeiture of any amount out of EMD to arrive and enforce\ntherefrom.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       v). The W.P.M.P.No.17767 of 2017 is dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">      vi).
