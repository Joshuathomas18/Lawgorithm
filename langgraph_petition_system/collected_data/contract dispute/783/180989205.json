Clearly, the existence of a valid arbitration\n\n                     agreement falls within the scope of jurisdictional matters to be\n\n                     determined by the arbitral tribunal.

The Honourable Supreme Court elaborated that a prima facie\n\n                     examination is not a full review but a primary first review to weed out\n\n                     manifestly and ex-facie non-existence and invalid arbitration agreements\n\n                     and non-arbitrable disputes. The Honourable Supreme Court observed\n\n                     that at the stage of reference, the court should not decide debatable\n\n                     questions of facts, as referral proceedings are preliminary and summary\n\n                     and not a mini trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                                  31. The Honourable Supreme Court has also observed that while\n\n                     in some cases the court may, to prevent wastage of public and private\n\n                     resources, exercise judicial discretion to conduct an intense yet summary\n\n                     prima facie review, it must remain conscious that it is to assist the\n\n                     arbitration procedure and not usurp jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                                  32. The Honourable Supreme Court held that the Court must\n\n                     balance the twin objectives of avoiding arbitration-obstructing tactics at\n\n                     referral stage, and protecting parties from being forced to arbitrate when\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                     18/58</span>\n\f                                                                       Arb.O.P.(Com.Div) No.302 of 2023\n\n                     a matter is clearly non-arbitrable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">                                  33. Therefore, it is clear that at the referral stage, a party seeking\n\n                     reference to arbitration only needs to demonstrate that prima facie, a\n\n                     valid arbitration agreement is in existence. It follows that a party seeking\n\n                     to oppose the arbitration has to discharge the heavy burden of showing\n\n                     that even prima facie, an arbitration agreement cannot be said to be in\n\n                     existence. If such party cannot satisfy the court of the same, the matter\n\n                     has to be necessarily referred to the arbitral tribunal for full trial. Such\n\n                     limited jurisdiction vested with the court is necessary at the pre-referral\n\n                     stage to appropriately balance the power of the arbitral tribunal with\n\n                     judicial interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">                                  34.
