As per the contract entered into between the\n    parties, the designated date for commencement of\n    the project was the date of issuance of FOA i.e.\n    03.03.2010, and that the scheduled date of\n    completion was 02.10.2011. It appears that the\n    execution of the project was delayed, as a result of\n    which   the    project    was       completed   only   on\n    28.12.2015. The NCCL was issued a completion\n    certificate by the IOCL indicating the date of\n    completion of the project as 28.12.2015. In view of\n    the delay in completion of the project beyond the\n    scheduled date, the NCCL made a request for\n    extension of time vide the communication dated\n    23.05.2016. While the EOT requests were pending\n    with the IOCL, the NCCL submitted its final bill\n    dated   05.08.2016       to   the    Engineer­In­Charge\n    appointed under the contract between the parties.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\f                     // 10 //\n\n    According to the NCCL, the NCCL in its final bill\n    dated 05.08.2016 made a specific reference to the\n    Notified   Claims.    There       were     correspondences\n    between        the        Engineer­In­Charge                and\n    Thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions India (P) Ltd.\n    (hereinafter   referred     to      as    “TKIS”)     pending\n    settlement of the final bill and the request for\n    Extension of Time (EOT). The NCCL responded to\n    the communication dated 01.11.2016 by the TKIS,\n    vide its response dated 02.11.2016. It appears that\n    the NCCL conveyed to TKIS that if its request for\n    EOT    were    considered        favorably    and     if   price\n    adjustment does not exceed 4%, then, all its\n    extra/additional claims including Notified Claims\n    submitted by it through various communications\n    and the final bill should be treated as withdrawn.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">4.3. The   TKIS     having      received         the     aforesaid\n    communication        from     the        NCCL,     made      its\n    recommendations vis­à­vis the request for EOT\n    made by the NCCL. It appears that thereafter, TKIS\n    in its communication dated 13.01.2017, informed\n    NCCL that it had approved EOT for the period\n    between    03.10.2011       to     03.11.2015,       however,\n    without price discount as per Clause 4.4.0.0 of the\n    General    Conditions       of     Contract        (hereinafter\n    referred to as “GCC”) and that for the period falling\n\f                    // 11 //\n\n     between 04.11.2015 to 28.12.2015 which covered\n     the period of 55 days, it had concluded that the\n     delay was attributable to NCCL. Accordingly, TKIS\n     conveyed to NCCL that for the later period, as per\n     Clause 4.4.2.0 of the GCC, a price adjustment\n     discount of 4% would be applicable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">4.4. It is the case on behalf of NCCL that being\n     aggrieved, it wrote to the IOCL on 23.01.2017 to\n     reconsider its decision and accord EOT upto the\n     date of completion i.e. 28.12.2015 without making\n     any adjustment towards price as indicated in the\n     communication dated 13.01.2017.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">4.5. That, thereafter, the IOCL released a sum of\n     Rs.4,53,04,021/­, the amount calculated as per\n     the   communication    dated    13.01.2017,      after\n     making due adjustments towards taxes etc.\n\n\n4.6. It appears that subsequently and after a period of\n     6&amp;1/2 months (after the settlement of the claim)\n     and after receiving the final bill payment 8 days\n     earlier, on 08.05.2017, vide communication dated\n     16.05.2017,   NCCL    reneged   on    the   letter   of\n     02.11.2016 and alleged that it was made to\n     withdraw its claim under coercion and it had\n     withdrawn its Notified Claims as TKIS vide its\n     communication dated 01.11.2016, had indicated\n\f                          // 12 //\n\n     that the review of the final bill and request for EOT\n     would be considered only if it gave up its insistence\n     on its Notified Claims being considered.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">4.7. That IOCL sent its response vide communication\n     dated 06.06.2017, wherein it stated that none of\n     the claims mentioned in the final bill were Notified\n     Claims.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">4.8. In   the   above      backdrop,     NCCL      invoked     the\n     arbitration clause contained in the Agreement on\n     01.07.2017. That, the IOCL, in accordance with\n     Clause     9.0.2.0    referred    the     matter    regarding\n     arbitrability of NCCL’s claims to the General\n     Manager on 12.07.2017.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">4.9. Vide the communication / letter dated 10.11.2017,\n     the General Manager held that the claims cannot\n     be referred to arbitration and that the Arbitration\n     Agreement itself does not survive on account of\n     NCCL withdrawing its Notified Claims. The General\n     Manager held that therefore there exist no dispute\n     to be referred to arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">4.10.Thereafter the respondent – NCCL approached the\n     Delhi High Court by filing Arbitration Petition\n     No.115/2018          under      <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_4\">Section     11(6)</a>    of   the\n     Arbitration Act for appointment of sole Arbitrator.\n     The said petition was opposed by the IOCL on a\n\f                           // 13 //\n\n          number of grounds. However, by overruling all the\n          objections raised on behalf of the appellant – IOCL,\n          by the impugned judgment and order, the High\n          Court has allowed the said arbitration petition and\n          appointed the sole Arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">     4.11.Impugned judgment and order passed by the High\n          Court dated 08.02.2019 in Arbitration Petition\n          No.115/2018 is the subject matter of present Civil\n          Appeal No.341/2022 (arising out of Special Leave\n          Petition No.13161/2019).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">5.   With respect to other four contracts between the same\n     parties and with same arbitration clauses, the NCCL’s\n     claims were sent to the General Manager under Clause\n     9.0.2.0 of the GCC. So far as the Civil Appeal arising out\n     of SLP No.13408/2019 is concerned, the NCCL did not\n     approach the General Manager but the Arbitration\n     Petition filed before the High Court was forwarded by the\n     IOCL to the General Manager for its determination\n     under Clause 9.0.2.0 of the GCC. That, in all the\n     remaining four cases (Civil Appeal Nos.342/2022 to\n     345/2022), the General Manager declared that none of\n     the claims were Notified Claims.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">6.   Thereafter the NCCL approached the High Court by way\n     of   Arbitration   Petition   Nos.115/2018,    356/2018,\n     116/2018, 407/2018 and 406/2018.

Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General has\n     appeared on behalf of the appellant – IOCL and Shri\n     Ranjith Kumar, learned Senior Advocate has appeared\n     on behalf of the respondent – NCCL.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">8.   Shri   K.K.   Venugopal,        learned   Attorney   General\n     appearing on behalf of the IOCL has vehemently\n     submitted that in the present case both the parties are\n     governed by the terms of the contract entered into\n     between the parties viz. the GCC. That in fact, both the\n     parties are governed by the procedure to be followed in\n     case of dispute between the parties, more particularly\n     contained in the GCC and the arbitration clause.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">8.1 It is further submitted by the learned Attorney General\n     that party autonomy is the backbone of arbitration and\n     the terms of the contract have to be interpreted in the\n     way the parties wanted and intended them to be. In this\n     regard reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court\n     in the case of Centrotrade Minerals &amp; Metal Inc. v.\n\f                                // 15 //\n\n      Hindustan Copper Ltd. reported in (2017) 2 SCC 228\n      (Paras 38­42).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">8.2   It is submitted by the learned Attorney General that\n      there are three categories of contracts which could arise\n      for consideration, which can be summarized as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      (i)    Where no arbitration agreement exists at all. As the\n      arbitration agreement itself is an independent contract\n      and is consensual in nature, it is left to the parties to\n      include an arbitration agreement in the underlying\n      contract, or not to include it. If no arbitration agreement\n      exists in a contract, the only option if a dispute arises\n      for either party is to go by way of a suit;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      (ii)   An   arbitration    agreement    can    exist   in   the\n      underlying contract or outside the contract, which is\n      absolute in terms. This is the standard arbitration\n      clause, and would be in the nature of “where any\n      dispute arises between the parties in relation to the\n      interpretation or implementation of this contract, it shall\n      be referred to arbitration under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_6\">Arbitration and\n      Conciliation     Act,     1996</a>...”   This     would    be   an\n      UNRESTRICTED or ABSOLUTE arbitration clause.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">      In such a case, in the background of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a>(6­A), no\n      question of the Court declining to refer the matter to\n      arbitration would arise, if it finds that the arbitration\n\f                             // 16 //\n\n      agreement exists and is valid. In such a case, every\n      dispute between the parties has to be referred to\n      arbitration because <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11</a>(6­A) would mandate this;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">      (iii) The third category would be where the parties\n      agree     to   have   an   arbitration   clause   but   also\n      consensually agree that certain specified disputes alone\n      will be the subject of arbitration. This would mean that\n      no arbitration clause exists in regard to all other\n      disputes, and no arbitration clause would exist in\n      regard to the ‘excepted’ or ‘excluded’ disputes. In such a\n      case, <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 11</a>(6­A) itself cannot be invoked as no\n      arbitration clause exists in regard to these other\n      disputes. This would be a RESTRICTED arbitration\n      clause.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">8.3   It is further submitted by the learned Attorney General\n      that when all the conditions mentioned in the GCC are\n      satisfied and the procedure is followed and only with\n      respect to the restricted arbitration clauses and with\n      respect to the Notified Claims only the dispute between\n      the parties can be referred to the arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"164803491\" id=\"span_7\">8.4   It is submitted that there are umpteen number of\n      examples of restricted arbitration clauses.

However, the instant case is a case of a\n      restricted arbitration clause that specifically excludes\n      certain issues from arbitration, as a result of which, no\n      arbitration clause exists for those ‘other’ or ‘excepted’\n      disputes and hence, the question of referring those\n      disputes would not arise.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_13\">That in the case of <a href=\"/doc/121987320/\" id=\"a_20\">Vidya\n      Drolia</a> (supra), the Arbitration Agreement itself sets out\n      what is excluded from arbitration. Therefore, it was held\n      that <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a>(6­A) would not stand in the way of\n      making a reference.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">8.8   It is further submitted by learned Attorney General that\n      in the present case the respondent NCCL received the\n      amount of final bill in full settlement of their claims.\n      That in the present case the arbitration clause itself\n      states that where the final bill amount has been received\n      by the party, or where a sum has been received on\n      account of Notified Claims, the arbitration clause itself\n      stands extinguished. Therefore, the fact that amount of\n      final bill having been received in full settlement cannot\n\f                             // 19 //\n\n      be the subject matter of reference by any specific\n      stipulation in the contract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">8.9   Learned Attorney General has taken us to the relevant\n      clauses of the GCC more particularly Clauses 1.21.0.0,\n      6.6.0.0,   6.6.1.0,   6.6.2.0,   6.6.3.0,   6.6.3.1,   6.6.4.0,\n      6.6.5.0,   6.6.6.0,   6.7.0.0,   6.7.1.0,   6.7.2.0,   6.7.3.0,\n      9.0.0.0, 9.0.1.0, 9.0.1.1, 9.0.2.0 and 9.0.3.0. It is\n      contended that as per Clause 9.0.1.0, the only matter to\n      which a reference to arbitration can be sought is a\n      “Notified Claim” included in the final bill and to no other\n      dispute. That all disputes other than Notified Claims\n      included in the final bill, have to be pursued by way of a\n      suit.

It is\n     submitted that the arbitration clause itself is subject to\n     Clauses 6.7.1.0 and 6.7.2.0. It is submitted that Clause\n     6.7.2.0 dealing with “Notified Claims” expressly declares\n     that the acceptance of any amount by the contractor in\n     respect of the Notified Claims shall result in full and\n     final satisfaction of the claims by the contractor in\n     respect of the Notified Claims and hence, the contract,\n     including the arbitration clause, shall stand discharged\n     and extinguished. This is as per Clause 6.7.2.0 itself,\n     notwithstanding any qualifying remarks, protest or\n     condition imposed or purported to be imposed by the\n     contractor relative to the acceptance of such payment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">8.15 It is submitted that applying these principles to the\n     present   case,   NCCL’s     express     statement    dated\n     02.11.2016 is     required   to   be   appreciated   and/or\n\f                         // 22 //\n\n    considered. That pursuant to the said statement by the\n    NCCL, the IOCL (petitioner) levied a price adjustment of\n    only 4% as opposed to 10%; and the respondent\n    expressly withdrew its Notified Claims. It is submitted\n    that the IOCL also paid the dues as per the final bill.\n    The Notified Claims, having been withdrawn, therefore,\n    could not more be the subject matter of any reference to\n    arbitration. It is submitted that as a result of the\n    acceptance by the NCCL of the amount paid pursuant to\n    its final bill, and the Notified Claims having been\n    withdrawn, and the result of Clauses 6.7.1.0 and\n    6.7.2.0, the contract, including the arbitration clause\n    stands discharged and extinguished and therefore,\n    subsequently, no reference to arbitration could be made.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">8.16 It is submitted that it is only 6½ months later, on\n    16.05.2017 and after receiving the final bill payment 8\n    days earlier on 08.05.2017, that the NCCL reneged on\n    its letter withdrawing its demand in regard to Notified\n    Claims. It is submitted that the reason why the NCCL\n    withdrew their demand for payment of the full amount\n    of final bill including Notified Claims is that if 10% has\n    been deducted due to the delay, an amount of Rs.14.8\n    Crores would have been deducted from the payment of\n    NCCL. It is submitted that having received Rs.151\n    Crores against the contract of Rs.148 Crores, the NCCL\n    was well aware that in such an eventuality, it would\n    have received no amount against the final bill and its\n\f                             // 23 //\n\n     bank guarantee would also have been invoked. That in\n     fact by withdrawing the demand, the respondent was\n     now able to get Rs.4.53 Crores as well as the return of\n     the bank guarantee of Rs.14.8 Crores.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">8.17 It is further submitted that Clause 9.0.2.0 of the GCC\n     specifically excludes certain matters, such as disputes\n     concerning the scope of the arbitration agreement, viz.,\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">     (i) whether or not a claim is a Notified Claim; (ii) whether\n     or not a Notified Claim is included in the contractor’s\n     bill etc.; from the scope, purview and ambit of the\n     Arbitration Agreement. It is submitted that under sub­\n     Clause (iii) thereof, a Notified Claim covered by a\n     decision of the General Manager is specifically an\n     excluded matter. It is submitted that in the present case\n     the General Manager rejected the demand of the NCCL\n     in regard to the Notified Claims, particularly as the\n     demand    in   regard    to   ‘Notified   Claims’   had   been\n     specifically withdrawn by the NCCL. It is submitted\n     therefore that viewed from any angle, as no arbitration\n     clause existed so far as the NCCL is concerned, the High\n     Court has committed a serious error in referring the\n     dispute between the parties to Arbitrator and appointing\n     the Arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">8.18 Now, so far as the other four cases are concerned, the\n     learned Attorney General has submitted that in those\n     four cases the claims were referred / sent to the General\n\f                               // 24 //\n\n      Manager under Clause 9.0.2.0 of the GCC. That in all\n      the remaining cases the General Manager declared that\n      none of the claims of the NCCL was a Notified Claim.\n      Therefore, the claims which are found by the General\n      Manager not to be Notified Claims are not arbitrable and\n      are outside the scope and purview of the Arbitration\n      Agreement. It is submitted that in that view of the\n      matter, the High Court ought to have dismissed the\n      applications / petitions filed by the NCCL under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n      11</a> of the Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">            Making   above     submissions   and   relying   upon\n      decisions, it is prayed to allow the present appeals and\n      set aside the respective orders passed by the High Court\n      referring the dispute between the parties to arbitration\n      and appointing the sole Arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">9.

Further, Clause 9.0.2.0\n      creates a machinery whereby IOCL has unbridled power\n      conferred upon its General Manager to certify if a claim\n      is capable of being referred to arbitration. The said\n      clause, according to IOCL vests the sole discretion of\n      deciding the arbitrability of claims on the General\n      Manager.     It   is   submitted   that,   as   such,   the\n\f                             // 30 //\n\n      interpretation of the Clause as suggested by IOCL, is in\n      derogation of not only the arbitrator’s power to decide\n      arbitrability, but also the Court’s power under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n      11</a> of the Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_67\">9.5   It is submitted that the said Clause would indicate that\n      the General Manager is only supposed to see if the claim\n      raised by the respondent is (i) a Notified Claim as\n      defined under Clause 1.21.0.0 r/W. Clause 6.6.1.0; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">      (ii) whether the Notified Claim is included in the final bill\n      in accordance with Clause 6.6.3.0. That the General\n      Manager is not empowered under the said Clause to\n      state that a claim is not arbitrable due to full and final\n      settlement between the parties or due to a claim being\n      an excepted claim.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">9.6   It is submitted that in the present case, the IOCL has\n      admitted that the claims raised by the respondent are\n      ‘Notified Claims’ and this fact has never been disputed\n      by the IOCL or its General Manager. It is submitted that\n      even the second condition is also fulfilled as the\n      respondent’s final bill includes its Notified Claims. It is\n      submitted that thus the only logical conclusion which\n      follows is that the Notified Claims raised by the\n      respondent should have been referred to arbitration.\n      However, the General Manager of the IOCL, in two\n      cases, denied referring the Notified Claims to arbitration\n      on the ground that there was full and final settlement\n\f                            // 31 //\n\n      between the parties, and in other three cases the\n      General Manager has denied referring the Notified\n      Claims to arbitration on the ground that they are\n      ‘excepted claims’.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">9.7   It is submitted that as per the GCC, the General\n      Manager is not entitled to resist the reference of a\n      Notified Claim to arbitration on the ground of accord\n      and satisfaction. That the aspect pertaining to full and\n      final settlement between the parties, forms part of\n      Clauses 6.7.1.0 and 6.7.2.0 and not of Clause 9.0.2.0.\n      That, in fact, Clause 6.7.1.0 expressly provides that\n      upon payment of sums under the final bill, there shall\n      be full and final settlement, without prejudice to the\n      Notified Claims of the contractor included in the final\n      bill. It is submitted that therefore, even after the\n      payment of money on 08.05.2017, Notified Claims are\n      neither settled nor is there full and final settlement in\n      respect of Notified Claims. It is submitted that insofar as\n      ‘excepted claims’ are concerned, as per Clause 9.0.2.0,\n      once the General Manager comes to a decision that a\n      claim is a Notified Claim and the same is included in the\n      final bill, he is duty bound to refer the claim to\n      arbitration. It is submitted that therefore the reasoning\n      behind the decision rendered by the General Manager\n      that the claims are not Notified Claims is not only\n      unsustainable, but is also ex facie contrary to Clause\n      9.0.2.0. It is submitted that Clause 9.0.2.0 does not\n\f                               // 32 //\n\n      render the decision of the General Manager final.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"133653680\" id=\"span_22\">9.8   It is further submitted that vide the Amendment Act,\n      2015, <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_37\">section 11</a>(6­A) has been inserted by virtue of\n      which, the scope of intervention at <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 11</a> stage is\n      very narrow.

It is further observed that thus the contract\n    being a creature of an agreement between two or more\n    parties has to be interpreted giving literal meanings\n    unless there is some ambiguity therein. The contract is\n    to be interpreted giving the actual meaning to the words\n    contained in the contract and it is not permissible for\n    the Court to make a new contract, however reasonable,\n    if the parties have not made it themselves. It is further\n    observed that the terms of the contract have to be\n    construed strictly without altering the nature of a\n    contract as it may affect the interest of either of the\n    parties adversely (Para 23).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82467323\" id=\"span_36\">10.7 In the case of <a href=\"/doc/82467323/\" id=\"a_75\">Mitra Guha Builders (India) Company</a>\n    (supra), while interpreting the clause by which the\n    parties agreed that the decision of the Superintending\n    Engineer in levying compensation is final and the same\n    is an ‘excepted matter’ and the determination shall be\n    only   by   the   Superintending   Engineer    and   the\n    correctness of his decision cannot be called in question\n    in the arbitration proceedings and the remedy, if any,\n    will arise in the ordinary course of law, the Three\n    Judges Bench of this Court after referring to and\n\f                           // 42 //\n\n    considering the earlier decisions on the point observed\n    and held that once the parties have decided that certain\n    matters are to be decided by the Superintending\n    Engineer and his decision would be final, the same\n    cannot be the subject matter of arbitration.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"164803491\" id=\"span_37\">10.8 In the case of <a href=\"/doc/164803491/\" id=\"a_76\">Harsha Construction</a> (supra), while\n    interpreting the clause in the agreement by which some\n    of the disputes were specifically not arbitrable and in\n    relation to the said disputes the contractor had to\n    negotiate with the Engineer concerned and if the\n    contractor was not satisfied with the rate determined by\n    the Engineer, the contractor was required to follow the\n    procedure mentioned in the said clause and in this\n    regard, in paras 18 and 19, it is observed and held as\n    under:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">         “18.

As per Clause 6.6.1.0, the\n    contractor shall have to give notice in writing of his\n    claim   with   respect   to   any    extra   payment    or\n    compensation in respect of the works over and above\n    the amounts due in terms of the contract or on the\n    validity of any deductions made or threatened by the\n    owner from any running account bills, by giving notice\n    in writing of his claim in this behalf to the Engineer­in­\n    Charge and the Site Engineer within ten days from the\n    date of issue of the orders or instructions relative to any\n    works for which the contractor claims such additional\n    payment… etc. Such notice shall give full particulars of\n    the nature of such claim, grounds on which it is based\n    and the amount claimed. It also further provides that\n    the owner shall not in any way be liable to in respect of\n    any claim by the contractor unless notice of such claim\n    shall have been given by the contractor to the Engineer­\n    in­Charge and the Site Engineer. It also further provides\n    that a contractor shall be deemed to have waived any\n    and all claims and all his rights in respect of any claim\n    not notified to the Engineer­in­Charge and the Site\n    Engineer in writing in the manner and within the time\n    (ten days from the date of issue of the orders or\n    instructions). It further provides that all such claims\n    otherwise valid within the provisions of Clause 6.6.1.0\n\f                           // 51 //\n\n    read with Clauses 6.6.3.0 and 6.6.3.1 shall have to be\n    dealt with/considered by the owner at the time of\n    submission of the Final Bill and that any action on the\n    part of the owner (Engineer­in­Charge or Site Engineer)\n    to reject any claim made or notified by the contractor or\n    delay in dealing therewith shall be deemed to be an\n    admission by the owner of the validity of such claim or\n    waiver by the owner of any of its rights in respect\n    thereof.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">11.2 As per Clause 6.6.3.0, any claims of the contractor\n    notified in accordance with the provision of Clause\n    6.6.1.0 and remain due at the time of preparation of\n    Final Bill by the contractor, shall have to be separately\n    included in the Final Bill prepared by the contractor in\n    the form of a Statement of Claims attached thereto,\n    giving particulars of the nature of the claim, grounds on\n    which it is based, and the amount claimed and shall be\n    supported by a copy of the notice sent in respect thereof\n    by the contractor to the Engineer­in­Charge and the Site\n    Engineer under Clause 6.6.1.0. It further provides that\n    any variance with the claim notified by the contractor\n    within the provision of Clause 6.6.1.0 shall be deemed\n    to be a claim different from the Notified Claim with\n    consequence in respect thereof indicated in Clauses\n    6.6.1.0 and 6.6.3.1.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">11.3 Clause 6.6.3.1 further provides that the owner (IOCL)\n\f                         // 52 //\n\n    shall not in any way be liable in respect of any Notified\n    Claim not specifically reflected in the Final Bill in\n    accordance with the provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0.

It\n    further provides that any such claim shall be deemed to\n    have been waived and with respect to all such claims\n    not included in the Final Bill, the owner (IOCL) is\n    absolved and discharged, even if not including the same,\n    the contractor shall have acted under the mistake of law\n    or fact.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">         Thus, on a fair reading of the aforesaid provisions,\n    it can be seen that only those claims which are Notified\n    after following the procedure as referred to hereinabove\n    shall be considered as “Notified Claim” and in respect of\n    any claim other than the Notified Claim, the owner is\n    not liable to pay and as such is absolved and discharged\n\f                                // 53 //\n\n     under the said clauses.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">11.5 The next important clause is 6.7.0.0 with respect to the\n     discharge of owner’s liability.

The said clause is for Alternative\n    Dispute Resolution Machinery. As per Clause 9.0.1.0,\n    subject to the earlier Clauses, namely Clauses 6.7.1.0,\n    6.7.2.0 and 9.0.2.0, any dispute arising out of a\n    NOTIFIED CLAIM of the contractor included in the\n    Final Bill of the contractor in accordance with the\n    provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0 and if the contractor has\n    not   opted   for   the    Alternative   Dispute   Resolution\n    Machinery referred to in Clause 9.1.1.0 and any dispute\n    arising out of any Claim of the owner against the\n    contractor shall be referred to the arbitration of a Sole\n    Arbitrator. It also further provides that the owner may\n    prefer its Claims against the contractor as counter­\n    claims if a Notified Claim of the contractor has been\n    referred to arbitration. It also further provides that the\n    contractor shall not, however, be entitled to raise as a\n    set­off, defence or counter­claim any claim which is not\n    a NOTIFIED CLAIM included in the contractor’s Final\n\f                          // 55 //\n\n     Bill in accordance with the provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">11.8 Clause 9.0.2.0 is an exclusion clause by which, certain\n     matters are specifically excluded from the scope,\n     purview and ambit of the Arbitration Agreement. It pro­\n     vides that disputes or differences with respect to or con­\n     cerning   or   relating   to    any   of   the    matters\n     mentioned/specified in Clause 9.0.2.0 are excluded\n     from the scope, purview and ambit of the arbitration\n     agreement. It further provides that any such matter\n     which is specifically excluded viz. (i) with respect to or\n     concerning the scope or existence or otherwise of the Ar­\n     bitration Agreement; (ii) whether or not a Claim sought\n     to be referred to arbitration by the contractor is a Noti­\n     fied Claim; (iii) whether or not a Notified Claim is in­\n     cluded in the contractor’s Final Bill in accordance with\n     the provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0 and (iv) whether or not\n     the contractor has opted for the Alternative Dispute Res­\n     olution Machinery with respect to any Notified Claim in­\n     cluded in the contractor’s Final Bill shall have to be de­\n     cided by the General Manager prior to the arbitration\n     proceeding with or proceeding further with the reference\n     and the Arbitrator or the Arbitral Tribunal shall have no\n     jurisdiction to entertain the same or to render any deci­\n     sion with respect to such matters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">\f                      // 56 //\n\n     Thus, on a fair reading of clause 9.0.0.0, only the\ndispute arising out of a NOTIFIED CLAIM of the con­\ntractor included in the FINAL BILL in accordance with\nthe provisions of Clause 6.6.3.0 shall be referred to arbi­\ntration, that too, subject to Clause 9.0.2.0 and any dis­\npute / matter falling within Clause 9.0.2.0 shall have to\nbe first decided by the General Manager, including,\nwhether or not a Claim sought to be referred to arbitra­\ntion by the contractor is a Notified Claim. Therefore, if\nthe claim is not a Notified Claim, as per Clause 6.6.1.0\nand the same is not included in the Final Bill, such a\nclaim is outside the purview of the arbitration agree­\nment. Whether or not a claim sought for arbitration by\nthe contractor is a Notified Claim or any such matter /\ndispute is specifically excluded from the scope, purview\nand ambit of arbitration agreement, such matter / dis­\npute shall have to be first decided by the General Man­\nager prior to the arbitral proceeding with or proceeding\nfurther with the reference. Thus, unless there is a deci­\nsion by the General Manager on whether or not a claim\nsought to be referred to arbitration by the contractor is a\nNotified Claim or not, the Arbitrator or Arbitral Tribunal\nshall have no jurisdiction to entertain such a dispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\">     The aforesaid clauses of the GCC are part of the\ncontract between the parties herein and both the parties\nare bound by the aforesaid claims.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">\f                            // 57 //\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_123\">12.   It is the case on behalf of the petitioner IOCL that the\n      IOCL had settled the claim of respondent – NCCL\n      accepting NCCL’s offer to grant extension of time; not to\n      give price adjustment of over 4% of the total contract\n      value and consequently IOCL condoned the delay of\n      1493 days and granted extension of time without\n      applying any price discount. Further for the delay of 65\n      days, IOCL applied the price discount of Rs.6,44,40,021\n      i.e. 4% of the total value of contract and thereafter IOCL\n      released   the   payment   of   Rs.4,53,04,021/­   against\n      NCCL’s final bill (adjusting price discount of Rs.6.4\n      Crores as against Rs.14.8 Crores) and also returned\n      NCCL’s Bank Guarantee which came to be fully\n      accepted by the respondent NCCL. It is the case of IOCL\n      that thereafter, it was not open for the respondent to\n      raise any further claim. Therefore, it is the case on\n      behalf of the petitioner that, there being ‘accord and\n      satisfaction’ for the claim, being an ‘excepted claim’, it\n      was not open for the respondent to invoke the\n      arbitration agreement and request for appointment of an\n      Arbitrator. It is also the case on behalf of the petitioner\n      IOCL that in view of the specific decisions by the\n      General Manager, on “Notified Claims”, in view of Clause\n      9.0.2.0, for the same claims which are not held to be\n      ‘Notified Claims’ by the General Manager, the matter\n      cannot be referred to the Arbitrator in view of the clause\n      pertaining to excluded matters.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_124\">\f                             // 58 //\n\n\n         On the other hand, it is the case on behalf of the\n    respondent      that    acceptance         of     the   amount      of\n    Rs.4,53,04,021/­ was under duress and coercion. It is\n    also the case on behalf of the respondent that earlier\n    offer dated 02.11.2016 was a conditional one and was in\n    the nature of an offer and subsequently when the offer\n    was partially allowed, the respondent without any delay\n    communicated that the decision to partially allow its\n    application for EOT is unacceptable as the same is not\n    in accordance with the conditional offer given by the\n    respondent.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">12.1 Now, so far as the General Manager’s decision on\n    Notified Claims is concerned, it is the case on behalf of\n    the respondent that even the decision of the General\n    Manager on the Notified Claims will always be subject to\n    the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. By the impugned\n    judgment and order the High Court concluded and\n    summed up as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">         “81.

Thus,\nexcept for an open and shut case which throws up a\ncircumstance indicative of the fact that a particular\ndispute does it not fall within the four corners of the\narbitration agreement obtaining between the parties\nthe matter would have to be resolved by an Arbitral\nTribunal. In other words, if there is contestation on\nthis score, the Court will allow the Arbitral Tribunal to\nreach a conclusion one way or another. This approach\nwould be in keeping with the doctrine of Kompetenz\n\f                            // 60 //\n\n           Kompetenz; a doctrine which has statutory recognition\n           under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_50\">13.   Having   heard    learned   Counsel       appearing   for   the\n      respective parties and in the facts and circumstances of\n      the case, the issue / aspect with regard to ‘accord and\n      satisfaction’ of claims is seriously disputed and is\n      debatable. Whether, in view of the acceptance of\n      Rs.4,53,04,021/­ by the respondent NCCL which was\n      released by IOCL on the offer / letter made by the\n      respondent NCCL dated 02.11.2016 there is an instance\n      of ‘accord and satisfaction’ of the claims is a good and\n      reasonably arguable case. It cannot be said to be an\n      open and shut case. Therefore, even when it is observed\n      and held that such an aspect with regard to ‘accord and\n      satisfaction’ of the claims may/can be considered by the\n      Court at the stage of deciding <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 11</a> application, it\n      is always advisable and appropriate that in cases of\n      debatable   and    disputable    facts,    good   reasonably\n      arguable case, the same should be left to the Arbitral\n      Tribunal. Similar view is expressed by this Court in the\n      case of <a href=\"/doc/121987320/\" id=\"a_108\">Vidya Drolia</a> (supra). Therefore, in the facts and\n      circumstances of the case, though it is specifically\n      observed and held that aspects with regard to ‘accord\n      and satisfaction’ of the claims can be considered by the\n      Court at the stage of deciding <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 11(6)</a> application,\n      in the facts and circumstances of the case, the High\n      Court has not committed any error in observing that\n\f                          // 61 //\n\n    aspects with regard to ‘accord and satisfaction’ of the\n    claims or where there is a serious dispute will have to be\n    left to the Arbitral Tribunal. However, at the same time,\n    we do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by the\n    High Court that after the insertion of Sub­Section (6­A)\n    in <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act, scope of inquiry by\n    the Court in <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 11</a> petition is confined only to\n    ascertain as to whether or not a binding arbitration\n    agreement exists qua the parties before it, which is\n    relatable to the disputes at hand. We are of the opinion\n    that though the Arbitral Tribunal may have jurisdiction\n    and authority to decide the disputes including the\n    question of jurisdiction and non­arbitrability, the same\n    can also be considered by the Court at the stage of\n    deciding <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 11</a> application if the facts are very clear\n    and glaring and in view of the specific clauses in the\n    agreement binding between the parties, whether the\n    dispute is non­arbitrable and/or it falls within the\n    excepted clause. Even at the stage of deciding <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_113\">Section\n    11</a> application, the Court may prima facie consider even\n    the aspect with regard to ‘accord and satisfaction’ of the\n    claims.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">13.1 Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\n    respective parties on the decision of the General\n    Manager     on   Notified   Claims     in   Civil   Appeal\n    No.341/2022 arising out of SLP (C) No.13161/2019 is\n    concerned, the General Manager has decided / declared\n\f                             // 62 //\n\n     that the claims are not arbitrable since they had been\n     settled    and   the   arbitration   agreement   has   been\n     discharged under Clause 6.7.2.0 of the GCC and no\n     longer existed / subsisted. As observed hereinabove, the\n     claims had been settled or not is a debatable and\n     disputable question, which is to be left to be decided by\n     the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, matters related to the\n     Notified Claims in the facts and circumstances of the\n     case also shall have to be left to be decided by the\n     Arbitral Tribunal as in the fact situation the aspect of\n     ‘accord and satisfaction’ and ‘Notified Claims’ both are\n     interconnected and interlinked.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">13.2 Now, so far as the Civil Appeal No.342/2022 arising out\n     of SLP (C) No.13816/2019 is concerned, the General\n     Manager in exercise of powers under Clause 9.0.2.0 had\n     declared that none of the claims of the respondent is a\n     Notified    Claim.     From   the    communication     dated\n     22.06.2018, it appears that the General Manager, after\n     elaborately dealing with all the alleged Notified Claims of\n     the respondent has thereafter found that none of the\n     claims made by the respondent is a Notified Claim. On a\n     conjoint reading of the relevant clauses of the GCC viz.\n     Clauses 9.0.1.0 and 9.0.2.0, the dispute arising out of\n     Notified Claims only, which is included in the Final Bill\n     of the contractor can be referred to arbitration. However,\n     as per Clause 9.0.2.0, any dispute or difference on\n     whether or not a claim sought to be referred to\n\f                       // 63 //\n\narbitration by the contractor is a Notified Claim falls\nwithin the excluded matters and the Arbitrator or\nArbitral Tribunal shall have no jurisdiction and/or\nauthority with respect thereto. The dispute or difference\nwhether or not a claim sought to be referred to\narbitration by the contractor is a Notified Claim shall\nnot and cannot form the subject matter of any reference\nor submission to arbitration. Therefore, on a fair and\nconjoint reading of Clause 9.0.1.0 and 9.0.2.0, it can\nsafely be concluded that (i) only the Notified Claims of\nthe contractor included in the Final Bill of the\ncontractor in accordance with the provisions of Clause\n6.6.3.0 shall have to be referred to arbitration; (ii)\nwhether or not a claim sought to be referred to\narbitration by the contractor is a Notified Claim or not,\nthe Arbitrator or Arbitral Tribunal shall have no\njurisdiction at all; (iii) whether or not a claim is a\nNotified Claim or not shall have to be decided by the\nGeneral Manager and that too, prior to arbitration\nproceeding    with    or    proceeding        further   with   the\nreference. Therefore, once the General Manager, on the\nbasis of the material on record takes a conscious\ndecision that a particular claim sought to be referred to\narbitration is not a Notified Claim, such a claim\nthereafter   cannot    be    referred    to     arbitration.

As observed by this Court in a catena of\n     decisions, unless the effect of agreement results in\n     performance of an unlawful act, an agreement, which is\n     otherwise legal, cannot be held to be void and is binding\n     between the parties. At this stage, the decision of this\n     Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/94862/\" id=\"a_114\">Sreekanth Transport</a> (supra) is\n     required to be referred to. In the case before this Court,\n     the contract provided for exclusion of some matters from\n     the purview of arbitration. A senior officer of the\n     department was given the authority and power to\n     adjudicate the same. One of the clauses provided that\n     the decision of the Senior Officer, being the Adjudicator,\n     shall be final and binding between the parties. This\n     Court considered the same as ‘excepted matters’. In the\n     aforesaid decision, it is observed and held in paragraph\n     3 as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">          “3. “Excepted matters” obviously, as the parties\n          agreed, do not require any further adjudication since\n          the agreement itself provides a named adjudicator ­\n          concurrence to the same obviously is presumed by\n          reason of the unequivocal acceptance of the terms of\n          the contract by the parties and this is where the courts\n          have found out lacking in its jurisdiction to entertain\n          an application for reference to arbitration as regards\n          the disputes arising therefrom and it has been the\n\f                          // 65 //\n\n         consistent view that in the event the claims arising\n         within the ambit of excepted matters, question of\n         assumption of jurisdiction of any arbitrator either with\n         or without the intervention of the court would not\n         arise; The parties themselves have decided to have the\n         same adjudicated by a particular officer in regard to\n         these matters: what are these exceptions however are\n         questions of fact and usually mentioned in the contract\n         documents and forms part of the agreement as such\n         there is no ambiguity in the matter of adjudication of\n         these specialised matters and termed in the agreement\n         as the excepted matters.”\n\n\n13.4 In that view of the matter, the High Court has misread\n    and misinterpreted the clauses 9.0.1.0 and 9.0.2.0 and\n    has seriously erred in holding that where there is\n    contestation or the decision rendered by the General\n    Manager leaves scope for argument as to whether the\n    claims alleged by the contractor can be categorized as\n    Notified Claim is best left to the Arbitral Tribunal. The\n    dispute whether the claim is a Notified Claim or not is\n    specifically excluded from the scope, purview and ambit\n    of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, once such a\n    dispute falls within the ‘excepted matters’, any decision\n    by the General Manager on the issue of Notified Claims\n    cannot be the subject matter of arbitration proceeding.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">13.5 Therefore, the High Court has erred in referring the\n    dispute to arbitration and appointing a sole Arbitrator to\n    adjudicate on the dispute with respect to the claims\n    which as such are held to be not Notified Claims by the\n    General    Manager.     Therefore,    the    Civil   Appeal\n\f                             // 66 //\n\n      No.342/2022 arising out of SLP (C) No.13408/2019 as\n      well as Civil Appeal Nos.343/2022 and 345/2022\n      arising out of SLP (C) Nos.13813/2019 and 13816/2019\n      respectively deserve to be allowed and the impugned\n      judgment and orders passed by the High Court in\n      respective arbitration petitions deserve to be quashed\n      and set aside.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">13.6 So far as the Civil Appeal No.344/2022 arising out of\n      SLP (C) No.13815/2019 arising out of the impugned\n      judgment and order passed by the High Court in\n      Arbitration Petition No.407/2018 is concerned, as the\n      General Manager himself has declared that only one\n      claim of the respondent was / is a Notified Claim, the\n      said appeal is to be allowed partly by observing that the\n      claim which is declared by the General Manager as a\n      Notified Claim only shall have to be referred to\n      arbitration and the learned Arbitrator shall have no\n      jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes with respect to\n      other claims which as such are not declared as Notified\n      Claims by the General Manager.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">14.
