This petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India\nis filed by the petitioner challenging the impugned award dated\n19.10.2016 passed by the Labour Court, Anand in Reference\n(Demand) No.1 of 2012 and further prayed to reject the reference\nof respondent No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">2.    Learned advocate Mr. Dipak Dave appearing for the\npetitioner submits that the present petitioner seeks to challenge\nabsolutely illegal and unjustified award dated 19.10.2016 passed\nby Labour Court, Anand in Reference (Demand) No. 1 of 2012,\nwhereby the Labour Court has been pleased to allow the\nreference of respondent no.1 and it has been declared that the\nworkmen concerned in the reference are held to be the regular\nworkmen of the petitioner from 16.11.2010 and further to pay\nregular wages and all other benefits alongwith difference amount\nto the said employees. It is submitted that despite the fact that\nrespondent No.1 is not the recognized union of the petitioner,\nchartere of demand came to be raised by respondent No.1 on\n16.11.2010. It is submitted that there are about 13000 number\nof employees working in the petitioner company and petitioner\ncompany is engaged in transmission of energy which is a public\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                               Page 1 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                    Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                        ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\nutility service. Thus, the very basis of raising industrial dispute\nagainst the petitioner rests on false and fraudulent ground.\nLearned advocate for the petitioner submitted that without\nproperly continuing the conciliation as also verification of\nmembers as also the fact that respondent No.1 is not having\nsufficient number of employees as its members, reference came\nto be made before the Labour Court, Anand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.1    It is submitted that in the year 2009 demand was made for\nthe purpose of getting provident fund from the concerned\ncontractor and the matter was settled between the contractor\nand the concerned employees, in which the petitioner was made\nintervener in the said settlement being the principal employer.\nThe settlement clearly accepts the fact that the concerned\nemployees are the employees of the contractor and they are to be\npaid provident fund dues by the contractor. Before the Labour\nCourt several other documents also came to be produced to\nshow that in fact the concerned employees are the employees of\nthe contractor. In fact the petitioner is a Government company\nwhere there is a procedure prescribed for recruitment of Class IV\nemployees/watchman, the concerned employees are held to be\nthe employees of the petitioner. The Labour Court vide impugned\naward dated 19.10.2016 held that the concerned employees are\nto be treated as regular employees of the petitioner w.e.f.\n16.11.2010 and they shall have to be paid wages, benefits and\nother allowances from the said date. Though reference case is of\nthe year 2012, right from the date of charter of demand and\nwithout holding any justification for back wages, the impugned\naward came to be passed. It is submitted that there was no\nsupervision and control over the concerned employees by the\npetitioner. The concerned employees were never appointed by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                             Page 2 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                                      ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\npetitioner. The work of the concerned employees cannot be said\nto be permanent or perennial in nature. Merely on the basis of\nsome answer given by the witness of the petitioner that work of\nsecurity is essential requirement, it cannot be held to be\nessential requirement work of the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.2    Learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that the\nLabour Court has failed to appreciate that it has no jurisdiction\nto receive, entertain and decide the reference. In fact the\nrespondent No.1 is not registered union with the petitioner. The\nreference raised by the respondent No.1 is therefore null and\nvoid. The respondent No.1 does not have sufficient employees as\nits members. Even as per the case of the respondent No.1 it is\nhaving only 10 employees as its members. Thus the respondent\nNo.1 does not have even 1% of membership of the total\nemployees of the petitioner which is 13000. The Labour Court\nhas exceeded its jurisdiction while holding that the contract is\nsham and bogus. The terms of reference as referred to the\nLabour Court contained the dispute as to whether the employees\nshown in schedule who are so-called employees of contractor to\nbe treated as permanent employees of the petitioner? Admittedly,\nthere is no reference as to whether the contract is to be declared\nas sham and bogus. In absence of any terms in reference as to\nwhether the contract is sham and bogus, Labour Court could not\nhave considered the said issue. It is submitted that in fact when\nthere was no challenge to the contract being sham and bogus\nand there being no terms of reference on the said aspect, Labour\nCourt, a court of limited jurisdiction, could not have travelled\nbeyond the scope of terms of reference. The Labour Court\ntransgressed its jurisdiction and stepped into the role of\nappropriate             Government    and           exercised     jurisdiction            of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     Page 3 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                                        ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\nappropriate Government while observing that the work of\nsecurity guard is essential work of the petitioner and the same\nhas to be done by the employees of the petitioner, thereby\nholding the concerned employees as regular employees of the\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">2.3    It is submitted that the Labour Court entirely overlooked\nthe documents produced on record in form of provident fund\nslip, attendance register, appointment orders of the concerned\nemployees. Though the provident fund slips are admitted by the\nemployees         and         admittedly   the        same   being        Government\ndocument, showing that the contractor was deducting provident\nfund of the concerned employees and depositing the same with\nthe provident fund department on its own provident fund\nnumber.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">2.4    It is submitted that the Labour Court has failed to\nappreciate that petitioner being Government company there is\nprocedure for the purpose of appointment of Class IV employees\nand/or watchman.

Therefore there is\ninconsistency between the versions of the contractor and the\npetitioner and the documents are not reliable documents. The\nLabour Court has also found that if the contract is genuine and\nthe contractor is engaged through process of tender the\npetitioner ought to have produced tender related papers. The\nLabour Court also found that the identity cards of the workmen\nshow names of different security contractors between the years\n1995-2008.

The    petitioner   acquiesced         in      the\nproceedings before the Labour Court and therefore, it cannot be\npermitted to challenge the order or reference after the award is\npassed. All 13 persons working as Security guards and Security\nSupervisor are members of the sponsoring union and the dispute\npertains to only these 13 workmen. The documents which are\nnot produced before the Labour Court cannot be produced before\nthis Court and cannot be looked into for the purpose of\nexamining the impugned award. The workmen has established\nthat they were continuing in service for last 15 to 18 years\nthough the contractors has changed. Thereafter, if it is the\nassertion of the petitioner that the contract labour system is\ngenuine and therefore, it was for the petitioner to prove that\nfacts by leading documentary and oral evidence. The burden of\nproof was on the petitioner to prove its case and it cannot be\nsaid that Labour Court has wrongly placed the burden of proof\non the petitioner as alleged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1750914\" id=\"span_25\">3.5    Learned advocate for the respondent has relied upon the\ndecision of the Apex Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1750914/\" id=\"a_13\">Indian Overseas Bank Vs.\nI.O.B.

This dispute is raised based on the\nprinciple <a href=\"/doc/233490/\" id=\"a_18\">laid down by</a> the Various High Courts and the Apex\nCourt.     The      petitioner-corporation        is   registered        under         the\n<a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_19\">Companies Act</a>-1956 and exclusively run by Government of\nGujarat. The said company is running without public fund and\nturn from the name of Gujarat Vidhut Board functioning\ngeneration of electricity and transit it. The dispute has raised by\nthe security workers of the unit situated at: Kasor, Ta. Sojitra.\nThe     workman         Mr.Chandrakantbhai             M.     Prajapati         is     the\nsupervisor and rest of the workmen are working as guard since\nthe time Mentioned in schedule annexed with Statement of\nClaim. It is submitted that by management, supervisor is paying\n3500/- per month while rest of the workmen are paying 2700/-\nper month and cost of uniform being deducted from Salary. It\nalso appears from the record that all the workmen were\nemployed by responsible officer of Gujarat Vidhut Board, who is\npetitioner-corporation and than they are treats as workmen of\nContractors as other private Companies appoint such workmen\nby contractors though said workmen are working same as\nregular and permanent workmen of management. It also appears\nfrom the record that management has created contract system\nonly on paper arrangement, sham and camouflage as workmen\nare doing work to supervise the building from theft and observe\ndiscipline which is in permanent nature. It also appears from the\nrecord that in fact employment work is doing by only principal\nmanagement and all the formalities like physical test, interview,\nselection procedure, medical test, distribution of work IT, were\nalso done by principal employer - petitioner corporation and\nselected workmen&#x27;s names shows in muster roll in which\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  Page 13 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                               Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n     C/SCA/6262/2017                          ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\nemployees are shown as workmen of contractor. In fact workmen\nare even not know who is current contractor and under whom\ncontractor they are working. The contractor and workmen are\nnot working under the direction of Contractor and they are\nobeying the order of officers of petitioner-corporation, if any\nworkman wants to leave, they have apply to petitioner-\ncorporation and contractor does not even comes to the workplace\nalso. During the service tenure, workmen have work under the\nfollowing contractors : (1) Gujarat Personal Security Service (2)\nJay Security Service (3) Express Security Service (4) Gujarat\nSecurity Service (5) National Security Service (6) Siddhi Security\nService (7) Reliable Investigation and Security Service (8) Alert\nAllied Security Service. These all are contractors are came and\ngone, but all the workmen have served in permanent nature and\nhaving intact service. Interestingly these all contractors have not\nselected them, not given any appointment letter or removal\norders and even workmen are not know who are running these\ncontracts and when contracts ended. It appears from the record\nthat even some times workmen have served between the time\nwhen one contract ends and another came into force. Whenever\npetitioner-corporation raised any complaint against some of the\nworkmen, he used only letter head of the such so called\ncontractor. In February 2004, contractor had decide to employ\nEx-army men and also employed such type of workmen, and\nthese workmen was decided to be removed from their service,\nbut these workmen probed by hunger strike and at that time, by\nmediation of local MLA, petitioner-corporation has withdrawn his\ndecision and workmen were remained in service by so called\nassign new Contract to the Siddhi Labour and Security Service\nand workmen were included in said contractor.

Yard\nand (4) 440 K.V. Yard in one security guard and one is their\nsecurity supervisor. General shift is Morning 10-00 o&#x27;clock to\nEvening 6-00 o&#x27;clock and duty of workmen does decide by an\nofficer of the petitioner-corporation. It appears from the record\nthat whoever enrolled as security guard with contractor are\ngetting wages as per contract including grade pay, increments,\ndearness allowance, leave with wages, other allowances, and\ndoing secure job while these workmen are doing} same job are\ngetting only Rs. 2700/- per month.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">6.    From the reply given by the petitioner-corporation before\nthe Labour Court, it appears that Gujarat government has\nallotted land at Kasor for built up 400 K.V.

The contractor whose tender was passed by petitioner-\ncorporation were employed the workmen, got licence from\nconcerned authority and also supervise themselves and wages\nwere also paid by that contractor. The petitioner-corporation has\ngiven contract to the Contractor-Alert Allied Service from\n01.01.2008 to 30.11.2010 and said contractor did not pay the\nsalary to his workmen. When contract has given to Contractor-\nAlert Allied Service, he has appointed the said workmen by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                            Page 15 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n      C/SCA/6262/2017                             ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\ngetting application from respective workmen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1776367\" id=\"span_44\">7.    With regard to issue of the respondent-union not being a\nregistered union and not having proper representation of the\nworkmen of the petitioner-corporation, it would be appropriate to\nrefer to a unreported decision of the Apex Court in case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1776367/\" id=\"a_20\">Newspapers, Limited, Allahabad Vs. State of Industrial\nTribunal, Uttar Pradesh &amp; Ors.</a> passed in Civil Appeal\nNo.348 of 1959 dated 04.05.1960, wherein while examining\nthe contention raised that the association which sponsored the\ncase of the workmen was a unregistered body and that made the\nreference invalid. The Apex Court held that it is not necessary\nthat a registered body should sponsor a workmen&#x27;s case to make\nit an industrial dispute. Once it is shown that a body of\nworkmen either acting through their union or otherwise                     had\nsponsored the workmen&#x27;s case, it becomes an industrial dispute.\nMoreover, from the record, it appears that the written reply filed\nby the petitioner-corporation did not raise this issue to challenge\nthe reference on the ground of the respondent-union not being\nregistered or not representing the majority of the workmen. It is\nevident from the affidavit-in-rejoinder filed on behalf of the\npetitioner-corporation (Page No.149 - Para 5) that for the first\ntime, the petitioner-corporation has challenged the locus of the\nrespondent-union.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366376\" id=\"span_45\">8.

This\n     conclusion has been arrived at in these decisions on the\n     interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 10</a> of the Act. However, it has to be\n     remembered that the authority to abolish the contract labour\n     under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 10</a> of the Act comes into play only where there\n     exists a genuine contract. In other words, if there is no genuine\n     contract and the so called contract is sham or a camouflage to\n     hide the reality, the said provisions are inapplicable. When, in\n     such circumstances, the concerned workmen raise an industrial\n     dispute for relief that they should be deemed to be the employees\n     of the principal employer, the Court or the industrial adjudicator\n     will have jurisdiction to entertain the dispute and grant the\n     necessary relief. In this connection, we may refer to the following\n     decision of this Court which were also relied upon by the counsel\n     for the workmen.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">     And ultimately concluded in Paragraph No.53 and relevant\nfor the purpose of this case being Paragraph No.53(ii), the said\nparagraph quoted herein below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     &quot;53 [ii] if the contract is sham or not genuine, the workmen of the\n     so called contractor can raise an industrial dispute for declaring\n     that they were always the employess of the principal employer\n     and for claiming the appropriate service conditions. When such\n     dispute is raised, it is not a dispute for abolition of the labour\n     contract and hence the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 10</a> of the Act will not\n     bar either the raising or the adjudication of the dispute. When\n     such dispute is raised, the industrial adjudicator has to decide\n     whether the contract is sham or genuine. It is only if the\n     adjudicator comes to the conclusion that the contract is sham,\n     that he will have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. If,\n     however, he comes to the conclusion that the contract is genuine,\n     he may refer the workmen to the appropriate Government for\n     abolition of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 10</a> of the Act and\n     keep the dispute pending.

I.O.B. Staff\nCanteen Workers&#x27; Union &amp; Anr.</a> reported in 2000 (4) SCC\n245, wherein in Paragraph No.8, the Apex Court while raising\nthe very question whether in view of categorical findings of fact\narrived at by the Tribunal, can a single judge while exercising\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, could\nhave reappreciate the evidence and come to a different\nconclusion. The said Paragraph No.8 reads as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       &quot;8.    The question is whether in view of such categorical\n       findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal, the learned Single\n       Judge      exercising   jurisdiction       under   <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article     226</a>      of    the\n       Constitution of India could re-appreciate the evidence and\n       come to a different conclusion. We have already pointed out\n       that the learned single Judge had erred in appreciating certain\n       documents and the evidence in the case. We are clearly of the\n       opinion that the learned Single Judge had no material to\n       characterise the judgment of the Tribunal as perverse. We will\n       once again refer to certain important matters which would go a\n       long way to decide the matter. The inference drawn from Ex.M1\n       that it was the Union, who wanted the canteen is far from\n       truth. The subsequent evidence has got to be looked into on\n       this aspect of the case. In Ex.M4, dated 23.4.1988, the Union\n       has informed the bank about the new canteen promoters for\n       the record of the bank. The inference drawn by the learned\n       Judge from Ex.M5 that the canteen was not exclusive for the\n       bank is based on a misconception. The evidence of MW1\n       clearly shows that the canteen is meant only for the bank. His\n       evidence is as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;... The canteen is meant only for the staff of the bank the\n       canteen will remain only for closed on bank holidays...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                  Page 19 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                             Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"169326923\" id=\"span_56\">C/SCA/6262/2017                                ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\n          The observation that the bank was running the canteen to\n   retain     good   relationship    between   the     union        and      the\n   management is not appropriate and on the other hand, it only\n   shows that the bank was implicitly bound to maintain the\n   canteen. The learned Single Judge has not given due weight to\n   the two principles enunciated in the <a href=\"/doc/169326923/\" id=\"a_36\">LIC</a> case and undisturbed\n   by the RBI case. We have already quoted those principles.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">   9. One other significant fact which has escaped the attention of\n   the learned Single Judge is the letter written by the Central\n   Office of the bank when the promoters expressed their inability\n   to run the canteen with effect from 26.4.90. Says the\n   management as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">          &#x27;Member of staff are advised that the canteen will function\n   in our canteen block with effect from 21.10.1992. The\n   contractors will run the canteen with minimum staff for a week\n   on a trial basis to overcome the difficulties if any. The canteen\n   will run normally after a week or so....&#x27;\n\n          The bank further says that the canteen is for the welfare\n   of the staff and directs as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">          &#x27;All members are requested to avail this facility and\n   refrain from going out for coffee and tea. Since the canteen has\n   started functioning the Department Heads should inform all\n   the staff members to restrict their lunch time to half an hour\n   between 12.30 and 3.00 p.m. and the staff may be permitted to\n   go for lunch in fixed time to avoid heavy rush at the canteen...&#x27;\n\n          The above passage quoted from the letter of the Central\n   Office of the Bank amply establishes that the bank had an\n   obligation to run the canteen and in fact, was running the\n   canteen, through contractors, even though the promoters had\n   withdrawn their services. Actually, it            appears that the\n   promoters were desirous of forming a co-operative society and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                             Page 20 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                                     Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                                        ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\n         it did not fructify. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169326923\" id=\"span_59\">In this view of the matter, it is clear that as\n         in the <a href=\"/doc/169326923/\" id=\"a_37\">LIC</a> case, the bank had been running the canteen by one\n         or other of the agency.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">11.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1613762\" id=\"span_60\">In yet another judgment, the Apex Court in case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1613762/\" id=\"a_38\">Harjinder Singh Vs.

In the opinion of the Court, the numbers of members will\nnot be a deciding factor to sponsor an industrial dispute on\nbehalf of the workmen. The case of the petitioner that the\nrespondent-union is an unregistered union and the industrial\ndispute is not maintainable at his behest ought to have taken at\nthe first point of time and as is held by the Apex Court in case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1613762/\" id=\"a_51\">Harjinder Singh</a> (supra), the Court is not inclined to examine the\nissue at a belated stage.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">13.    The petitioner had an occasion to raise such issue even at\nthe stage of reference being made by the Conciliation Officer. The\npetitioner not having challenge such reference at the relevant\ntime is deemed to have acquiesced. Moreover, thereafter, the\npetitioner has fully participated in the industrial dispute without\nraising such contention, and therefore, such contention, in the\nopinion of the Court, is an afterthought, which will not render\nthe order of the Labour Court vulnerable. Yet in another decision\nof the Apex Court in case of Workmen of Rohtak General\nTransport Company vs. Rohtak General Transport Company\npassed in Civil Appeal No.349 of 1961 dated 27.02.1962\nexplaining an industrial dispute what is dispute between some\nworkmen and their employer.

Similarly, when the issue\nwas not before the Labour Court, there was no scope for either\nside to establish this fact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">14.    The contention raised with regard to the Labour Court\nhaving exceeded its jurisdiction, cannot be accepted considering\nthe terms of reference itself, which categorically provided for that\nwhether a workman of contractor be treated as a permanent\nworkman of the petitioner-corporation and it is in this regard,\nthe evidence appears to have been led by both the sides, which\nconsisted of oral evidence of the workmen, representative of the\npetitioner-corporation, the documentary evidence with regard to\nthe attendance register etc., which would indicate the status of\nthe respondent-workman with the petitioner. The Labour Court\nhas correctly appreciated the evidence with regard to the\nconnection between the petitioner and the respondent-workmen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">15.    This Court has also even considering the additional\ndocuments, which are placed on record to convince this Court\nthat the contract was proper and legally acceptable still the\nCourt cannot come to such a conclusion, as the additional\ndocuments, which are produced along with the rejoinder\npertains to a single advertisement issuing tender for contract\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                               Page 25 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                  Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                           ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\nthat too for year 2002, but not pertaining to the period in\nquestion been examined by the Labour Court and some terms\nand conditions with regard to the tender contract.

Security Man not being in anyway connected to the\nobject of the petitioner-corporation, which is established for\npower generation. The workmen could not have been engaged\nthrough the contractor. In the opinion of the Court, the nature of\nwork, as is described in the preceding paragraphs, would clearly\nindicate that the respondent-workman were engaged for the\nmaintenance of the security of a Unit of the petitioner-\ncorporation though the same may not be directly connected with\nthe generation of electricity yet the work of security is closely\nconnected with the corporation as Security would also be a\npotential part to maintain transmission/generation of power,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                             Page 26 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                   Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                          ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\nwhich is a basic object of the petitioner-corporation. The Labour\nCourt has therefore applied the correct principle, as is laid down\nin the decision of <a href=\"/doc/1160961/\" id=\"a_52\">Steel Authority of India Ltd</a> (supra)              and by\napplying such principles and having examined the facts based\non evidence vide Exh.61, Exhs.38 to 41, Exh.25 &amp; Exh.36\narrived at a conclusion that the security work would essential,\nperennial and has been taken from the respondent-workmen for\nthe period 15 to 18 years.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">18.    The submission of learned advocate for the petitioner\nregarding overlooking certain documents which the petitioner in\nsupport of his contention has placed on record at Annexure-F\n(Colly) consisting of one P.F. Receipt, Identity Card, Register etc.\nto submit that the contractor was genuine and contractor was\nthe real employer. In the opinion of the Court, as is held in the\npreceding paragraphs, the Court is not satisfied with the\ndocuments, which were placed before the Labour Court as well\nas before this Court to conclude that the contract was a genuine\ncontract. In favour of the contractor, there was nothing on record\nthat while issuing the the contract in favour of the contractor viz.\nrespondent nos.2 &amp; 3 herein, the petitioner-corporation has\nfollowed      tender procedure   and     pursuant   to     such       tender\nprocedure, the contract has been allotted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">19.    Over and above, the oral evidence of the workmen had\nclearly indicated the nature of work, which was performed,\ninstructions being issued and the manner in which the salary\nhas been paid to the respondent-workmen. The same indicate\nthat the contract was shame and bogus and the Court does not\nsee any reason to interfere especially on the ground that the\ndocuments of the petitioner-corporation were not properly\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                             Page 27 of 29</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                    Downloaded on : Mon Jul 04 20:31:21 IST 2022</span>\n       C/SCA/6262/2017                           ORDER DATED: 28/06/2022\n\n\n\nappreciated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">20.
