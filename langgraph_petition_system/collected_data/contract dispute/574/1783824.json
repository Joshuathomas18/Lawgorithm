They submitted therefore that the award\n\n    ought to be set aside and that the matter be remanded to\n            \n\n\n    the   Industrial   Tribunal    for   a   fresh       hearing          and\n         \n\n\n\n    adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">    4.

About the title of the plaintiffs to\n            Items 46 to 51 in the schedule annexed to\n            the plaint, the High Court disagreed with\n            the trial court. These properties were\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n            purchased in the names of two of the three\n            plaintiffs by the sale deed Est.

We are not unmindful of the fact\n     that pleadings before such bodies have\n     not to be read strictly, but it is equally\n     true that the pleadings must be such as\n      \n\n\n     to give sufficient notice to the other party\n   \n\n\n\n     of the case it is called upon to meet.

The rules of fair\n\n\n\n\n\n     play demand that where a party seeks to\n     establish a contention which if proved\n     would be sufficient to deny relief to the\n     opposite side, such a contention has to be\n     specifically pleaded and then proved. But\n\n\n\n\n\n     if there is no pleading there is no\n     question of proving something which is\n     not pleaded.

According to him, if they\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    were convinced that they were regular workers of the\n\n    Petitioner, they ought not to have made an application to\n\n\n\n\n                                      \n    the Contract Labour Board, which was contrary to the\n                          \n    denial of their relationship as employees of the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">    22.        I find both the submissions to be not well\n                         \n    founded.    It is quite obvious that the application to the\n\n    Contract Labour Board was made out of abundant caution.\n</p>            \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">    The entire tenor of the Complaint dated 26.12.1985\n         \n\n\n\n    makes this clear. I have earlier referred to the averments\n\n    in the Complaint to the effect that according to the union\n\n\n\n\n\n    all the workmen are actually permanent and regular\n\n    employees of the Petitioner but that the Petitioner had\n\n\n\n\n\n    connived with the contractors to deprive the workmen of\n\n    the benefits of regular workmen. The very first sentence\n\n    of the Complaint also refers to the workmen as &quot;so called\n\n    contract workers&quot;.    It is further stated therein that the\n\n    management and the contractors would play a trick on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:38 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                23</span>\n\n    the workmen by pretending to terminate the&quot;so called&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                     \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">    contract between the company and the contractors.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n                                             \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">    These averments are far from admissions       by the Union\n\n    and the workers that the contracts were genuine. In fact,\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n    even the existence of the contracts has been denied in\n\n    the said Complaint.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n                                    \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">    23.     The doubt, if any, in this regard is removed by\n                          \n    the fact that the application to the Contract Labour Board\n\n    and the Complaint were filed contemporaneously.               This\n                         \n    itself establishes that there was no admission on the part\n\n    of the union or the workmen that the contracts between\n            \n\n\n    the contractors and the Petitioner were genuine.          Nor is\n         \n\n\n\n    there anything in law that prevented the union or the\n\n    workers from making the application as well as filing the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Complaint as was suggested by Mr. C.U. Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_61\">    24.     Mr.C.U. Singh submitted that the entire matter\n\n\n\n\n\n    must be considered as a whole and that I ought not to\n\n    consider the case of each contractor independently. Thus,\n\n    he submitted that an admission by a witness with respect\n\n    to a contract must be considered relevant to the other\n\n    contracts as well. For instance he    submitted that the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:38 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                 24</span>\n\n    evidence of one Janabai in the case of the gardening\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n    contract between Respondent no.8 and the Petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    contained an admission of the existence of the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_62\">    This admission, he submitted, should be used in all the\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    other cases as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">    25.      The approach does not commend itself to me.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                    \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_64\">    The Petitioner and each of Respondent nos. 3 to 9 allege\n                           \n    that there was a contract between them, pursuant to\n\n    which the said workers were deployed for carrying out the\n                          \n    Petitioner&#x27;s work, but as employees of the contractors. It\n\n    is not necessary that the conclusion in respect of one\n            \n\n\n    contract would apply to all the other contracts.               The\n         \n\n\n\n    decision in respect of each contract would depend upon\n\n    the merits thereof.    The alleged contracts         and        the\n\n\n\n\n\n    alleged contractors were different in each case.               The\n\n    workmen were different in each case. The evidence was\n\n\n\n\n\n    different in each case.    There is no reason why the\n\n    conclusion in respect of one contract ought to apply to the\n\n    other contracts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">    26.      The admission of one witness in respect of the\n\n    contract with which that witness was concerned, cannot\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:38 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                  25</span>\n\n    possibly be used to the detriment of the workmen under\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        \n    the other contracts. There is no justification for the same.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">    Nor do I see any logical basis to support this contention. It\n\n    could equally be argued then on the other hand, that if\n\n\n\n\n                                               \n    one contract is established to be sham and bogus, that\n\n    conclusion ought to follow in respect of the other\n\n\n\n\n                                     \n    contracts.   An admission or any other evidence which\n                          \n    militates against a genuine contract in one case, could\n\n    then, even in the absence of anything else, establish that\n                         \n    there was no genuine contract in other cases as well. I\n\n    cannot see any reason why, absent anything else, the\n            \n\n\n    evidence in respect of one contract should be treated as\n         \n\n\n\n    evidence in respect of another contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">    27.      It is possible that the workers or the union or the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Petitioner may have either inadvertently or otherwise not\n\n    adduced all the necessary and available evidence in\n\n\n\n\n\n    respect of one contract. It would be unfair then to visit\n\n    the   adverse effect thereof on workmen under               all the\n\n    other contracts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">    28.      It is true that the evidence of some of the\n\n    witnesses was not confined to merely one contract.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:38 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                    26</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">    Indeed, if any part of the evidence, oral or documentary,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    reflects upon more than one contract, it must be\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    considered while dealing with such other contracts.                  For\n\n    instance, it is possible that the evidence of one witness,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    even though led for one contract, may reflect upon\n\n    another    contract   or   contracts.   In   that   event,         such\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    evidence must be considered while deciding the nature of\n                           \n    the other contracts. That however would not support the\n\n    wider proposition that the conclusion regarding one\n                          \n    contract would apply to the other contracts. There can\n\n    always be a sham contract in respect of one contractor\n            \n\n\n    and a genuine contract in respect of another contractor.\n</p>         \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">    29.        Mr. Rele submitted that the case of the workmen\n\n    whose services were terminated by the alleged contractor\n\n\n\n\n\n    and are not in service today, cannot be decided.                    This\n\n    submission was especially in respect of certain security\n\n\n\n\n\n    guards who failed to obtain any interim reliefs as stated\n\n    earlier.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">    30.        The failure to obtain interim reliefs would not\n\n    prevent a party from obtaining reliefs at the final hearing\n\n    of the proceeding.

Their rights and\n\n    indeed the rights of any party are not determined on the\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    basis of decisions in the interlocutory proceedings. In\n\n    certain cases the final relief may be moulded keeping in\n\n\n\n\n                                     \n    mind the developments during the pendency of                     the\n                         \n    litigation but with that I am not concerned in this case. In\n\n    other words, merely because such security guards               may\n                        \n    have got themselves registered with the Board would not\n\n    affect their rights in the proceedings.   Having failed to\n            \n\n\n    obtain interim reliefs, it is but natural that they would\n         \n\n\n\n    seek employment elsewhere. That however would not\n\n    constitute an abandonment of their rights, if any.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">    31.

The\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n     industrial adjudicator has undoubtedly no\n     jurisdiction to abolish a genuine labour\n     contract in view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n     10</a> of the Act. However, it is not correct to\n\n\n\n\n                                      \n     say that the reference for the abolition of\n     the contract, itself stands barred. It is the\n     terms of the reference which will determine\n     the jurisdiction of the industrial adjudicator\n\n\n\n\n                             \n     to entertain and decide the reference. The\n     dispute as to whether the labour contract is\n                 \n     genuine or not can be agitated by the\n     workmen and the industrial adjudicator has\n     jurisdiction to examine the controversy. If\n                \n     the contract is held to be genuine, the\n     dispute, if it is espoused by the direct\n     workmen of the principal employer can be\n     kept pending by the industrial adjudicator\n     and the workmen may be referred by him to\n      \n\n\n     the appropriate Government             for the\n   \n\n\n\n     abolition of the contract. If the appropriate\n     Government abolishes the contract, the\n     industrial adjudicator can thereafter grant\n     further relief, if claimed, viz., of the\n\n\n\n\n\n     absorption of the workmen of the erstwhile\n     contractor in the principal establishment. If,\n     however, the appropriate Government does\n     not abolish the contract, the industrial\n     adjudicator may reject the reference, as\n\n\n\n\n\n     stated earlier. It is not, therefore, correct to\n     say that the reference of an industrial\n     dispute seeking to abolish the contract is\n     per se barred, as contended by the learned\n     counsel.

The Court also held that\n            the only question for decision was\n            whether the work which was perennial\n            and must go on from day to day and\n          \n\n\n            which was incidental and necessary for\n       \n\n\n\n            the work of the refinery and was sufficient\n            to employ a considerable number of\n            whole-time workmen and which was being\n            done in most concerns through direct\n\n\n\n\n\n            workmen, should be allowed to be done\n            by contractors. Considering the nature of\n            the work done and the        conditions of\n            service in the case, the Court opined that\n            the Tribunal&#x27;s decision was right and no\n\n\n\n\n\n            interference was called for.&quot; (emphasis\n            supplied)\n\n            The observations clearly     indicate that even\n\n    where a contract is of a perennial nature there can be a\n\n    genuine agreement for contract labour.

They have been\n\n    working between two and seven years prior to the\n                          \n    contract relied upon by the Petitioner.

The case of the union and the workers is that\n\n\n\n\n\n    these workers were from inception employed by the\n\n    Petitioner directly.   The Petitioner would obviously have\n\n    knowledge of and be in possession of the particulars and\n\n    the record pertaining to their employment prior to the\n\n    date of the alleged contract.

It is also important to note that the contractor\n\n    and the said foremen and manager had not been\n\n\n\n\n\n    examined     in     the   complaint.   The    Petitioner          and\n\n    Respondent no.3 had yet another opportunity to lead\n\n    evidence in the reference when the matter was remanded\n\n    by the Division Bench.

Godbole on\n\n    the other hand, contended that the wages were paid by\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    Elavia. The mere proof of the physical act of payment of\n\n    wages in a case such as this, by the principal employer or\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    the contractor, would not been conclusive of the issue. It\n                         \n    would always be possible to structure the payments\n\n    contrary to the real agreement.\n</p>                        \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">    78.     Mr.Rele relied upon two factors which he stated\n\n    were important. Firstly, he submitted that the payments\n            \n\n\n    had been made by the Petitioner as evidenced by the\n         \n\n\n\n    wage register. The pay register was for the period 1985.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">    It does not appear to have been marked in evidence. I will\n\n\n\n\n\n    however presume that the register was maintained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">    79.     However, the register     has been signed only by\n\n\n\n\n\n    the Petitioner&#x27;s representatives.   It has not even been\n\n    signed by the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_171\">            Under Rule 59 of the Maharashtra Contract\n\n    Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Rules, 1971, the muster\n\n    roll and register of wages are required to be maintained\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:39 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                            65</span>\n\n    by the Petitioner.

Further, one Rahalkar filed an affidavit dated\n          \n\n\n\n    7.2.1986 on behalf of the Petitioner in the complaint. The\n\n    affidavit was filed in an application filed by the union\n\n\n\n\n\n    before the Industrial Court for inspection. This application\n\n    for inspection, in turn, was occasioned by reason of a\n\n\n\n\n\n    letter dated 25.1.1986 addressed by the union to the\n\n    company, stating that one Philip J. Almeda had filed an\n\n    application    in the Industrial     Court    stating      that      the\n\n    workmen       in   the   complaint   were    not   employed            by\n\n    Respondent no.4 and therefore requested the company to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:40 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                                 70</span>\n\n    furnish details as to who had actually engaged the said\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n    eleven workmen.

What is important to note however is that after\n\n    all this, the said Rahalkar, in his affidavit dated 7.2.1986\n\n\n\n\n                                     \n    not only did not clarify the position as to who the\n                           \n    contractor was, but, in fact, proceeded on the basis that\n\n    Respondent no.4 was the contractor who had employed\n                          \n    them. In fact the affidavit and, in particular, paragraphs 7\n\n    and 11 thereof, proceed on the basis and, in any event,\n              \n\n\n    gives the impression    that it was Respondent no.4 who\n           \n\n\n\n    had employed them.      Nowhere in this affidavit does he\n\n    state that it was actually someone else who had engaged\n\n\n\n\n\n    these eleven workers mentioned in the complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_194\">    (d).     Further still, the case put to the union         witness\n\n\n\n\n\n    one Narayan Rane, in cross-examination, was that the\n\n    said workmen were working under Respondent no.4 and\n\n    that their wages were paid by him only.

Respondent no.4, he stated, had been granted\n\n\n\n\n\n    an engineering contract by the Petitioner, which involved\n\n    the work of repairing and fitting pipelines, fabrication of\n\n    plants etc., since 1981. He stated that for this contract\n\n    Respondent no.4 had engaged about three to four workers\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:40 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                         72</span>\n\n    who were paid their wages by Respondent no.4 and they\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    had nothing to do with the Petitioner.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                        \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">    (ii).       What is important to note is that he did not in his\n\n    examination-in-chief, clarify anything further regarding\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    the      identity    of   the    contractor   who     had       allegedly\n\n    engaged/employed the said eleven workers.

In his cross-examination,             Dennis Mendonca\n                                \n    stated that he also worked as a supervisor with his father-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_201\">    in-law     one      Domnic      Misquita,   who   was      the       labour\n               \n\n\n    contractor for agriculture with the Petitioner. The case of\n            \n\n\n\n    the Petitioner and Respondent no.4 now, therefore,\n\n    appears to be that Respondent no.4 A.J.

It indicates that there was no\n\n\n\n\n                                     \n    genuine contract of employment between any contractor,\n                            \n    Respondent no.4 or Domnic Misquita, and the concerned\n\n    workmen.    If indeed, the concerned workmen had been\n                           \n    engaged by any contractor and there was a genuine\n\n    contract between the Petitioner and the said contractor,\n          \n\n\n    the same would have been clear in the records of the\n       \n\n\n\n    Petitioner and would have been disclosed. The confusion\n\n    only indicates   that   there was no genuine             contract\n\n\n\n\n\n    between the Petitioner and any contractor for having the\n\n    work done through the said workmen and it is for this\n\n\n\n\n\n    reason that the same was not clarified. That the work was\n\n    done for the Petitioner by the said workmen is not denied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">    This therefore is a strong indication that the said eleven\n\n    workers were employed by the Petitioner directly and not\n\n    by any contractor.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:40 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                  74</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">    88.

What is even more important is that in his\n         \n\n\n\n    cross-examination, he states that he is unable to even\n\n    recognise or describe Respondent no.4 or the said\n\n\n\n\n\n    Misquita.

In his re-joinder before me, Mr.Rele did not meet\n                           \n    any of these arguments advanced by Mr. Singhvi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_225\">    96.       In the result, while it is clearly established that\n            \n\n\n    the work had been done by the said workers, for the\n         \n\n\n\n    Petitioner, there is not even an iota of evidence as to who\n\n    the alleged contractor was, and the details of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    relationship between the Petitioner and such alleged\n\n    contractor. Further all the factors relevant to a contract of\n\n\n\n\n\n    service which have been disclosed are shown to exist\n\n    between the workers and the Petitioner and not between\n\n    the workers and the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">    97.       In the facts of this case, the reference to the\n\n    workers as &quot;casual workers&quot; in Exhibit &quot;A&quot; to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:40 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                  80</span>\n\n    complaint, is of little importance. No case to this effect\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        \n    had been put to any of the union witnesses.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_227\">             According to them, as pointed out by Mr.Singhvi,\n\n    this was merely a nomenclature borrowed from the\n\n\n\n\n                                               \n    Petitioner. In a memorandum dated 10.6.1981, addressed\n\n    by one G. Srinivasan, these workers were referred to as\n\n\n\n\n                                      \n    &quot;casual labourer&quot;.   Moreover, the application for abolition\n                          \n    of contract labour dated 26.12.1985 and the complaint\n\n    itself, clearly indicate that the mere reference to the\n                         \n    workers as casual workers, was not an admission. In any\n\n    event, the question presently under consideration is\n            \n\n\n    whether these workers were directly engaged by the\n         \n\n\n\n    Petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">    98.      The union and the workmen have therefore\n\n\n\n\n\n    clearly discharged the burden. The burden shifted upon\n\n    the Petitioner which it failed to discharge.      The petition\n\n\n\n\n\n    therefore fails with regard to this contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">             RESPONDENT NO.5 - NEETA CATERERS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">    99.

It is not necessary for me to decide this question\n\n    in this case.

It is important to note certain aspects of his\n\n    evidence.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_319\">             Firstly, he does not give any details as to what\n\n    the lump sum payment was. He does not state how the\n\n    contracts were entered into. For instance, if the contracts\n\n    were entered into only orally, he does not furnish even\n\n    the names of the persons who entered into the same. He\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:42 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                   105</span>\n\n    does not give the details of the contracts regarding the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    provision of stalls, equipments etc.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_320\">    143.

Thirdly, this witness joined the Petitioner in\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    November, 1976. Between November, 1976 and January,\n                            \n    1991 he was a stenographer. Between January, 1991 and\n\n    prior to January 2000 he was the private secretary to a\n                           \n    Director of the Petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_322\">    145.     Though    he   denied      the   suggestion       that       his\n             \n\n\n    testimony is based on knowledge acquired from January,\n          \n\n\n\n    2000, it is important to note that he subsequently\n\n    admitted that upto January, 2000 he was not directly\n\n\n\n\n\n    authorised to deal with the subject matter of this dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_323\">    He volunteered that he had &quot;some interaction with the\n\n\n\n\n\n    concerned .........of this dispute&quot;. He further volunteered\n\n    that he had such interaction from January, 1991 and prior\n\n    to that also he had occasion to know of the activities of\n\n    the service provider.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_324\">             There is however nothing whatsoever on record\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:42 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                    106</span>\n\n    which even remotely suggests how as a stenographer and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    as a private secretary he was concerned with the said\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    contracts or derived knowledge of the details thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_325\">    146.      His further cross-examination establishes that he\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    had no personal knowledge.           He did not appear to be\n\n    familiar with the actual working of the said contract. In\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    respect of Respondent no.7, it is pertinent to note that he\n                           \n    did not even know the signature of the proprietor.                     He\n\n    admitted that when the alleged contract with Respondent\n                          \n    no.7 for the year 1983 was executed, he had no personal\n\n    or direct knowledge about the same. He admitted that he\n             \n\n\n    had not even seen the proprietor, with respect to\n          \n\n\n\n    Respondent no.7. He admitted that he had no knowledge\n\n    whether the workers listed in the annexure to the\n\n\n\n\n\n    agreement were not concerned with the reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_326\">    147.      He was cross-examined about the signatures on\n\n\n\n\n\n    the    alleged   agreements.         Apart   from    denying          the\n\n    suggestion, there is nothing in his evidence which\n\n    establishes the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_327\">    148.      From the evidence thus far, the balance of\n\n    probability indicates that the supervision was by the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:42 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_223\">                                      107</span>\n\n    company and not by the contractor.               The proprietor of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    Respondent no.5 did not examine himself.                      There is\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    nothing to indicate that he was unable to do so. This is\n\n    despite the fact that he was in the USA. It is not the case\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    of Respondent no.5 that an application to accommodate\n\n    him in any manner, was made, but was rejected by the\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n    Industrial Court or by the Industrial Tribunal. The alleged\n                             \n    &quot;supervisors&quot; were not examined.             I have already held\n\n    that the evidence by Bhujal Bhandari indicates the\n                            \n    absence of any control over the workers who even slept in\n\n    the Petitioner&#x27;s premises.       These facts when considered\n             \n\n\n    alongwith the finding of the wages being paid only by the\n          \n\n\n\n    Petitioner,     assume    greater       significance     than        when\n\n    considered by themselves.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_328\">    149.       I will ignore for the moment Mr.Singhvi&#x27;s reliance\n\n    upon the fact that all the material for running the canteen\n\n\n\n\n\n    was supplied by the Petitioner, as a fact by itself in\n\n    support of the contention raised by the union and the\n\n    workers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_329\">    150.       If   the   contract   with    Geeta    Caterers          which\n\n    preceded the alleged contract with Respondent no.5 is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:42 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                                       108</span>\n\n    proved to be genuine, I would ignore any lack of formal\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   \n    documentation or evidence in respect of the contract\n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n    between the Petitioner and Respondent no.5.                       Further, I\n\n    do not find any substance in Mr. Singhvi&#x27;s contention\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n    based on the mere fact that the same workers engaged\n\n    by Geeta Caterers were continued by Respondent no.5.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                              \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_330\">              This may     have been important had there been\n                             \n    no connection between Geeta Caterers and Respondent\n\n    no.5.

This is clear from his own evidence.\n</p>          \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_382\">             Firstly, it is important to note that he was not the\n\n    contractor at the relevant time.      In his examination-in-\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_383\">    chief in the complaint and in the reference, he admitted\n\n    that he is the son-in-law of one E.

He stated\n\n\n\n\n\n    that he was the proprietor of Respondent no.7 since the\n\n    year 2000 and that prior thereto his father-in-law E.\n\n    Alexender    was   the   proprietor   of   Respondent           no.7.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_384\">    Between the period 1986 and till he took over as the\n\n    proprietor, he stated that he was the manager of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:43 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">                                     124</span>\n\n    Respondent no.7.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_385\">    179.     Thus, prior to 1986 this witness had nothing to do\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    with Respondent no.7. It is the period prior to 1986 which\n\n    is most important.    A substantial part of his evidence in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n    the complaint, pertained to the manner in which he was\n\n    conducting the business. That part of the evidence is of\n\n\n\n\n                                         \n    little relevance or value as it admittedly pertained to the\n\n    period after the disputes.\n</p>                              \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_386\">    180.     He alleges that he pays the charges for washing\n                             \n    the uniforms. But, in his cross-examination, he stated that\n\n    he has no knowledge that the uniforms of his alleged\n             \n\n\n    workers were sent for washing alongwith the uniforms of\n          \n\n\n\n    other workers of the Petitioner. Although, under clause 7\n\n    of the alleged contract the contractor has to supply the\n\n\n\n\n\n    material, he admits in his cross-examination that the\n\n    material for carrying out the work is supplied by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Petitioner   and   that   the   same   is   evidenced         in    the\n\n    Petitioner&#x27;s registers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_387\">    181.

He did not furnish\n                           \n    any details regarding the period prior to 1986.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_389\">    182.    He alleged that Respondent no.7 had been doing\n                          \n    the work of house-keeping since September, 1983.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_390\">            He referred to the alleged agreement dated\n             \n\n\n    1.9.1983 and stated that the contract was renewed every\n          \n\n\n\n    year.   It is pertinent to note however that in cross-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_391\">    examination he admitted that prior to 1986 he was in\n\n\n\n\n\n    service in one of the Gulf countries. He thus             has no\n\n    knowledge of these facts and his evidence in this regard\n\n\n\n\n\n    must be regarded as purely hear-say.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_392\">    183.    In his cross-examination, in the reference, he\n\n    admitted that he was not even aware whether contracts\n\n    had been awarded by the Petitioner to Respondent no.7\n\n    from 1983 till date.   He volunteered that from 1983 to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_261\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:43 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_262\">                                   126</span>\n\n    2000 he was not the proprietor of Respondent no.7.

In the reference, he could not have been\n                           \n    examined as he had, by then, expired.               There is no\n\n    explanation however as to why Alexender was not\n                          \n    examined in the complaint. He was an important witness\n\n    for this contract.\n</p>             \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_395\">    184.       His evidence in the reference, pertains to the\n          \n\n\n\n    period after he allegedly took over as the proprietor of\n\n    Respondent no.7.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_396\">    185.       What is also important to note is that he does not\n\n    give any evidence of the terms and conditions on which\n\n\n\n\n\n    the workers were engaged prior to the date of the alleged\n\n    contract    entered   into   between   his    father-in-law            E.\n\n    Alexender and the Petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_397\">    186(i).

This supports the case\n                          \n    of the union that Ganapati, the alleged supervisor, was\n\n    also one of the workers.     He is not impleaded in the\n                         \n    complaint because thereafter he was also admittedly\n\n    employed directly by the Petitioner.\n</p>               \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_399\">    (iii).

The company       examined      Elavia    and one G.\n                          \n    Balasubramanium.       Elavia stated that the said workers\n\n    were the employees of Respondent no.7; referred to an\n             \n\n\n    agreement dated 1.9.1986 i.e. after the disputes between\n          \n\n\n\n    the Petitioner and Respondent no.7; referred to a letter\n\n    dated 3.3.1986 from the Petitioner to Respondent no.7\n\n\n\n\n\n    revising the compensation,           which   is also after the\n\n    disputes and denied that he had threatened to discharge\n\n\n\n\n\n    Dhotre if he continued with the union activities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_405\">             Elavia also denied that the company granted\n\n    leave to the said workers or recorded their attendance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_406\">    He stated that the wages were paid by the contractor.

His cross-examination on the other\n\n    hand, supports the case of the union.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                       \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_408\">    189.     Elavia alleged that material had been supplied by\n                          \n    Respondent no.7 to the workers.      This, however, as we\n\n    have seen earlier, is incorrect. The contractor&#x27;s witness\n                         \n    Martin admitted to the contrary.        He was not cross-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_409\">    examined on behalf of the Petitioner in this regard.\n</p>             \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_410\">    190.     He admitted the execution of various documents\n          \n\n\n\n    which as in the case of other contractors, would indicate\n\n    that it is the officers of the Petitioner who supervised the\n\n\n\n\n\n    work of the said workers, doing the work of house-keeping\n\n    as well. These are documents addressed by officers of\n\n\n\n\n\n    the Petitioner to the other departments of the Petitioner,\n\n    naming the persons who had been directed to supervise\n\n    the work of the said workers. I have already dealt with\n\n    and    rejected   Mr.Rele&#x27;s   submission   that      the      word\n\n    &quot;supervised&quot; in these documents must be read only to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_269\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:43 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_270\">                                    130</span>\n\n    mean that the Petitioner&#x27;s officers would remain present.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_411\">    191.

The evidence of this\n                         \n    witness is of no value to the Petitioner in respect of the\n\n    concerned contractors viz.

The complaint proceeded on the basis that\n\n    Respondent no.8, Nana D.

These seven workers were\n\n\n\n\n\n    employed      in   the   year   1967,    10.8.1976,     15.2.1978,\n\n    22.6.1981, 25.1.1982, 16.8.1984 and 14.5.1985.                 One of\n\n\n\n\n\n    them Janabai was examined by the union.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_417\">    196.    The Petitioner is totally confused about the entire\n\n    arrangement regarding the gardening contract.                 I would\n\n    preface a consideration of the facts with the comment\n\n    that the same strongly not only militates against the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:43 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">                                    132</span>\n\n    existence of a genuine contract, but in fact, supports the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    case of the union and the workers that the contract, if\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    any, between any contractor and the Petitioner, was a\n\n    mere camouflage. As I will demonstrate, there is, for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    better part of the material period, not even a paper\n\n    arrangement.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                         \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_418\">    197.       While considering this contract, it would be\n                            \n    convenient to first refer to the evidence of the Petitioner&#x27;s\n\n    witness and the evidence of Respondent no.8, who\n                           \n    examined himself. The evidence of these two witnesses is\n\n    wholly inconsistent, adding to the confusion. I will, as in\n             \n\n\n    the case of respondent no.4, presume that this confusion\n          \n\n\n\n    was not created deliberately and that the Petitioner itself\n\n    was not aware of the correct position. This fact however\n\n\n\n\n\n    itself   militates   against   the   existence     of a        genuine\n\n    contract.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_419\">    198.

He does\n          \n\n\n\n    not in his evidence even remotely suggests that during\n\n    this entire period from 1976 onwards there was any other\n\n\n\n\n\n    contractor in the place of Vijay D.

This part of the examination-in-chief does not\n                        \n    form even a part of the written statement filed by the\n\n    Petitioner. The written statement in this case, as in the\n             \n\n\n    case of Respondent no.4, proceeded on the basis that\n          \n\n\n\n    Respondent no.8 was the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_426\">            In his said affidavit, Rahalkar also did not state\n\n\n\n\n\n    what is sated in the examination-in-chief of Respondent\n\n    no.8.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_427\">            The wife of Vijay D.

The copy of the contract relied upon by the\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    Petitioner of 12.8.1976 was not even signed by Vijay D.\n\n    Thakre.

Though he is stated to\n                          \n    have left the company in the year 1980, there is nothing\n\n    to indicate that he was not available to give evidence in\n                         \n    the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_429\">    203.      Surely, if there were genuine contracts between\n             \n\n\n    the Petitioner on the one hand and the said Vijay Thakre,\n          \n\n\n\n    the widow of Vijay D.

The absence of the same\n\n    indicates, at the very least, that even assuming that there\n\n\n\n\n\n    was any intermediary contract or intermediary contractor,\n\n    the same was merely an arrangement to detract from the\n\n    fact that the said workers were actually directly employed\n\n    by the Petitioner. As it is, atleast on the basis of the\n\n    record, the Petitioner was not even aware of the identity\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:43 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">                                 136</span>\n\n    of the contractor it was dealing with.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_430\">    204.

The contract was allegedly entered into\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n    between the Petitioner and M/s. Vijay D. Thakre &amp; Co.

In the facts of this case, the failure to examine\n\n    Bhaskar B. Thakre is of crucial importance.           This entire\n             \n\n\n    case of the contract having been taken over first by the\n          \n\n\n\n    widow of Vijay D.

It was not even deposed to by the Plaintiff&#x27;s\n\n    witnesses Elavia and G. Balasubramanium.             In fact, the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Petitioner&#x27;s witness G.

There is no explanation from the\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    Petitioner as to on what basis the workers had been\n                           \n    employed by the Petitioner.

The muster-roll pertains to be of\n\n    January, 1985. In fact, the entries therein were clearly not\n                          \n    made during that period but subsequently. Normally, the\n\n    amounts paid would be entered under the column &quot;Net\n             \n\n\n    wages paid&quot;. However, in this document, the amounts\n          \n\n\n\n    entered are the sum of the amounts under two other\n\n    columns &quot;Leave with wages&quot; and &quot;Date of payment of\n\n\n\n\n\n    wages&quot;.      The column &quot;Leave with wages&quot; is further\n\n    divided   into   two   columns    viz.   &quot;Previous        Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n    Accumulated&quot; and &quot;further enjoyed and/or refused&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_483\">              It appears that the reason why these columns\n\n    were used is that the minimum wages were not being\n\n    paid. The Government Labour Officer and M.N. Inspector,\n\n    by a letter dated 14.1.1986 addressed to the contractor,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">                                     149</span>\n\n    stated so and called upon the contractor to pay the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    difference in arrears of wages.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                   \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_484\">               Thus, under the column &quot;Leave with wages&quot;, in\n\n    pencil, is the word &quot;difference&quot;.

The union examined one Harikant J.

He stated that\n\n    Elavia and Phartare, the employees of the Petitioner\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">                                    151</span>\n\n    supervised their work, paid their wages, granted them\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              \n    leave   and    supplied    articles   such   as     torches,         cells,\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    umbrellas and gumboots.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_494\">    240.

This part of the\n\n    evidence,     which   is   obviously    important,          is     totally\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    unsubstantiated and if, I may add, unreliable, as far as\n                              \n    Elavia is concerned. The deposition is merely to support\n\n    the case of these workers.             There is nothing that\n                             \n    establishes that Elavia had any training in fire fighting\n\n    himself.     No details of the alleged training have been\n             \n\n\n    furnished.     If the allegation was correct, it was an\n          \n\n\n\n    important factor in favour of the workers.

He also stated that the officers of the Petitioner\n\n    threatened the workers to resign from the union failing\n\n\n\n\n\n    which they would be discharged from their work. In his\n\n    examination-in-chief, the witness refers to the amounts\n\n    received by the workers before and after the formation of\n\n    the union and to the employment by the Petitioner of\n\n    security guards at other locations.

He however\n             \n\n\n    denied the suggestion that Pathare was from Respondent\n          \n\n\n\n    no.6 and was being paid by Respondent no.6.                    He also\n\n    denied that they received their wages from Pathare.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_502\">    248.      Considering the facts of this case, I am inclined to\n\n    place   considerable     reliance       upon   the   admission            in\n\n\n\n\n\n    paragraph 3(m) of the complaint filed by the union: &quot;The\n\n    supervisor of Respondent No.4 (i.e. Respondent no.6 in\n\n    this petition) Mr.Padtare..........&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_503\">    249.      Thus, it is admitted by the union that Pathare\n\n    was their supervisor.        That he was the supervisor is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">                                154</span>\n\n    admitted even in cross-examination.     The witness only\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n    denied that Pathare was an employee of Respondent no.6.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                 \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_504\">    The union however produced no evidence to establish that\n\n    Pathare was the employee of the Petitioner.             Thus, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n    union and the workers have failed to establish that the\n\n    supervision over them was by the Petitioner. In fact, the\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n    evidence indicates quite clearly that they were supervised\n\n    by Respondent no.6.\n</p>                          \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_505\">    250.    The witness was cross-examined regarding the\n                         \n    supply of articles for their work. He denied that the same\n\n    had been provided by Respondent no.6 and maintained,\n             \n\n\n    that they were provided by the Petitioner.\n</p>          \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_506\">    251.    Elavia, in his examination-in-chief, stated that\n\n    Respondent no.6 had been rendering security service to\n\n\n\n\n\n    the Petitioner for more than twenty years. He stated that\n\n    since 6.7.1986 their services had been terminated.                  He\n\n\n\n\n\n    stated that the fifteen employees mentioned in Exhibit\n\n    &quot;A&quot;, were not employed by the Petitioner but were\n\n    employed by Respondent no.6.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_507\">            He produced a copy of an agreement dated\n\n    15.10.1971 between the Petitioner and Respondent no.6\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">                                      155</span>\n\n    as well as the letter of termination dated 4.7.1986.

After\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n    6.7.1986      the   Petitioner   engaged   another      contractor\n\n    M/s.Security and Personal Services Pvt. Ltd.            He stated\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    that the said workers were not supervised by the\n\n    Petitioner.\n</p>                             \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_508\">    252.       As regards supervision, I have already observed\n                            \n    that the evidence produced by the union itself, cannot be\n\n    accepted. I am inclined to accept Elavia&#x27;s evidence that\n             \n\n\n    there was one security officer and three assistant security\n          \n\n\n\n    officers for supervising the work of the security guards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_509\">    The said security officers and assistant security officers\n\n\n\n\n\n    were employed by Respondent no.6.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_510\">    253.       It is important to note in this regard that even the\n\n\n\n\n\n    union witness viz. Mishra, in his cross-examination,\n\n    agreed that there were one security officer and three\n\n    assistant security officers and that in each shift there was\n\n    one assistant security officer who used to attend and that\n\n    the security officer was in overall charge of supervision.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">                                   156</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_511\">              Thus, Elavia&#x27;s evidence in this regard must be\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    accepted. What is important is that there is nothing which\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    indicates that either the security officer or the assistant\n\n    security officers had been engaged by the Petitioner. The\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    union had not even called for any documents which would\n\n    indicate the same.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                         \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_512\">    254.      Reverting to the agreement dated 15.1.1971, it\n                              \n    must be stated that the same on a plain reading, does not\n\n    indicate anything unusual.       It does not contain anything\n                             \n    which would indicate that it is sham or bogus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_513\">    255.      Indeed, Mr.Singhvi admitted that the agreement\n             \n\n\n    may well have started out as a genuine contract between\n          \n\n\n\n    the    Petitioner   and   Respondent        no.6.        He      however\n\n    suggested that in the course of time the workers became\n\n\n\n\n\n    the employees of the Petitioner.            He based this on the\n\n    fact that after this agreement no other agreement had\n\n\n\n\n\n    been produced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_514\">    256.      I am not inclined to agree. There is nothing on\n\n    record which indicates that the workers who were initially\n\n    appointed     under   a    genuine    contract         between            the\n\n    Petitioner   and    Respondent      no.6,    were        subsequently\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_324\">                                       157</span>\n\n    employed by the Petitioner. No particulars in this regard\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n    were furnished.        I am not inclined to accept the case of\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n    the union merely on surmise and conjuncture.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_515\">    257.     The        letter   terminating     the     agreement            with\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    Respondent no.6 states that the letter dated 15.1.1971\n\n    had been renewed from time to time. There is no reason\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    to disbelieve the same. In these circumstances, the fact\n                                 \n    that Respondent no.6 did not give any evidence cannot be\n\n    held against the Petitioner.\n</p>                                \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_516\">    258.     That the contract was renewed from time to time\n\n    and was terminated is established by another fact.\n</p>             \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_517\">             The Petitioner produced documents including the\n          \n\n\n\n    certificate    of     registration      inter-alia   in     respect           of\n\n    Respondent no.6. For instance, a certificate of registration\n\n\n\n\n\n    dated 11.8.1975 was renewed even in 1983 inter-alia in\n\n    respect of Respondent no.6. This itself supports strongly\n\n\n\n\n\n    the Petitioner&#x27;s case that the contract dated 15.10.1971\n\n    was renewed from time to time.                       The registration\n\n    certificate dated 3.12.1986 on the other hand, does not\n\n    contain the name of Respondent no.6.                           Thus, the\n\n    continuity and termination in respect of the contract is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:40:44 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">                                158</span>\n\n    clearly established.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_518\">    259.
