Admittedly, the reject coal was the\n\nproperty of first respondent and the appellant had sold\n\nback at Rs.900/- per metric ton. Therefore, the first\n\nrespondent rightly adjusted that in the running account\n\nbill of the appellant;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">      (vii) It was the appellant who did not co-operate\n\nfor joint reconciliation despite several written requests\n\nand demands of the first respondent.

The said act was not unilateral;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      (ix)   The judgments cited by the learned Counsel\n\nfor the appellant were not applicable and the trial Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                             MFA No.2825/2018</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                             14</span>\n\n\n\non weighing the material on record and the law on the\n\npoint has rightly rejected the applications and there are\n\nno grounds to interfere in such discretionary order.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">      19.

In the light of the rival contentions, this\n\nCourt has to examine the sustainability of the impugned\n\norder.

To claim temporary injunction under Order\n\nXXXIX Rule 1 and 2 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_23\">of CPC</a>, the applicant has to\n\nestablish the following three essential factors:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      (i)   Prima-facie case of right of the applicant\n\nand injury to such right;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                        MFA No.2825/2018</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                    16</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">        (ii)         Balance of convenience lies in favour of the\n\napplicant; &amp;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">        (iii)        If temporary injunction       is not granted,\n\napplicant will be put to irreparable injury.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">Reg.

Appellant    admits      execution       of    the\n\nagreement dated 14.10.2015 between itself and the\n\nfirst respondent for beneficiation of the coal. Except for\n\nthe interpretation of the term reserve price of the reject\n\ncoal, the appellant admits all other terms of the\n\ncontract. This Court has already narrated above what\n\nwere the terms of the contract and the repetition of the\n\nsame again in this context is not required.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_55\">        23.          At the instance of the appellant, respondent\n\nNo.2 had issued five bank guarantees in question in\n\nfavour of respondent No.1 as the guarantor/obligator.\n\nOut of the five bank guarantees, the bank guarantee for\n\na   sum         of    Rs.4.06    crores    was   for    security   cum\n\nperformance             bank     guarantee.      Other     four    bank\n\nguarantees were furnished towards the cost of raw\n\ncoal.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                            MFA No.2825/2018</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                             17</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">       24.   The first and foremost contention of the\n\nappellant&#x27;s Counsel is that since the bank guarantees\n\nwere co-related to the underlying contract between the\n\nappellant and the first respondent, unless the dispute\n\nbetween the parties regarding the breach of the terms\n\nof the underlying contract was adjudicated, respondent\n\nNo.1 cannot seek invocation of the same. Therefore, it\n\nwas contended that the trial Court ought to have\n\ngranted temporary injunction against invocation of\n\nthose bank guarantees pending adjudication of such\n\ndispute. Whereas respondent No.1 contends that the\n\nbank    guarantees    were        independent   agreements\n\nbetween it and respondent No.2 and could be enforced\n\nat any time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">       25.   In view of such contentions, this Court has\n\nto firstly examine whether contract of bank guarantees\n\nwere    independent    of    underlying     contract   and\n\nadjudication of the dispute between the parties to the\n\nunderlying contract was a precondition for invoking\n\nthose bank guarantees.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                              MFA No.2825/2018</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                              18</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">     26.     Clause 1 of all the five bank guarantees\n\nrefer to the purpose of issuing the same and the sum\n\nfor which they were issued. They state that the bank\n\nguarantees are issued as security against any loss or\n\ndamage caused or suffered or would be caused or\n\nsuffered under the terms and conditions of letter of\n\naward dated 18.09.2015 (main contract) between the\n\nfirst respondent and the appellant. Relying on such\n\nclause, it was argued that the bank guarantees were\n\nintertwined with the principal agreement, therefore,\n\nthey were not independent contracts.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_62\">     27.     But Clause 2 of all the five bank guarantees\n\nrefer to the nature of the agreement between the\n\nbank/respondent      No.2    and    respondent      No.1        the\n\nbeneficiary of the bank guarantees. Clause 2 in all the\n\nbank guarantees were identical and read as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">           &quot;2.

It is not only in\n           form but also in substance a negative injunction. It\n           has no positive content.

It does not direct\n           that the appellant shall pay such amounts to the\n           respondent. The appellant can still refuse to pay\n           such amounts if it thinks it has a valid defence and\n           if the appellant does so, the only remedy open to\n           the respondent would be to take measures in an\n           appropriate forum for recovery of such amounts\n           where it would be decided whether the appellant is\n           liable to pay such amounts to the respondent or\n           not.

Fraud:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">      34.     Having regard to the above referred legal\n\nposition, the question is whether the plaintiff has made\n\nout any such case of fraud and irretrievable injury. It is\n\nneedless to say that whenever party pleads fraud, he\n\nhas to plead particulars of fraud. The entire pleadings of\n\nthe appellant with regard to fraud is in para 13 of the\n\nplaint which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">              &quot;13. It is necessary to state that as per the\n      earlier letter of correspondence by the defendant no.1\n      and as per the joint analysis nothing was payable.\n      However, with an ulterior motive, malafide intention and\n      with an intention to play fraud upon the plaintiff\n      company, the defendant No.1 company falsely and\n      fabricatedly sent the bank guarantees for encashment.\n      It is stated that the bank guarantee cannot be invoked\n      since there is no breach. Similarly, the defendant no.1\n      has themselves issued a joint statement about no dues,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                          MFA No.2825/2018</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                       25</span>\n\n\n\n      etc.   Thus,   changing     their     stand   thereafter   is   not\n      justified. There is no reason whatsoever for encashment\n      of bank guarantee and the act of the defendant no.1 is\n      no less than a nature of fraud. It is on account of such\n\n      fraud played upon the plaintiff by the defendant no.1\n      company,       the   plaintiff    has    no   other   alternative\n      efficacious remedy then to approach this Hon&#x27;ble Court\n      seeking    permanent         injunction       as    against     the\n      encashment of bank guarantee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">                      (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">      35.     Thorough reading of the above para makes\n\nit very clear that allegations regarding fraud were as\n\nbald as possible and not in conformity with the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_35\">Order VI Rule 4 of CPC</a>. At the most what\n\ncan be gathered from para 13 of the plaint is that, there\n\nwas no breach of contract by the plaintiff, respondent\n\nNo.1 despite issuing joint statement, changing its stand\n\nhas sent the bank guarantees for enforcement with\n\nulterior motive and that amounts to fraud.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\">      36.     Though        it    was         contended      that      bank\n\nguarantees were sought to be invoked with ulterior\n\nmotive, malafide intentions, it was not stated what was\n\nthat ulterior motive and malafide intentions.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                             MFA No.2825/2018</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                             26</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\">      37.   It was contended that respondent No.1\n\ncontrary to the terms of the contract changed I.I.A, the\n\nprice of reject coal and agreement with regard to joint\n\nreconciliation, that amounts to fraud.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">      38.   Then the question is whether breach of\n\ncontract amounts to fraud. As per Merriam-Webster&#x27;s\n\nlegal dictionary, definition of fraud is as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">             &quot;1a: specifically: intentional perversion of\n      truth in order to induce another to part with\n      something of value or to surrender a legal right\n      was accused of credit card fraud\n             b: an act of deceiving or misrepresenting :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">             2a: a person who is not what he or she\n      pretends to be : IMPOSTOR He claimed to be a\n      licensed psychologist, but he turned out to be\n      fraud. also : one who defrauds : CHEAT\n             b: one that is not what it seems or is\n      represented to be The UFO picture was proved to\n      be a fraud&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">      39.   Further, <a href=\"/doc/299780/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 17</a> of the Indian Contract\n\nAct, 1872 defines fraud as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">            &quot;17. &#x27;Fraud&#x27; defined.--&#x27;Fraud&#x27; means and\n      includes any of the following acts committed by a\n      party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by\n      his agent, with intent to deceive another party\n      thereto or his agent, or to induce him to enter into\n      the contract:--\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                              MFA No.2825/2018</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                             27</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">           (1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is\n     not true, by one who does not believe it to be true;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">           (2) the active concealment of a fact by one\n     having knowledge or belief of the fact;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">           (3) a promise made without any intention of\n     performing it;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">           (4) any other act fitted to deceive;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">           (5) any such act or omission as the law\n     specially declares to be fraudulent.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">           Explanation.--Mere silence as to facts likely\n     to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a\n     contract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of\n     the case are such that, regard being had to them,\n     it is the duty of the person keeping silence to\n     speak, or unless his silence, is, in itself, equivalent\n     to speech.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">     40.   Thus it is clear that the breach of the terms\n\nof the contract in itself does not constitute an act of\n\nfraud in terms of definition in Merriam-Webster&#x27;s\n\ndictionary and <a href=\"/doc/299780/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 17</a> of the Indian Contract Act. It\n\nwas not the contention of learned Counsel for the\n\nappellant that such alleged breach constitutes fraud\n\nunder any other special law as contemplated under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1425782/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 17(5)</a> of the Indian Contract Act. Therefore no\n\nprima-facie case of fraud much less the established\n\nfraud was made out. If there is any breach of contract\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                               MFA No.2825/2018</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                              28</span>\n\n\n\non the part of defendant No.1 leading to damages to the\n\nplaintiff, its remedy may be for recovery of damages or\n\nother reliefs in appropriate proceedings not by way of\n\nsuit for bare injunction as claimed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">Reg. Egregious Injury\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">      41.    So far as egregious injury, the appellant\n\ncontended    that    the   amount    of   bank    guarantees\n\nconstitutes its     entire working     capital, if they       are\n\nenforced,   appellant&#x27;s    whole    business    comes    to    a\n\ngrinding    halt    causing   irretrievable    injury.   While\n\nconsidering the application for injunction, the Court has\n\nto examine who will be put to irretrievable injury and\n\nthe balance of convenience lies in whose favour.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">      42.    According to respondent No.1, the appellant\n\nis due to pay around Rs.57,00,00,000/- towards missing\n\ncoal, interest, penalty etc. If appellant&#x27;s whole working\n\ncapital itself is Rs.30,00,00,000/- and if respondent\n\nNo.1 succeeds, then it will be left with nothing to\n\nrecover its due. Contrary to that, respondent No.1 is a\n\npublic sector undertaking. It is not even the case of the\n\nappellant that respondent No.1 is likely to shut down its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                           MFA No.2825/2018</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                            29</span>\n\n\n\nestablishment and run away. Under such circumstances,\n\neven if relief of interim injunction is declined, the\n\nappellant has remedy to sue respondent No.1 for\n\nappropriate relief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">      43.   As discussed above, no case of established\n\nfraud or egregious loss was made out by the appellant.\n\nTherefore, the appellant had no prima-facie case of right\n\nor injury to its right. When no prima-facie case was\n\nmade out, the question of considering the balance of\n\nconvenience does not arise. Even otherwise, balance of\n\nconvenience was in favour of respondent No.1.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">      44.   It is clear that that the trial Court exercised\n\nits discretion in rejecting the injunction applications on\n\nsound appreciation of the material on record and the\n\nlegal position. The impugned order does not suffer any\n\narbitrariness or perversity warranting the interference of\n\nthis Court.
