Ltd. \n(&quot;the Developer&quot;) on the basis of Award dated 29.3.1994 given by the \nArbitrator in the above court for want of jurisdiction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\tThe Developer is a private limited company having its registered \noffice at Saket, New Delhi. On 16.3.1990 an Agreement was entered into by \nthe Developer with one Jatinder Nath (appellant herein). At that time, the \nappellant was residing at Faridabad. Under the above agreement, the \nDeveloper agreed to construct a housing complex on a plot bearing No.       \nG-13, Saket, New Delhi. Under the said Agreement, the Developer agreed to \nfinance the construction from its own resources. Clauses 11, 20 and 21 of the \nsaid agreement read as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;11.\tIn case of any dispute arising between the parties \nin this respect, the matter shall be referred to the \nSole Arbitrator for his valuable decision and his \ndecision shall be final and binding on both the \nparties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">20.\tThat in case of any dispute arising between the \nparties in respect of these presents, the same shall \nbe referred for arbitration to the sole Arbitrator. \nShri Damodar Sharma, 5-N/35, NIT Faridabad \nshall be the sole Arbitrator and the decision shall \nbe binding on both the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">21.\tThe agreement has been entered into between the \nparties at Faridabad and the Faridabad Courts \nonly shall have the jurisdiction in case of any \ndispute between the parties to the said \nagreement.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">\tIn terms of the said agreement, when the dispute arose between the \nparties, the appellant herein requested for a reference to the named \nArbitrator. This was vide letter dated 20.8.1992. The Arbitrator entered upon \nthe reference on 24.8.1992. He fixed the hearing on 5.9.1992 on which date \nthe appellant remained present at the venue of arbitration. However, neither \nthe arbitrator nor the Developer was present. Suddenly after fourteen \nmonths, the arbitrator purported to act. He fixed the matter for hearing on \n20.2.1994. Since the entire matter was pending before the Delhi High Court \nwhich was moved by the appellant herein under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_2\">section 20</a>, the arbitrator \nwas requested not to proceed. Despite the request, the arbitrator proceeded to \ngive his Award (ex parte). This was on 29.3.1994.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">To complete the chronology of events, it may be pointed out that the \nDeveloper (first respondent herein) filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_3\">section 14</a> of \nthe Act for filing the Award in the court of Additional Civil Judge (Sr. Div.), \nFaridabad (for short &quot;the trial court&quot;). Notice of the said application  was  \nalso  given  to the  appellant herein.  The appellant herein appeared and filed \nhis objections. He objected to the jurisdiction of the trial court. According to \nthe appellant, the suit land stood located in Saket, New Delhi and, therefore, \nthe trial court had no jurisdiction to pass the decree in terms of the said \nAward. This was the basic objection raised by the appellant before us. Apart \nfrom his objection on territorial jurisdiction, the appellant also submitted \nbefore the trial court that the Arbitrator had issued notice dated 24.8.1992 \nfixing the date of hearing on 5.9.1992. However, when his advocate reached \nthe residence of the Arbitrator on the date fixed, neither the Arbitrator nor \nthe Developer had turned up. The appellant also contended before the trial \ncourt that the Award was not made within the period of four months from \nentering upon the reference and, therefore, the Arbitrator had become \nfunctus officio. He further pointed out to the trial court that an application \nunder <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_4\">section 20</a> of the Act has also been filed in the High Court by him for \nfiling the arbitration agreement in court. The appellant submitted that despite \nraising the above objections before the Artbitrator, the Arbitrator proceeded \nto pass an ex parte Award dated 29.3.1994. The appellant further pointed out \nthat the Developer had filed a suit for permanent injunction in the Court of \nSenior Sub-Judge, Delhi and that the Developer had sought intervention of \nthe civil court for adjudication of the dispute and, in the circumstances, the \nArbitrator could not have made an ex parte Award dated 29.3.1994. \nAccording to the appellant, the said ex parte Award passed by the Arbitrator \nwas in violation of the provisions of the Act; that it was non est, and, \ntherefore, the same could not be made rule of the Court. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">The trial court on the basis of the above pleadings framed several \nissues. Two of the six issues were, whether Award dated 29.3.1994 was    \nnon est as the Arbitrator had become functus officio and whether the trial \ncourt had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the matter since the suit lands \nare located in Saket, New Delhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">By impugned judgment dated 24.9.1996, the trial court held that in \nview of <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_5\">section 31(4)</a> of the Act, since the land in question stood located in \nSaket, New Delhi and since the appellant herein is the resident of Delhi and \nsince the Developer was carrying on business in Delhi the trial court had no \nterritorial jurisdiction to pass the decree in terms of the Award. The trial \ncourt rejected the contention of the Developer that the subject matter of the \nreference was the contract between the parties; that under the contract, the \ndispute, if any, was to be referred for arbitration in Faridabad; that under the \ncontract, the dispute was referable to the sole arbitrator whose decision was \nto bind both the parties. The trial court also rejected the contention of the \nDeveloper that the agreement was entered into between the parties at \nFaridabad and that the Faridabad court alone had the jurisdiction to decide \nthe above dispute. The trial court also rejected the contention of the \nDeveloper that on the date of execution of the agreement, the appellant \nherein was residing in Faridabad. On the merits of the case, the trial court \nfound that the appellant herein had moved a petition under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_6\">section 20</a> of the \nAct on 14.10.1993 in the Delhi High Court which was registered as Suit No. \n2482/93 wherein it was prayed that an independent arbitrator be appointed \nand the matter be referred for arbitration. On 14.10.1993 the Arbitrator had \nnot made the award. On 14.10.1993 the period of four months had expired. \nThe trial court found that after the institution of petition under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_7\">section 20</a> of \nthe Act on 14.10.1993, the arbitrator, suddenly, after a lapse of almost  \nfourteen months from the date of his entering upon the reference, made an   \nex parte Award against the appellant on 29.3.1994. According to the trial \ncourt, though the agreement (Ex. P-1) stood executed at Faridabad, the \nvalidity of that agreement and the dispute arising therefrom have to be \ndecided in the civil court at Delhi since the property in question stood \nlocated in Saket, New Delhi. According to the trial court, the Developer had \nmoved an application under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_8\">section 14</a> of the Act on 12.4.1994, by that \napplication, the Developer sought a decree from the trial court at Faridabad \nin terms of the ex parte Award. On 12.4.1994, according to the trial court, \nthe appellant herein was residing in Delhi, he was served with the summons \nat his residential address in Delhi coupled with the fact that the suit property \nwas in Delhi and, therefore, the trial court at Faridabad had no territorial \njurisdiction to entertain and try the Developer&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_9\">section 14</a> \nof the Act. According to the trial court, there was one more reason for saying \nthat it had no territorial jurisdiction. According to the trial court the \nagreement (Ex. P-1), pertained to immovable property at Saket and when a \ndispute arose between the parties, the appellant herein had moved the Delhi \nHigh Court under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_10\">section 20</a> of the Act in which the address of the appellant \nwas shown as G-13, Saket, New Delhi. The trial court also look into account \none more circumstance, namely, that the Developer had instituted Civil Suit \nNo. 945/92 against the appellant herein. In that suit, the Developer had asked \nfor a decree for permanent injunction. In that suit the appellant herein was \nthe defendant. In that suit, the address of the appellant as defendant was also \nshown as G-13, Saket, New Delhi. In the circumstances, the trial court held \nthat the Developer had invoked the territorial jurisdiction of the Delhi High \nCourt much prior to his application under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_11\">section 14</a> of the Act to the trial \ncourt herein on 12.4.1994. In the circumstances, the trial court held that the \nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/169730061/\" id=\"a_12\">section 16</a> CPC was not applicable and that the application filed \nby the Developer under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_13\">section 14</a> of the Act dated 12.4.1994 should have \nbeen instituted in the Delhi Court within the local limits of whose \njurisdiction the suit property stood located. In the circumstances, it was held \nby the trial court that clause 21 of the agreement conferring jurisdiction to \nthe Faridabad court cannot be implemented. The trial court observed that \nsince the appellant had moved the Delhi High Court under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_14\">section 20</a> of the \nAct for appointment of a new arbitrator in the year 1993 and since that \napplication was prior to 12.4.1994 and since that application was anterior to \nthe reference, the appellant&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_15\">section 20</a> of the Act fell \nwithin the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_16\">section 31(4)</a> of the Act. According to the trial court, \nsince a petition under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_17\">section 20</a> of the Act was pending prior to 12.4.1994 \nin the Delhi High Court, the Developer should have moved his application \nunder <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_18\">section 14</a> also before the Delhi High Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"763774\" id=\"span_1\">In this connection \nreliance was placed on the judgment of this court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/763774/\" id=\"a_19\">Union of \nIndia  v.  Surjeet Singh Atwal</a> reported in AIR 1970 SC 189. Aggrieved by \ndecision of the trial court dated 24.9.1996, the Developer moved the Delhi \nHigh Court by way of the CRA. In the CRA the Developer contended that \nunder the agreement (Ex. P-1) vide clause 21 it was agreed between the \nparties that the Faridabad courts alone shall have the jurisdiction in case of \nany dispute between the parties and, therefore, the trial court had territorial \njurisdiction to entertain and try application dated 12.4.1994 under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_20\">section 14</a> \nof the Act. It was contended, in the alternative, that where two courts have \nconcurrent jurisdiction, the parties by agreement can choose the jurisdiction \nof one of them and such a choice was not against the public policy. It was \ncontended that an agreement whereby jurisdiction of the court stood \nspecified was not contrary to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_21\">section 28</a> of the Contract Act and to the public \npolicy. It was further contended that where two courts had territorial \njurisdiction to try a case, it is open to the parties to enter into an agreement \nwhereby jurisdiction of the court stood specified. On behalf of the Developer \nit was further contended that, at the time of execution of the agreement (Ex. \nP-1) the appellant herein resided at Faridabad and his subsequent change of \naddress cannot change clause 21 of the agreement. It was further urged on \nbehalf of the Developer that an application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_22\">section 20</a> of the Act was \nfiled by the appellant herein in the Delhi High Court and it had no relevance \nwith clause 21 of Ex. P-1. According to the Developer, filing of such suit \nunder <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_23\">section 20</a> of the Act before the Delhi High Court cannot alter the \nterms of Ex. P-1. It was further urged on behalf of the Developer that it had \ninstituted the above suit for permanent injunction in the Delhi High Court. \nThat suit was Suit No. 945/92 for permanent injunction which was for a \nrelief which had no correlation with the arbitration matter. Moreover, that \nsuit was for permanent injunction. Such a suit could have been filed in Delhi \ncourts alone as in that suit it was alleged that the appellant herein was \nattempting to interfere with the Developer&#x27;s possession. Such a suit did not \nconstitute a waiver. On behalf of the Developer, it was further urged that the \ntrial court had erred in coming to the conclusion that Ex. P-1 cannot be given \neffect as the suit property was located at Saket,  NewDelhi and that the \nparties were residing at Delhi.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">On behalf of the appellant herein, it was sought to be argued before \nthe High Court that although Ex. P-1 was executed at Faridabad and \nalthough at the relevant time the appellant resided in Faridabad, the dispute \nwas in connection with recovery of possession and, therefore, the civil court \nat Faridabad had no jurisdiction to entertain, try and dispose of the \nDeveloper&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_24\">section 14</a> of the Act. It was also urged that \nsubsequently the appellant had shifted his residence from Faridabad to Saket \nin New Delhi and, therefore, the trial court was right in refusing to entertain \nthe Developer&#x27;s application dated 12.4.1994 under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_25\">section 14</a> of the Act. \nAccordingly, on behalf of the appellant herein it was urged that no \ninterference is called for in the CRA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">By the impugned judgment, the High Court held that Delhi High \nCourt was not a competent court as the parties had chosen to confer \nexclusive jurisdiction upon the Faridabad court. In the circumstances, \n<a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_26\">section 31(4)</a> of the Act was not applicable. The High <a href=\"/doc/763774/\" id=\"a_27\">Court further held</a> that \nthere was no waiver on the part of the Developer by invocation of the \njurisdiction of the Delhi court when the respondent instituted Suit No. \n945/92 for permanent injunction. The High Court held that Suit No. 945/92 \nhad no correlation  with the arbitration matter. The High <a href=\"/doc/763774/\" id=\"a_28\">Court further held</a>, \nthat on the facts and circumstances of the present case, <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_29\">section 20</a> CPC was \napplicable; that <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_30\">section 20</a> CPC refers to institution of suits other than those \ncovered by <a href=\"/doc/169730061/\" id=\"a_31\">section 16</a> CPC on the basis of residence of  defendant or cause \nof action. In the circumstances, the High Court allowed the Revision Petition \nholding, that the trial court at Faridabad had jurisdiction to entertain and try \napplication dated 12.4.1994 under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_32\">section 14</a> of the Act; that <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_33\">section 31(4)</a> of \nthe Act was not attracted; that the arbitrator had entered upon reference on \nthe application of appellant herein and, therefore, there was no occasion for \nthe appellant moving the Delhi High Court under <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_34\">section 20</a> CPC seeking \nreference. Hence this civil appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">As stated above, the short point which arises for determination in this \ncivil appeal is whether application dated 12.4.1994 filed by the Developer in \nthe trial court at Faridabad was maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">At this stage, it may be mentioned that the trial court at Faridabad \nfollowing the impugned judgment of the High Court had dismissed the \nobjections of the appellant herein and it has made said Award dated \n29.3.1994 the rule of the court. This was on 31.5.2006. On 23.1.2007 the \nDeveloper&#x27;s Suit No. 945/92 for permanent injunction stood dismissed in \ndefault.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">The basic point which needs to be decided by us is whether clause 21 \nof Agreement dated 16.3.1990 (Ex. P-1) conferring jurisdiction on the \nFaridabad court was ineffective and whether the appellant is right in his \ncontention that the application made by the Developer under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_35\">section 14</a> of \nthe Act was not maintainable in the Faridabad court on the ground of lack of \nterritorial jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">Mr. Sunil Gupta, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \nappellant submitted that the Award made by the arbitrator dated 29.3.1994 \nbeing an ex parte Award was non est as it was passed after expiry of four \nmonths from the date when the arbitrator entered upon the reference. He \ncontended that on 20.8.1992 the appellant had referred the dispute to the \narbitrator. On 24.8.1992 the arbitrator entered upon the reference and fixed \nthe date of hearing on 5.9.1992 on which date the appellant was present. On \nthat date neither the arbitrator nor the Developer was present. On that date, \nthe appellant herein sought the next date of hearing. Despite the telegram \nseeking the next date of hearing, the arbitrator did not respond. During the \nperiod October, 1992 and November, 1992 disputes arose when the MCD \nhad issued notices directing the appellant herein to show cause why the \nbuilding plan submitted by the Developer should not be revoked. Learned \ncounsel pointed out that on 15.10.1992 the Developer had in fact instituted \nSuit No. 945/92 in the civil court at Delhi for permanent injunction. In that \nsuit, vide para 16, the Developer had invoked jurisdiction of the Delhi court. \nIn the circumstances, it was not open to the Developer to move the trial court \nat Faridabad on 12.4.1994 under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_36\">section 14</a> of the Act. Learned counsel \nurged that both the parties were aware that the dispute was in respect of the \nsuit property located at Saket in New Delhi. The dispute, according to the \nlearned counsel, was for possession of the suit property. The appellant herein \nhad sought possession of the suit property even before the arbitrator. The \nAward of the arbitrator, according to the learned counsel, itself indicates that \nthe arbitrator has given relief in favour of the Developer concerning \nimmovable property and, therefore, the trial court was right in coming to the \nconclusion that the application made on 12.4.1994 under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_37\">section 14</a> by the \nDeveloper was not maintainable on the ground of territorial jurisdiction in \nview of <a href=\"/doc/1684349/\" id=\"a_38\">section 31(4)</a> of the Act. The second contention advanced on behalf \nof the appellant before us was that the impugned Award dated 29.3.1994 \nwas non est. According to the learned counsel, four months time available to \nthe arbitrator under clause 3 of Schedule I read with <a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_39\">section 3</a> of the Act \nexpired on 24.12.1992.After that date the arbitrator became functus officio. \nIn the circumstances, the appellant herein filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_40\">section \n20</a> of the Act on 14.10.1993 before the Delhi High Court for appointment of \nan arbitrator for adjudication of the dispute with the Developer. This \napplication was converted into Suit No. 2482/93. It is only thereafter that the \narbitrator suddenly purported to act as an arbitrator by fixing the date of \nhearing on 20.2.1994 when the appellant herein requested the arbitrator in \nthe light of the above facts not to proceed with the arbitration proceedings \nsince the entire matter was before Delhi High Court in Suit No. 2482/93. \nDespite the request made by the appellant, the arbitrator proceeded to make \nan Award dated 29.3.1994 being an ex parte Award. Learned counsel further \npointed out that in fact prior to his application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_41\">section 20</a>, M.C.D. had \nrevoked the sanction for construction of the complex and it was the appellant \nherein who had filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court being Writ \nPetition No. 5038/93 against the revocation by M.C.D..\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">On the first question on the lack of territorial jurisdiction, we do not \nfind any merit in the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellant. We \nhave examined Ex. P-1 between the appellant and the builder (Developer) \ndated 16.3.1990. The agreement describes the appellant as the owner. It \ndescribes M/s Chopra Land Development Pvt. Ltd. as the builder. Under the \nagreement, the appellant remains the owner. Under the agreement, the \nappellant applies to D.D.A. for time to construct a housing complex on a \nplot of land at Saket owned by the appellant. Under the agreement, the \nDeveloper agrees to construct a housing complex on the plot bearing No.    \nG-13, Saket, New Delhi. Under the agreement, the entire construction cost is \nfinanced by the Developer. Under the agreement, the housing complex \nconsisted of basement, ground floor, mezzanine first floor, second floor and \nthird floor. Under the agreement, the Developer agreed to construct the \nhousing complex without prejudice to the owner&#x27;s right. Under the \nagreement, the owner was required to give permission to the builder to \nconstruct the housing complex. Under the agreement, the entire cost of \nconstruction was to be borne by the Developer. Under the agreement, the \nbuilding plan, the completion certificate etc. were to be signed by the \nappellant-owner. Under the agreement, vide clause 15, the Developer agreed \nto pay to the appellant-owner a sum of Rs. 5 lacs in consideration of his \nseeking permission to construct the housing complex. This was in addition \nto the construction cost to be incurred by the Developer. Clause 16 of the \nagreement stated that in consideration of the Developer&#x27;s services to \nconstruct the housing complex, the appellant agrees to allow the ownership \nof the basement, ground floor and mezzanine along with proportionate \ninterest in the land to be transferred in the name of the Developer. At this \nstage, it may be noted that under the ex parte Award dated 29.3.1994 the \narbitrator has passed his Award in terms of para 16 and, therefore, it was \ncontended before us on behalf of the appellant that the dispute related to \npossession of the property; that the dispute was comparable to a suit for land \nand that the submission was made specifically in view of the Award being \npassed in terms of para 16 of the agreement (Ex. P-1). It was urged that since \nthe arbitrator has passed the Award directing the appellant to transfer the \nownership of basement, ground floor, mezzanine along with the \nproportionate interest in the land in favour of the Developer, the present \ndispute related to recovery of possession and since the lands were located in \nSaket the trial court had no jurisdiction to make the Award rule of the court \nunder <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_42\">section 14</a> of the Act. As stated above, we do not find merit in the \ncontention advanced on behalf of the appellant. We have examined Ex. P-1 \nin entirety. Apart from the above clauses of Ex. P-1, we have already quoted \nclauses 11, 20, and 21 by which the parties agreed that in case of dispute \nbetween the parties the same shall be referred for arbitration to the sole \narbitrator at Faridabad and his decision shall be binding on both the parties. \nUnder clause 21, the parties agreed that the Faridabad court alone shall have \nthe jurisdiction in case of any dispute between the parties. On our examining \nthe terms and conditions of Ex. P-1 along with the surrounding \ncircumstances thereto, we are of the view that Ex. P-1 was a pure \nDevelopment Agreement. The agreement is merely an agreement whereby a \nparty agrees to develop certain property for a certain consideration. Under \nthe agreement, the appellant herein continues to remain the owner. He has to \napply for permission to construct the building to the D.D.A.. The Developer \nagrees to construct on the land. The Developer agrees to finance the entire \nconstruction cost and in lieu of the Developer&#x27;s services in the matter of \nconstruction of housing complex the owner (appellant herein) agrees to \npermit transfer of the ownership a part of the complex to the Developer. It is \nfor this reason, as indicated by the events enumerated above, that M.C.D. \nhad issued notice to the appellant on 21.9.1992 to show cause why the \nbuilding plan submitted should not be revoked. It is for the above reasons, \nthat M.C.D. ultimately revoked the sanction for the construction of the \nhousing complex on 18.5.1993 and it is the appellant herein as owner who \nhad sought to challenge the revocation vide Writ Petition No. 5038/93. On \nthe facts of this case, therefore, it cannot be said that the trial court at \nFaridabad had no jurisdiction to make the Award the rule of the court under \n<a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_43\">section 14</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 31(1)</a> of the Act provides that an Award may \nbe filed in any court having jurisdiction in the matter to which the reference \nrelates. Under that section, the Award can be filed in the court within whose \njurisdiction the property in dispute lies. Parties cannot give jurisdiction to a \ncourt under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_45\">section 14</a> by consent if that court does not has jurisdiction. If an \naward refers to an immovable property, the court having jurisdiction in \nrespect of the same will entertain an application under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_46\">section 14</a>. In order to \ndecide as to which court has jurisdiction to entertain a petition under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_47\">section \n14</a>,  reference has to be made to <a href=\"/doc/105873/\" id=\"a_48\">section 2(c)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_49\">section 31(1)</a> of the \nAct. Merely because the arbitrator chooses to hold the proceedings in a place \nwhere no suit could be instituted, and chooses to make an award at that \nplace, it would not give the court of that place territorial jurisdiction to \ndecide the matter under the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 30</a> refers to ground for setting aside \nan award. <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 30</a> is to be read with <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_52\">section 33</a>. The idea behind the entire \nscheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_53\">Arbitration Act</a> appears to be that an application by a party \nchallenging the validity of correctness of the award on whatever ground has \nto be made under <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_54\">section 33</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 33</a> is the only section under which a \nparty is given the right to apply to the court to challenge either the \nagreement or the award. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_56\">Under the Act</a>, therefore, after the Award has been \nfiled a party is permitted to make an application under <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_57\">section 33</a> to bring all \nkinds of defects to the notice of the court and the court will give reliefs \neither under <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_58\">section 15</a> or <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_59\">section 16</a> or even under <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_60\">section 30</a> of the Act. In \nan arbitration without the intervention of the court, an award can be filed in \nany court having jurisdiction in the matter to which the reference relates.  \nThe award can be filed only in the court which would have jurisdiction in \nrespect of the subject matter of the dispute. In order to decide the jurisdiction \nof the court, it is necessary to decide whether the court would have \njurisdiction to try a regular suit between the parties in which the relief is \nclaimed. <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 33</a> does not prescribe the court before which an application \nunder this section may be filed, but <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_62\">section 31</a> makes such provision. <a href=\"/doc/1604327/\" id=\"a_63\">Section \n31(2)</a> provides that all questions regarding the validity, effect or existence of \nan award or an arbitration agreement shall be decided by the court in which \nthe award has been filed or may be filed. <a href=\"/doc/105873/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 2(c)</a> lays down the forum. \nThe application has to be moved in the court within whose jurisdiction the \nopposite party resides or carries on business or within whose jurisdiction any \npart of the cause of action arises. Residence or carrying on business of a \nparty, apart from the place of accrual of a cause of action is relevant for \ndetermining the territorial jurisdiction of the court in arbitration cases, if the \nquestion so arises in connection with the subject matter of the dispute. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">Applying the above tests to the facts of the present case, we are of the \nview that at the relevant time the appellant resided at Faridabad. He resided \nat Faridabad when the contract was made. Under the contract, the parties \nagreed to refer all disputes to the Faridabad court. Apart from the residence, \nwe are also concerned with the place of accrual of the cause of action. In the \npresent case, a bare reading of the agreement indicates that it is an \nagreement to develop. The appellant remains the owner, the Developer \nremains the contractor. The Developer is the financer. The appellant is the \nowner of an asset. The contractor/ Developer agrees to exploit that asset on \nbehalf of the owner. The Developer funds the scheme. The building plans \nremained in the name of the owner. The D.D.A. informs the owner regarding \nrevocation of the building plan. The owner files the writ petition challenging \nthe revocation. The contractor is paid consideration in terms of a part of the \nproperty. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that this case is similar to a \nsuit for land. One cannot look at para 16 alone in isolation. On the other \nhand, with open eyes, the parties had entered into the contract, they had \nagreed to refer all disputes to an arbitrator at Faridabad and they had agreed \nthat the Faridabad court alone shall have jurisdiction. In a matter of this \nkind, it cannot be said that the claim is similar to a suit for land. A housing \ncomplex has to be constructed at the site. When dispute arises, it will not be \nconfined only to immovable property. Such disputes also require accounts to \nbe maintained. The disputes also involve rendition of accounts. In the \ncircumstances, in our view, <a href=\"/doc/86911060/\" id=\"a_65\">section 20</a> CPC alone is attracted. Therefore, in \nour view, the High Court was right in holding that the Faridabad court had \njurisdiction to make the Award the rule of the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">As stated above, one of the points raised on behalf of the appellant \nherein is that ex parte Award dated 29.3.1994 was non est since it was made \nbeyond four months from the date when the arbitrator entered upon the \nreference. We do not find any merit in this contention. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_66\">Chapter II of the \nArbitration Act</a> covers references, in which the parties may proceed, if \nnothing goes wrong, up to the stage of delivery of the award, without the \nintervention of the court. This does not mean that the court has no authority \nto intervene at an early stage, should it become necessary. In the present \ncase, as stated above, the arbitrator entered upon a reference pursuant to the \nnotice given by the appellant on 24.8.1992. The notice was given on \n20.8.1992. Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_67\">section 8</a> of the Act has no application. <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 8</a> \napplies only  where the parties do not concur in the appointment. <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 8</a> \nand <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_70\">section 20</a> operate in different provinces. <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 20</a> confers power on \nthe court to order the agreement to be filed and to make an order of reference \nto the arbitrator appointed by the parties or where they do not agree, the \ncourt can appoint any other person of its choice as an arbitrator. This \ndiscussion is important. This difference between <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_72\">section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_73\">section 20</a> \nshows that the reference flows from an agreement between the parties in the \ncases falling under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_74\">section 8</a>. The reference flows from the agreement in \ncases falling under <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_75\">Chapter II of the Arbitration Act</a> and as long as the \nagreement stands, the reference remains valid unless it is superseded by an \norder of the court under <a href=\"/doc/710617/\" id=\"a_76\">section 19</a>. Under that section, where award \nbecomes void under <a href=\"/doc/186495/\" id=\"a_77\">section 16(3)</a> or where an award is set aside, the court \nmay by an order supersede the reference and shall thereupon order that the \narbitration agreement shall cease to have effect. Therefore, till such time as \nthe order is passed by the court under <a href=\"/doc/710617/\" id=\"a_78\">section 19</a> superseding the reference, \nthe same shall remain valid till the agreement is superseded. This is the \nscope of <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_79\">section 8</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/710617/\" id=\"a_80\">section 19</a> of the Act. On the other hand, in \ncases falling under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_81\">section 20</a> of the Act, power is conferred on the court to \nmake an order of reference to the arbitrator. That power is conferred on the \ncourt which orders the agreement to be filed before it. In a proceeding under \n<a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_82\">section 8</a>, disputes are presented by the parties before the arbitrator. Whereas \nin proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_83\">section 20</a>, the disputes are referred by the court. It is \nfor this reason that it has been repeatedly held that merely because an \narbitrator does not make an award within the specified period of four months \nthe court has the power to extend the period. The award given by an \narbitrator after four months is not binding on the parties. Such an award is \nvitiated as the arbitrator has no power to make an award after four months. \nHowever, a bare failure of an arbitrator to make an award within the time \nallowed by law will not involve the consequences of it being set aside only \non that ground. The court has ample powers in a given case to extend the \ntime and give life to the vitiated award by exercising judicial discretion \nunder <a href=\"/doc/597719/\" id=\"a_84\">section 28</a> of the Act. An application to have the award set aside on \nthe ground that it was made beyond time prescribed has to be moved under \nthe Act. No separate suit would lie for that purpose. <a href=\"/doc/597719/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 28</a> is not limited \nonly to references to arbitration made in a suit pending before the court. \nFurther, the  power given to the court under <a href=\"/doc/597719/\" id=\"a_86\">section 28</a> is so wide that it can \nextend the time even if the award is made beyond four months from the date \nof the arbitrator entering upon the reference. The only restriction is that it \nmust be exercised with judicial discretion. In the present case, as state above, \nthe Developer moved an application for making the award the rule of the \ncourt on 12.4.1994. Unfortunately, the appellant chose not to appear before \nthe trial court. In the circumstances, an ex parte decree came to be passed on \n31.5.2006. We have used the word unfortunately because the appellant \nherein had filed his objections before the trial court. Those objections were \ndismissed as he chose to remain absent. The appellant chose to remain \nabsent as he had moved or decided to move this Court in special leave \npetition against the impugned judgment of the High Court on the point of \nterritorial jurisdiction. The judgment of the High Court is dated 19.4.2006. \nThe Award is made the rule of the court by the trial court on 31.5.2006 in \nview of the impugned judgment of the High Court. We have also gone \nthrough the Award. We do not wish to express any opinion on the merits, \nhowever, the fact remains that the arbitrator entered upon the reference on \n24.8.1992. He fixed the date of hearing on 5.9.1992. On 5.9.1992 the \nappellant appeared before him. The arbitrator was absent. The Award has \nbeen given almost after fourteen months and that too after 14.10.1993 when \nthe appellant herein moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_87\">section 20</a> of the Act for \nappointment of a new arbitrator. Taking into account the above \ncircumstances, we set aside the ex parte Order dated 31.5.2006 passed by the \ntrial court at Faridabad making Award dated 29.3.1994 the rule of the court. \nConsequently, we direct restoration of the matter to the file of the Court of \nAdditional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Faridabad in Case No. 7 instituted \non 12.4.1994 titled M/s Chopra Land Developers Pvt. Ltd.  v.  Jatinder \nNath and anr.. We may clarify that the trial court will proceed on the basis \nthat it has territorial jurisdiction to decide the application made by the \nDeveloper under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_88\">sections 14</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1171700/\" id=\"a_89\">17</a> of the Act. The said application will be \ndecided on merits alone in accordance with law. In other words, the trial \ncourt will re-examine the question on merits as to whether the Award given \nby the arbitrator on 29.3.1994 should or should not be made the rule of the \ncourt. The trial court will have to decide whether to extend the period for \nmaking the Award or not, whether to supercede the reference or not. The \ntrial court will proceed in accordance with law. Any observation on the \nmerits of the case mentioned hereinabove shall not be treated as opinion of \nthis Court. Further, the trial court will proceed on the basis that it has \nterritorial jurisdiction to decide the above matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">Subject to above, the civil appeal is dismissed with no order as to \ncosts.\n</p>","numcites":21,"numcitedby":51,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":391413,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 20 of cpc","formInput":"section%2020%20of%20cpc"},{"value":"suit for permanent injunction","formInput":"suit%20for%20permanent%20injunction"},{"value":"when does arbitrator enter reference","formInput":"when%20does%20arbitrator%20enter%20reference"},{"value":"permanent injunction","formInput":"permanent%20injunction"},{"value":"territorial jurisdiction of court","formInput":"territorial%20jurisdiction%20of%20court"},{"value":"civil procedure code section 20","formInput":"civil%20procedure%20code%20section%2020"},{"value":"territorial jurisdiction","formInput":"territorial%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"functus officio","formInput":"functus%20officio"},{"value":"no jurisdiction of trial court","formInput":"no%20jurisdiction%20of%20trial%20court"},{"value":"ex parte ","formInput":"ex%20parte%20"},{"value":"\"section 20 CPC\" ","formInput":"%22section%2020%20CPC%22%20"},{"value":"\"permanent injunction\"","formInput":"%22permanent%20injunction%22"},{"value":" award by arbitrator","formInput":"%20award%20by%20arbitrator"},{"value":"agreement  - jurisdiction ","formInput":"agreement%20%20-%20jurisdiction%20"},{"value":"reference to arbitrator","formInput":"reference%20to%20arbitrator"},{"value":"sec 20  c.p.c.","formInput":"sec%2020%20%20c.p.c."},{"value":"developer agreement","formInput":"developer%20agreement"},{"value":"mezzanine floor","formInput":"mezzanine%20floor"},{"value":"faridabad","formInput":"faridabad"},{"value":"all section in cpc","formInput":"all%20section%20in%20cpc"}],"cats":[{"value":"application-to-file-in-arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:application-to-file-in-arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"appoint-arbitrator","formInput":"tag:appoint-arbitrator"},{"value":"arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
