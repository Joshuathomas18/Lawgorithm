The respondent (Insured) obtained a standard Fire and Special\n\nPerils (with a floater) Policy from the appellant (`Insurer&#x27;) to cover its\n\ngoods in its godowns situated at Surat for the period 4.8.2003 to\n\n3.8.2004. The sum insured was Rs. Three crores, subsequently\n\nincreased to Rs. Six crores. On 27.5.2004 the respondent requested\n\nthe insurer to increase the sum insured by another Rs. six crores for a\n\nperiod of two months. Accordingly, the appellant issued an additional\n\nendorsement increasing the sum insured by another Rupees six crores,\n\nin all Rupees twelve crores. The respondent alleges that the additional\n\nendorsement cover issued by the appellant was for 69 days, that is\n\nfrom 27.5.2004 to 3.8.2004. The appellant alleges that the additional\n\nendorsement cover was for a period of 60 days from 27.5.2004 to\n\n26.7.2004. (Note: The appellant claims that during subsequent\n\ninvestigations, it came to light that its AAO (Dilip Godbole) had\n\ndelivered to the respondent, a computer generated Additional\n\nEndorsement (unauthorisedly altered by hand) showing the period of\n\nadditional cover as 69 days up to 3.8.2004, and departmental\n\nproceedings have been initiated against the said officer).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                    3</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">3.    On 5.8.2004, the respondent reported loss/damage to their\n\nstocks on account of heavy rains and flooding which took place on\n\n2/3.8.2004 and made a claim in that behalf. The surveyor submitted a\n\npreliminary report dated 14.8.2004 followed by a final survey report\n\ndated 6.12.2004 according to which the net assessed loss (payable to\n\nrespondent) was Rs.3,18,26,025/-. The said sum was arrived at on the\n\nbasis that the sum insured was Rs.12 crores, the actual value of stocks\n\nin the godowns at risk was Rs.8,15,99,149/-, value of damaged goods\n\nwas Rs.5,22,81,001/-, and the recoverable salvage value was\n\nRs.1,87,79,922/-. The appellant informed the surveyor by letter dated\n\n1.3.2005 that there was an error in the net assessed loss arrived at by\n\nthe surveyor as it assumed the sum insured as Rs.12 crores up to\n\n3.8.2004 whereas the sum insured was only Rs.6 crores after\n\n26.7.2004 till 3.8.2004, and therefore instructed the surveyor to\n\nprepare the final report regarding net assessed loss by taking the sum\n\ninsured as only Rupees six crores. The surveyor therefore gave an\n\naddendum to the final survey report on 22.3.2005 reassessing the net\n\nloss by taking the sum insured as only Rupees six crores. The value of\n\ngoods at risk, the value of damaged goods and the value of\n\nrecoverable salvage remained unaltered. By modifying the percentage\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                     4</span>\n\n\nof insurance at 75.53%, the `Net Assessed Loss&#x27; was re-worked as\n\nRs.2,34,01,740/-. The respondent protested against the loss being\n\nassessed by taking the sum insured as only Rupees six crores. The\n\nclaim and the dispute were pending consideration for a considerable\n\ntime.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">4.      The respondent alleged that the appellant forced the respondent\n\nto accept a lower settlement; that the appellant informed the\n\nrespondent that unless and until the respondent issued an undated\n\n`Discharge     voucher-in-advance&#x27;       (in   the   prescribed   form)\n\nacknowledging receipt of Rs.2,33,94,964/- in full and final\n\nsettlement, no amount would be released towards the claim; that in\n\nthat behalf, the appellant sent the format of the discharge voucher to\n\nbe signed by respondent on 21.3.2006; that on account of the non-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">release of the claim, it was in a dire financial condition and it had no\n\nalternative but to yield to the coercion and pressure applied by the\n\nappellant; that therefore the respondent signed and gave the said\n\ndischarge voucher, undated, as required by the insurer during the last\n\nweek of March, 2006. The payment was released by the appellant\n\nonly after receiving the said discharge-voucher.

Simultaneously, the respondent lodged a complaint dated\n\n24.3.2006 with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority\n\nwherein, after setting out the facts, it alleged:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      &quot;We lodged a claim with our insurers immediately and pursued the\n      matter with them. Even after the Surveyor Mr. Mehernosh\n      Todiwala of M/s.

We had various meetings at the Divisional,\n      Regional and even the Head Office of the insurers, but to no avail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      In March, 2005, the insurer company forced us to accept a lower\n      settlement and we were told that we would have to agree to a lower\n      settlement to ensure expeditious settlement of the claim.\n      Accordingly on and around the 15th of March, 2005 nearly 8\n      months after the loss we gave our forced consent to the lower\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                           6</span>\n\n      settlement offered in the hope that the claim amount would be\n      received immediately.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      Thereafter for the next 1 year, the insurers failed to settle our claim\n      and made us run from pillar to post for the settlement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      Finally on March 21st 2006 the insurers have sent us a voucher for\n      the sum of Rs.2,33,94,94 which considering our dire financial\n      condition, and the continuous failed promises from the insurers, we\n      have had no choice but to accept.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      Sir, subsequent to the loss, since we could not pay our international\n      suppliers on time they almost completely stopped all our\n      shipments. This has resulted in tremendous financial loss to us. We\n      have lost our long hard earned reputation in the market by\n      becoming defaulters. The insurers have deliberately starved our\n      unit of funds to ruin us financially.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      You will appreciate that we are now faced with a situation where\n      we have no choice but to accept the payment being released to us\n      unconditionally as the insurers have made it very clear that the\n      payment will not be released if there is any conditional discharge\n      of the vouchers. In order to safeguard our right to claim the\n      difference amount and any other claims arising out of the financial\n      losses incurred by us a direct result of the deliberate delay in\n      settlement of our claim by the insurers, we make a humble request\n      to the I.R.D.A. to take up the matter with the insurers to ensure that\n      justice prevails and we are paid the entire compensation due to us.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">6.    The respondent also issued a legal notice dated 27.5.2006\n\nwherein it was alleged that the amount due by the insurer was\n\nRs.3,18,26,025/-, and that under duress and implicit coercion, it had\n\naccepted the payment of Rs.2,33,94,964/-, by signing and handing\n\nover a `full and final discharge voucher&#x27;. By the said notice, the\n\nrespondent demanded the difference amount with interest at the rate\n\nof 12% per annum from 6.12.2004 (date of final survey report) till the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                     7</span>\n\n\ndate of payment. The respondent also informed the appellant that if\n\npayment was not so made within 15 days, the notice should be treated\n\nas notice invoking arbitration. The appellant by its reply dated\n\n2.8.2006, rejected the said demand. The appellant contended that the\n\nrespondent had unconditionally accepted the claim settlement amount\n\nfully and finally; that respondent had not registered any protest while\n\naccepting the claim cheque; that the amount payable was arrived at\n\namicably after discussing all aspects of the claim with the insured and\n\nat no juncture any protest was expressed; and that therefore the\n\nquestion of invoking the provision for arbitration did not arise.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">7.    In view of appellant&#x27;s refusal to agree for arbitration, the\n\nrespondent filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_1\">section 11</a> of the Arbitration &amp;\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 (`Act&#x27; for short) in the Bombay High Court.\n\nThe said petition was resisted by the appellant by reiterating that the\n\nrespondent had accepted the payment of Rs.233,94,964/- in full and\n\nfinal settlement and therefore, the respondent could not invoke the\n\narbitration clause.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                     8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">8.    The learned Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court exercising\n\npower under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_2\">section 11</a> of the Act, allowed the petition by order dated\n\n19.4.2007. After considering the facts, he was of the view that there\n\nwas a serious dispute between the parties as to whether `discharge\n\nvoucher&#x27; was given voluntarily or under pressure or coercion, and\n\nthat required to be settled by the Arbitral Tribunal. He therefore\n\nappointed Sri Justice S.N.Variava as the sole arbitrator. The learned\n\nChief Justice left open the question whether there was any\n\ncoercion/undue influence in regard to issue of full and final\n\nsettlement discharge voucher by the respondent, and permitted the\n\nparties to lead evidence before the arbitrator on that question. The\n\nsaid order is challenged by the insurer in this appeal by special leave.\n\n\n\nThe rival contentions :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">9.    Learned counsel for the appellant contended that once the\n\ninsurance claim was settled and the insured received payment and\n\nissued a full and final discharge voucher, there was discharge of the\n\ncontract by accord and satisfaction. As a result, neither the contract\n\nnor any claim survived. It is submitted that when a discharge voucher\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                     9</span>\n\n\nwas issued by the respondent, acknowledging receipt of the amount\n\npaid by the appellant, in full and final settlement and confirming that\n\nthere are no pending claims against the appellant, such discharge\n\nvoucher should be accepted on its face value as a discharge of\n\ncontract by full and final settlement. Consequently, it should entail\n\nipso jure, rejection in limine of any subsequent claim or any request\n\nfor reference of any dispute regarding any claim to arbitration. It was\n\nalso contended that having received the payment under the said\n\ndischarge voucher, the respondent cannot, while retaining and\n\nenjoying the benefit of the full and final payment, challenge the\n\nvalidity or correctness of the discharge voucher. The appellant\n\ncontends that the subsequent claim of the respondent ought not to\n\nhave         been referred to arbitration. In support of its contentions,\n\nreliance was placed on three decisions of this Court in State of\n\nMaharashtra v. Nav Bharat Builders [1994 Supp (3) SCC 83], M/s.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"209845\" id=\"span_9\"><a href=\"/doc/209845/\" id=\"a_3\">P.

On the other hand the respondent contended that the scope of\n\nproceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_4\">section 11</a> of the Act was limited. It is submitted\n\nthat once the petitioner establishes that the contract between the\n\nparties contains an arbitration agreement, and that the dispute raised\n\nis in respect of a claim arising out of such contract, the dispute has to\n\nbe referred to arbitration; that any contention by the appellant\n\nthat there is discharge of the contract by issue of full and final\n\ndischarge voucher is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to examine and\n\ndecide, and cannot be held out as a threshold bar to arbitration; and\n\nthat the question whether there was accord and satisfaction, or\n\nwhether there was discharge of a contract by performance, is itself a\n\nquestion that is clearly arbitrable. It is alternatively submitted that\n\nwhen the Chief Justice or his designate is required to consider\n\nwhether the claimant has issued a full and final discharge voucher in\n\nsettlement of all claims, any objection to the validity of such\n\ndischarge voucher should also be considered. It is pointed out that\n\nwhere the discharge voucher is given under threat or coercion,\n\nresulting in economic duress and compulsion, such discharge voucher\n\nis not valid nor binding on the claimant, and the dispute relating to\n\nthe claim survives for consideration and is arbitrable. According to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                    11</span>\n\n\nrespondent, where the person on whom the claim is made, withholds\n\nthe admitted amount to coerce and compel the claimant to accept a\n\nsmaller payment in full and final settlement and give a discharge\n\nvoucher, there is no accord and satisfaction in the eye of law; and the\n\ndischarge voucher will not come in the way of a genuine and bona\n\nfide dispute being raised regarding the balance of the claim and\n\nseeking reference of such claim to arbitration. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"318552\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1579938\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1545494\" id=\"span_14\">In support of the said\n\ncontentions, reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1545494/\" id=\"a_5\">Damodar Valley Corporation v.

In reply, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that\n\nthe decisions relied on by the respondent were all rendered by two-\n\nJudge Benches of this Court, whereas the decision in Nathani Steels\n\nrelied on by the appellant, was rendered by a three-Judge Bench; and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                      12</span>\n\n\ntherefore the principle <a href=\"/doc/318552/\" id=\"a_8\">laid down in</a> Nathani Steels that there can be\n\nno reference to arbitration wherever there is a full and final\n\nsettlement, resulting in the discharge of the contract, holds the field\n\nand will have to be followed in preference to the other decisions.\n\n\n\nThe questions for consideration :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">12.    In this case existence of an arbitration clause in the contract of\n\ninsurance is not in dispute.

[1960 (1) SCR\n\n493], this Court considered the question whether the arbitration\n\nclause in the contract will cease to have effect, when the contract\n\nstood discharged as a result of settlement. While answering the\n\nquestion in the affirmative, a three Judge Bench of this Court culled\n\nout the following general principles as to when arbitration agreements\n\noperate and when they do not operate:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(i)    An arbitration clause is a collateral term of a contract\ndistinguished from its substantive terms; but none the less it is an\nintegral part of it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(ii) Howsoever comprehensive the terms of an arbitration clause\nmay be, the existence of the contract is a necessary condition for its\noperation; and the arbitration clause perishes with the contract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(iii) A contract may be non est in the sense that it never came\nlegally into existence or it was void ab initio.

The questions of unilateral repudiation of the rights\n      and obligations under the contract or of a full and final settlement\n      of the contract relate to the performance or discharge of the\n      contract. Far from putting an end to the arbitration clause, they fall\n      within the purview of it. A repudiation by one party alone does not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                            15</span>\n\n      terminate the contract. It takes two to end it, and hence it follows\n      that as the contract subsists for the determination of the rights and\n      obligations of the parties, the arbitration clause also survives. This\n      is not a case where the plea is that the contract is void, illegal or\n      fraudulent etc., in which case, the entire contract along with the\n      arbitration clause is non est, or voidable. As the contract is an\n      outcome of the agreement between the parties it is equally open to\n      the parties thereto to agree to bring it to an end or to treat it us if it\n      never existed. It may also be open to the parties to terminate the\n      previous contract and substitute in its place a new contract or alter\n      the original contract in such a way that it cannot subsist. In all\n      these cases, since the entire contract is put an end to the arbitration\n      clause, which is a part of it, also perishes along with it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">15.   <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 16</a> of the Act bestows upon the arbitral tribunal, the\n\ncompetence to rule on its own jurisdiction.

It was of\n\nthe view that sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">section 11</a> of the new\n\nAct, combined the power vested in the court under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_22\">sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/385194/\" id=\"a_23\">20</a>\n\nof the old <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_24\">Act (Arbitration Act, 1940</a>). This Court held :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      &quot;It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice,\n      approached with an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 11</a> of the Act, is to\n      decide at that stage. Obviously, he has to decide his own\n      jurisdiction in the sense, whether the party making the motion has\n      approached the right High Court. He has to decide whether there is\n      an arbitration agreement, as defined in the Act and whether the\n      person who has made the request before him, is a party to such an\n      agreement. It is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the\n      question whether the claim was a dead one; or a long barred\n      claim that was sought to be resurrected and whether the parties\n      have concluded the transaction by recording satisfaction of their\n      mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final payment\n      without objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to decide\n      whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the purview\n      of the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to leave that\n      question to be decided by the arbitral tribunal on taking evidence,\n      along with the merits of the claims involved in the arbitration. The\n      Chief Justice has to decide whether the applicant has satisfied the\n      conditions for appointing an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\n      Act. For the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the\n      Chief Justice can either proceed on the basis of affidavits and the\n      documents produced or take such evidence or get such evidence\n      recorded, as may be necessary. We think that adoption of this\n      procedure in the context of the Act would best serve the purpose\n      sought to be achieved by the Act of expediting the process of\n      arbitration, without too many approaches to the court at various\n      stages of the proceedings before the Arbitral tribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      &quot;47.(iv) The Chief Justice or the designated judge will have the\n      right to decide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier\n      part of this judgment. These will be, his own jurisdiction, to\n      entertain the request, the existence of a valid arbitration agreement,\n      the existence or otherwise of a live claim, the existence of the\n      condition for the exercise of his power and on the qualifications of\n      the arbitrator or arbitrators.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                         17</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThis Court also examined the `competence&#x27; of the arbitral tribunal to\n\nrule upon its own jurisdiction and about the existence of the\n\narbitration clause, when the Chief Justice or his designate had\n\nappointed the Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_27\">section 11</a> of the Act, after\n\ndeciding upon such jurisdictional issue. This Court held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      &quot;We are inclined to the view that the decision of the Chief Justice\n      on the issue of jurisdiction and the existence of a valid arbitration\n      agreement would be binding on the parties when the matter goes to\n      the arbitral tribunal&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">      &quot;<a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 16</a> is said to be the recognition of the principle of\n      Kompetenz - Kompetenz. The fact that the arbitral tribunal has the\n      competence to rule on its own jurisdiction and to define the\n      contours of its jurisdiction, only means that when such issues arise\n      before it, the Tribunal can and possibly, ought to decide them. This\n      can happen when the parties have gone to the arbitral tribunal\n      without recourse to <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8</a> or 11 of the Act. But where the\n      jurisdictional issues are decided under these Sections, before a\n      reference is made, <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 16</a> cannot be held to empower the\n      arbitral tribunal to ignore the decision given by the judicial\n      authority or the Chief Justice before the reference to it was made.\n      The competence to decide does not enable the arbitral tribunal to\n      get over the finality conferred on an order passed prior to its\n      entering upon the reference by the very statute that creates it. That\n      is the position arising out of <a href=\"/doc/1181933/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 11(7)</a> of the Act read with\n      <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 16</a> thereof. The finality given to the order of the Chief\n      Justice on the matters within his competence under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 11</a> of\n      the Act, are incapable of being reopened before the arbitral\n      tribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">16.   It is thus clear that when a contract contains an arbitration\n\nclause and any dispute in respect of the said contract is referred to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                     18</span>\n\n\narbitration without the intervention of the court, the Arbitral Tribunal\n\ncan decide the following questions affecting its jurisdiction: (a)\n\nwhether there is an arbitration agreement; (b) whether the arbitration\n\nagreement is valid; (c) whether the contract in which the arbitration\n\nclause is found is null and void and if so whether the invalidity\n\nextends to the Arbitration clause also. It follows therefore that if the\n\nrespondent before the Arbitral Tribunal contends that the contract has\n\nbeen discharged by reason of the claimant accepting payment made\n\nby the respondent in full and final settlement, and if the claimant\n\ncounters it by contending that the discharge voucher was extracted\n\nfrom him by practicing fraud, undue influence, or coercion, the\n\narbitral tribunal will have to decide whether the discharge of contract\n\nwas vitiated by any circumstance which rendered the discharge\n\nvoidable at the instance of the claimant. If the arbitral tribunal comes\n\nto the conclusion that there was a valid discharge by voluntary\n\nexecution of a discharge voucher, it will refuse to examine the claim\n\non merits, and reject the claim as not maintainable. On the other hand,\n\nif the arbitral tribunal comes to the conclusion that such discharge of\n\ncontract was vitiated by any circumstance which rendered it void, it\n\nwill ignore the same and proceed to decide the claim on merits.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                     19</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">17.

Alternatively, he may leave those issues open with a\n\ndirection to the Arbitral Tribunal to decide the same. If the Chief\n\nJustice of his Designate chooses to examine the issue and decides it,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal cannot re-examine the same issue. The Chief\n\nJustice/his designate will, in choosing whether he will decide such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                     21</span>\n\n\nissue or leave it to the Arbitral Tribunal, be guided by the object of\n\nthe Act (that is expediting the arbitration process with minimum\n\njudicial intervention). Where allegations of forgery/fabrication are\n\nmade in regard to the document recording discharge of contract by\n\nfull and final settlement, it would be appropriate if the Chief\n\nJustice/his designate decides the issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">18.   What is however clear is when a respondent contends that the\n\ndispute is not arbitrable on account of discharge of the contract under\n\na settlement agreement or discharge voucher or no-claim certificate,\n\nand the claimant contends that it was obtained by fraud, coercion or\n\nunder influence, the issue will have to be decided either by the Chief\n\nJustice/his designate in the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_36\">section 11</a> of the Act or\n\nby the arbitral Tribunal as directed by the order under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_37\">section 11</a> of\n\nthe Act. A claim for arbitration cannot be rejected merely or solely\n\non the ground that a settlement agreement or discharge voucher had\n\nbeen executed by the claimant, if its validity is disputed by the\n\nclaimant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">19.   We may next examine some related and incidental issues.\n\nFirstly, we may refer to the consequences of discharge of a contract.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                    22</span>\n\n\nWhen a contract has been fully performed, there is a discharge of the\n\ncontract by performance, and the contract comes to an end. In regard\n\nto such a discharged contract, nothing remains - neither any right to\n\nseek performance nor any obligation to perform. In short, there\n\ncannot be any dispute. Consequently, there cannot obviously be\n\nreference to arbitration of any dispute arising from a discharged\n\ncontract. Whether the contract has been discharged by performance or\n\nnot is a mixed question of fact and law, and if there is a dispute in\n\nregard to that question, that is arbitrable. But there is an exception.\n\nWhere both parties to a contract confirm in writing that the contract\n\nhas been fully and finally discharged by performance of all\n\nobligations and there are no outstanding claims or disputes, courts\n\nwill not refer any subsequent claim or dispute to arbitration.\n\nSimilarly, where one of the parties to the contract issues a full and\n\nfinal discharge voucher (or no due certificate as the case may be)\n\nconfirming that he has received the payment in full and final\n\nsatisfaction of all claims, and he has no outstanding claim, that\n\namounts to discharge of the contract by acceptance of performance\n\nand the party issuing the discharge voucher/certificate cannot\n\nthereafter make any fresh claim or revive any settled claim. Nor can\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                    23</span>\n\n\nhe seek reference to arbitration in respect of any claim. When we\n\nrefer to a discharge of contract by an agreement signed by both\n\nparties or by execution of a full and final discharge voucher/receipt\n\nby one of the parties, we refer to an agreement or discharge voucher\n\nwhich is validly and voluntarily executed. If the party who has\n\nexecuted the discharge agreement or discharge voucher, alleges that\n\nthe execution of such discharge agreement or voucher was on account\n\nof fraud/coercion/undue influence practiced by the other party and is\n\nable to establish the same, then obviously the discharge of the\n\ncontract by such agreement/voucher is rendered void and cannot be\n\nacted upon. Consequently, any dispute raised by such party would be\n\narbitrable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">20.   While discharge of contract by performance refers to\n\nfulfillment of the contract by performance of all the obligations in\n\nterms of the original contract, discharge by `accord and satisfaction&#x27;\n\nrefers to the contract being discharged by reason of performance of\n\ncertain substituted obligations. The agreement by which the original\n\nobligation is discharged is the accord, and the discharge of the\n\nsubstituted obligation is the satisfaction.     A contract can be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                           24</span>\n\n\ndischarged by the same process which created it, that is by mutual\n\nagreement. A contract may be discharged by the parties to the original\n\ncontract either by entering into a new contract in substitution of the\n\noriginal contract; or by acceptance of performance of modified\n\nobligations in lieu of the obligations stipulated in the contract. The\n\nclassic definition of the term `accord and satisfaction&#x27; given by the\n\nPrivy Council        in Payana Reena Saminathan vs. Pana Lana\n\nPalaniappa - 41 IA 142 (reiterated in Kishorilal Gupta) is as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      &quot;The `receipt&#x27; given by the appellants and accepted by the\n      respondent, and acted on by both parties proves conclusively that\n      all the parties agreed to a settlement of all their existing disputes by\n      the arrangement formulated in the `receipt&#x27;. It is a clear example of\n      what used to be well known as common law pleading as `accord\n      and satisfaction by a substituted agreement&#x27;. No matter what were\n      the respective rights of the parties inter se they are abandoned in\n      consideration of the acceptance by all of a new agreement. The\n      consequence is that when such an accord and satisfaction takes\n      place the prior rights of the parties are extinguished. They have in\n      fact been exchanged for the new rights; and the new agreement\n      becomes a new departure, and the rights of all the parties are fully\n      represented by it.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                                                        [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">21.   It is thus clear that the arbitration agreement contained in a\n\ncontract cannot be invoked to seek reference of any dispute to\n\narbitration, in the following circumstances, when the contract is\n\ndischarged on account of performance, or accord and satisfaction, or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                        25</span>\n\n\nmutual agreement, and the same is reduced to writing (and signed by\n\nboth parties or by the party seeking arbitration) :\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(a) Where the obligations under a contract are fully performed and\n      discharge of the contract by performance is acknowledged by a\n      full and final discharge voucher/receipt.

On an application by\n\nthe contractor, under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_38\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> for appointment of an\n\nArbitrator, the Civil Court appointed an Arbitrator. The said order of\n\nappointment was challenged by the employer. The High Court found\n\nthat the contractor had unconditionally acknowledged the final\n\nmeasurement and accepted the payment in full and final settlement of\n\nthe contract on 19.5.1981; that thereafter he had made a fresh claim\n\non 1.6.1981 which was rejected on 12.8.1981; and that the contractor\n\ndid not take action and sought reference to arbitration only several\n\nyears thereafter. The High Court therefore held that there was no\n\nsubsisting   contract   to   enable   reference   to   arbitration   and\n\nconsequently, set aside the reference to arbitration. On appeal by the\n\ncontractor, this Court held that in view of the finding recorded by the\n\nHigh Court that the contractor had accepted the measurements and\n\npayment and had unconditionally acknowledged full and final\n\nsettlement and satisfaction by issuing a receipt in writing, no\n\narbitrable dispute arose for being referred to Arbitration. This Court\n\nfurther held that there was accord and satisfaction by final settlement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                     27</span>\n\n\nof the claims and the subsequent allegation of coercion was an\n\nafterthought and only a ploy to get over the settlement of the dispute.\n\n\n\n22.2) In Nav Bharat Builders, a dispute arose in regard to labour\n\nescalation charges. As the employer did not agree for escalation, the\n\ncontractor made an application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_39\">section 20</a> of the Arbitration\n\nAct, 1940 for filing the agreement and for reference of the dispute to\n\narbitration. Pending the said application, the contractor made a\n\nrepresentation to the employer for settlement of the claim. The\n\ngovernment constituted a Committee to examine the labour\n\nescalation. The said Committee suggested acceptance of the claim\n\nsubject to certain terms. The contractor by his letter dated 3.3.1989\n\nagreed to receive the price escalation on account of the labour\n\ncomponent, as worked out by the Committee. Thereafter, the\n\nrecommended amount was paid to the contractor, who accepted the\n\npayment and agreed to withdraw the application under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_40\">section 20</a> in\n\nregard to the claim for labour escalation. He subsequently contended\n\nthat the said letter was obtained by coercion and he was not bound by\n\nit. The trial court and the High Court held that there was an arbitrable\n\ndispute which was challenged before this Court. It is in this\n\nbackground this Court following P. K. Ramaiah held :\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                            28</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">      &quot;............the respondent contended that the appellant had\n      accepted the principle on which the escalation charges are to be\n      paid but in its working the amount was not calculated correctly and\n      he expressly referred the same in his letter of acceptance and that,\n      therefore, it is open to the respondent to contend before the\n      arbitrator that in working the principle on which the amount\n      offered by the Government the arbitrator has to decide as to what\n      amount had been arrived at and if the working in principle is not\n      acceptable any alternative principle would be applicable. If the\n      arbitrator finds that the respondent is entitled to any claim, it is still\n      an arbitrable dispute. We find no substance in the contention.\n      Whatever be the principle or method or manner of working it out,\n      a particular figure was arrived at by the Government. The\n      respondent was then asked to consider its willingness to accept the\n      offer and having accepted the same and received the amount, it is\n      no longer open to the respondent to dispute the claim on any count\n      or ground. The dispute was concluded and the respondent fully\n      and finally accepted the (settlement of the) claim and thereafter\n      received the amount. Thus there is accord and satisfaction of the\n      claim relating to labour escalation charges. Thereby there is no\n      further arbitrable dispute in that behalf.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">                                                        [emphasis supplied]\n\n\n\n\n22.3) Nathani Steels related to a dispute on account of non-\n\ncompletion of the contract. The Court found that the said dispute was\n\nsettled by and between the parties as per deed dated 20.12.1980\n\nsigned by both parties. The deed referred to the prior discussions\n\nbetween the parties and recorded the amicable settlement of the\n\ndisputes and differences between the parties in the presence of the\n\nArchitect on the terms and conditions set out in clauses 1 to 8 thereof.\n\nIn view of it, the Court rejected the contention of the contractor that\n\nthe settlement was liable to be set aside on the ground of mistake. A\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                         29</span>\n\n\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court, after referring to the decisions in P.\n\nK. Ramaiah and Nav Bharat Builders, held thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">      &quot;....that once the parties have arrived at a settlement in respect of\n      any dispute or difference arising under a contract and that dispute\n      or the difference is amicable settled by way of a final settlement by\n      and between the parties, unless that settlement is set aside in\n      proper proceedings, it cannot lie in the mouth of one of the parties\n      to the settlement to spurn it on the ground that it was a mistake and\n      proceed to invoke the Arbitration clause. If this is permitted the\n      sanctity of contract, the settlement also being a contract, would be\n      wholly lost and it would be open to one party to take the benefit\n      under the settlement and then to question the same on the ground\n      of mistake without having the settlement set aside. In the\n      circumstances, we think that in the instant case since the dispute or\n      difference was finally settled and payments were made as per the\n      settlement, it was not open to the respondent unilaterally to treat\n      the settlement as non est and proceed to invoke the Arbitration\n      clause.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">                                                       [emphasis supplied]\n\n\n\n\n22.4) What requires to be noticed is that in Nav Bharat Builders and\n\nNathani Steels, this court on examination of facts, was satisfied that\n\nthere were negotiations and voluntary settlement of all pending\n\ndisputes, and the contract was discharged by accord and satisfaction.\n\nIn P. K. Ramaiah, the Court was satisfied that there was a voluntary\n\nacceptance of the measurements and full and final payment of the\n\namount found due, resulting in discharge of the contract, leaving no\n\noutstanding claim or pending dispute. In those circumstances, this\n\nCourt held that after such voluntary accord and satisfaction or\n\ndischarge of the contract, there could be no arbitrable disputes.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                          30</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">23.   We may next refer to the decisions relied on by the respondent:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">23.1) In Damodar Valley Corporation, the question that arose for\n\nconsideration of this Court was as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      &quot;where one of the parties refers a dispute or disputes to arbitration\n      and the other party takes a plea that there was a final settlement of\n      all claims, is the Court, on an application under <a href=\"/doc/371235/\" id=\"a_41\">Sections 9(b)</a> and\n      <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_42\">33</a> of the Act, entitled to enquire into the truth and validity of the\n      averment as to whether there was or was not a final settlement on\n      the ground that if that was proved it would bar a reference to the\n      arbitration inasmuch as the arbitration clause itself would perish.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">In that case the question arose with reference to a claim by the\n\nsupplier. The purchaser required the supplier to furnish a full and\n\nfinal receipt. But the supplier did not give such a receipt. Even though\n\nthere was no discharge voucher, the purchaser contended that the\n\npayments made by it were in full and final settlement of the bills. This\n\nCourt rejected that contention and held that the question whether\n\nthere has been a settlement of all the claims arising in connection\n\nwith the contract also postulates the existence of the contract which\n\nwould mean that the arbitration clause operates. This Court held that\n\nthe question whether there has been a full and final settlement of a\n\nclaim under the contract is itself a dispute arising `upon&#x27; or `in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                     31</span>\n\n\nrelation to&#x27; or `in connection with&#x27; the contract; and where there is an\n\narbitration clause in a contract, notwithstanding the plea that there\n\nwas a full and final settlement between the parties, that dispute can be\n\nreferred to arbitration. It was also observed that mere claim of accord\n\nand satisfaction may not put an end to the arbitration clause. It is\n\nsignificant that neither P.K. Ramaiah nor Nathani Steels disagreed\n\nwith the decision in Damodar Valley Corporation but only\n\ndistinguished it on the ground that there was no full and final\n\ndischarge voucher showing accord and satisfaction in that case.\n\n\n\n23.2) In Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., this Court observed that the\n\nquestion whether there was discharge of the contract by accord and\n\nsatisfaction or not, is a dispute arising out of the contract, which\n\nrequires to be referred to arbitration. It was held that the Arbitrator\n\nshall first determine whether there was accord and satisfaction\n\nbetween parties and/or whether the contract was discharged; that if\n\nthe decision was in favour of the employer, the Arbitrator will not\n\nproceed further in the matter but dismiss the claim of the contractor;\n\nand that if he finds that the contract was not discharged by accord and\n\nsatisfaction or otherwise, he should proceed to determine the claim of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                           32</span>\n\n\nthe contractor on merits. In this case also, there was no\n\nacknowledgment of full and final settlement not any discharge\n\nvoucher.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"864798\" id=\"span_40\">23.3) In <a href=\"/doc/864798/\" id=\"a_43\">Union of India vs. L.K. Ahuja &amp; Co.</a> - 1988 (3) SCC 76,\n\nthis Court observed :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       &quot;In order to be entitled to ask for a reference under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_44\">section 20</a> of\n       the Act, there must be an entitlement to money and a difference or\n       dispute in respect of the same. It is true that on completion of the\n       work, right to get payment would normally arise and it is also true\n       that on settlement of the final bill, the right to get further payment\n       gets weakened but the claim subsists and whether it does subsist, is\n       a matter which is arbitrable.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"864798\" id=\"span_41\">There was no full and final discharge or accord and satisfaction <a href=\"/doc/864798/\" id=\"a_45\">in\n\nthat   case</a>.    In    Jayesh     Engineering       Works,      There     was    an\n\nacknowledgment by the contractor that he had received the amount in\n\nfull and final settlement and he has no further claim. This Court\n\nfollowing L. K. Ahuja held that whether the contract has been fully\n\nworked out and whether the payments have been made in full and\n\nfinal settlement are questions to be considered by the arbitrator when\n\nthere is a dispute regarding the validity of such acknowledgement and\n\nthat the arbitrator will consider whether any amount is due to be paid\n\nand how far the claim made by the contractor is tenable. Jayesh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                           33</span>\n\n\nEngineering Works did not refer to Kishorilal Gupta, Nav Bharat\n\nBuilders, P.K. Ramaiah or Nathani Steels..</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n23.4) In Reshmi Constructions, the employer prepared a final bill\n\nand forwarded the same along with a `No-Demand Certificate&#x27; in\n\nprinted format confirming that it had no claims. The contractor signed\n\nthe no-demand certificate and submitted it. But on the same day, the\n\ncontractor also wrote a letter to the employer stating that it had issued\n\nthe said certificate in view of a threat that until the said document was\n\nexecuted, payment of the bill will not be released. In those\n\ncircumstances, after considering P. K. Ramaiah and Nathani Steels,\n\nthis Court held :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      &quot;26. ... The conduct of the parties as evidenced in their letters, as\n      noticed hereinbefore, clearly goes to show that not only the final\n      bill submitted by the respondent was rejected but another final bill\n      was prepared with a printed format that a &quot;No-Demand Certificate&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">      has been executed as otherwise the final bill would not be paid.\n      The respondent herein, as noticed hereinbefore, categorically stated\n      in its letter dated 20.12.1990 as to under what circumstances they\n      were compelled to sign the said printed letter. It appears from the\n      appendix appended to the judgment of the learned trial Judge that\n      the said letter was filed even before the trial court. It is, therefore,\n      not a case whether the respondent&#x27;s assertion of &quot;under influence\n      or coercion&quot; can be said to have been taken by way of an\n      afterthought.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">      27. Even when rights and obligations of the parties are worked out,\n      the contract does not come to an end inter alia for the purpose of\n      determination of the disputes arising thereunder, and, thus, the\n      arbitration agreement can be invoked. Although it may not be\n      strictly in place but we cannot shut our eyes to the ground reality\n      that in a case where a contractor has made huge investments, he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                          34</span>\n\n      cannot afford not to take from the employer the amount under the\n      bills, for various reasons which may include discharge of his\n      liability towards the banks, financial institutions and other persons.\n      In such a situation, the public sector undertakings would have an\n      upper hand. They would not ordinarily release the money unless a\n      &quot;No-Demand Certificate&quot; is signed. Each case, therefore, is\n      required to be considered on its own facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">      28. Further, necessitas non habet legem is an age-old maxim which\n      means necessity knows no law. A person may sometimes have to\n      succumb to the pressure of the other party to the bargain who is in\n      a stronger position.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">      29. We may, however, hasten to add that such a case has to be\n      made out and proved before the arbitrator for obtaining an award.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nThis decision dealt with a case where there was some justification for\n\nthe contention of the contractor that the `No-demand Certificate&#x27; was\n\nnot given voluntarily but under coercion, and on facts, this Court felt\n\nthat the question required to be examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n23.5) In Ambica Constructions (supra) this Court considered a clause\n\nin the contract which required the contractor to give a no claim\n\ncertificate in the form required by Railways after the final\n\nmeasurement is taken and provided that the contractor shall be\n\ndebarred from disputing the correctness of the items covered by `No\n\nclaim certificate&#x27; or demanding a reference to arbitration in respect\n\nthereof. There was some material to show that the certificate was\n\ngiven under coercion and duress. This Court following Reshmi\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                                     35</span>\n\n\nConstructions, observed that such a clause in contract would not be\n\nan absolute bar to a contractor raising claims which were genuine,\n\neven after submission of a no-claim certificate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">24.   We thus find that the cases referred fall under two categories.\n\nThe cases relied on by the appellant are of one category where the\n\ncourt after considering the facts, found that there was a full and final\n\nsettlement resulting in accord and satisfaction, and there was no\n\nsubstance in the allegations        of coercion/ undue influence.\n\nConsequently, this Court held that there could be no reference of any\n\ndispute to arbitration. The decisions in Nav Bharat and Nathani\n\nSteels are cases falling under this category where there were bilateral\n\nnegotiated settlements of pending disputes, such settlements having\n\nbeen reduced to writing either in the presence of witnesses or\n\notherwise. P.K. Ramaiah is a case where the contract was performed\n\nand there was a full and final settlement and satisfaction resulting in\n\ndischarge of the contract. It also falls under this category. The cases\n\nrelied on by the respondent fall under a different category where the\n\ncourt found some substance in the contention of the claimants that `no\n\ndue/claim certificates&#x27;, or `full and final settlement Discharge\n\nVouchers&#x27; were insisted and taken (either in a printed format or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                     36</span>\n\n\notherwise) as a condition precedent for release of the admitted dues.\n\nAlternatively, they were cases where full and final discharge was\n\nalleged, but there were no documents confirming such discharge.\n\nConsequently, this Court held that the disputes were arbitrable. None\n\nof the three cases relied on by the appellant lay down a proposition\n\nthat mere execution of a full and final settlement receipt or a\n\ndischarge voucher is a bar to arbitration, even when the validity\n\nthereof is challenged by the claimant on the ground of fraud, coercion\n\nor undue influence. Nor do they lay down a proposition that even if\n\nthe discharge of contract is not genuine or legal, the claims cannot be\n\nreferred to arbitration. In all the three cases, the court examined the\n\nfacts and satisfied itself that there was accord and satisfaction or\n\ncomplete discharge of the contract and that there was no evidence to\n\nsupport the allegation of coercion/undue influence. It is true that in\n\nNathani Steels, there is an observation that &quot;unless that settlement is\n\nset aside in proper proceedings, it cannot lie in the mouth of one of\n\nthe parties to the settlement to spurn it on the ground that it was a\n\nmistake and proceed to invoke the arbitration clause&quot;. But that was an\n\nobservation made with reference to a plea of `mistake&#x27; and not with\n\nreference to allegation of fraud, undue influence or coercion. It is also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                                       37</span>\n\n\ntrue that the observations in Damodar Valley Corporation and Jayesh\n\nEngineering Works, that whether contract has been fully worked out\n\nand whether payment has been made in full and final settlement are\n\nquestions to be considered by the Arbitrator when there is a dispute\n\nregarding the same, even if there is a full and final settlement\n\ndischarge voucher, seem to reflect a view at the other end of the\n\nspectrum. Though it is possible to read them harmoniously, such an\n\nexercise may not be necessary. All those decisions were rendered in\n\nthe context of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_46\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a>. The\n\nperspective of the new Act is different from the old Act.

If in a given\n      case the consumer satisfies the authority under the Act that the\n      discharge voucher was obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, undue\n      influence or the like, coercive bargaining compelled by\n      circumstances, the authority before whom the complaint is made\n      would be justified in granting appropriate relief.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      In the instant cases the discharge vouchers were admittedly\n      executed voluntarily and the complainants had not alleged their\n      execution under fraud, undue influence, misrepresentation or the\n      like.

It is\n      difficult to give an exhaustive list of all bargains of this type. No\n      court can visualize the different situations which can arise in the\n      affairs of men. One can only attempt to give some illustrations. For\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                         39</span>\n\n      instance, the above principle will apply where the inequality of\n      bargaining power is the result of the great disparity in the economic\n      strength of the contracting parties. It will apply where the\n      inequality is the result of circumstances, whether of the creation of\n      the parties or not. It will apply to situations in which the weaker\n      party is in a position in which he can obtain goods or services or\n      means of livelihood only upon the terms imposed by the stronger\n      party or go without them. It will also apply where a man has no\n      choice, or rather no meaningful choice, but to give his assent to a\n      contract or to sign on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard\n      form or to accept a set of rules as part of the contract, however\n      unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a clause in that contract\n      or form or rules may be. This principle, however, will not apply\n      where the bargaining power of the contracting parties is equal or\n      almost equal.

These\n      cases can neither be enumerated nor fully illustrated. The court\n      must judge each case on its own facts and circumstances.&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">                                                     [emphasis supplied]\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">26.   Obtaining of undated receipts-in-advance in regard to\n\nregular/routine payments by government departments and corporate\n\nsector is an accepted practice which has come to stay due to\n\nadministrative exigencies and accounting necessities. The reason for\n\ninsisting upon undated voucher/receipt is that as on the date of\n\nexecution of such voucher/receipt, payment is not made. The payment\n\nis made only on a future date long after obtaining the receipt. If the\n\ndate of execution of the receipt is mentioned in the receipt and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                     40</span>\n\n\npayment is released long thereafter, the receipt acknowledging the\n\namount as having been received on a much earlier date will be absurd\n\nand meaningless. Therefore, undated receipts are taken so that it can\n\nbe used in respect of subsequent payments by incorporating the\n\nappropriate date. But many a time, matters are dealt with so casually,\n\nthat the date is not filled even when payment is made. Be that as it\n\nmay. But what is of some concern is the routine insistence by some\n\ngovernment Departments, statutory Corporations and government\n\nCompanies for issue of undated `no due certificates&#x27; or a `full and\n\nfinal settlements vouchers&#x27; acknowledging receipt of a sum which is\n\nsmaller than the claim in full and final settlement of all claims, as a\n\ncondition precedent for releasing even the admitted dues. Such a\n\nprocedure requiring the claimant to issue an undated receipt\n\n(acknowledging receipt of a sum smaller than his claim) in full and\n\nfinal settlement, as a condition for releasing an admitted lesser\n\namount, is unfair, irregular and illegal and requires to be deprecated.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">27.   Let us consider what a civil court would have done in a case\n\nwhere the defendant puts forth the defence of accord and satisfaction\n\non the basis of a full and final discharge voucher issued by plaintiff,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                     41</span>\n\n\nand the plaintiff alleges that it was obtained by fraud/coercion/undue\n\ninfluence and therefore not valid. It would consider the evidence as to\n\nwhether there was any fraud, coercion or undue influence. If it found\n\nthat there was none, it will accept the voucher as being in discharge\n\nof the contract and reject the claim without examining the claim on\n\nmerits. On the other hand, if it found that the discharge voucher had\n\nbeen obtained by fraud/undue influence/coercion, it will ignore the\n\nsame, examine whether plaintiff had made out the claim on merits and\n\ndecide the matter accordingly. The position will be the same even\n\nwhen there is a provision for arbitration. The Chief Justice/his\n\ndesignate exercising jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_50\">section 11</a> of the Act will\n\nconsider whether there was really accord and satisfaction or discharge\n\nof contract by performance. If the answer is in the affirmative, he will\n\nrefuse to refer the dispute to arbitration. On the other hand, if the\n\nChief Justice/his designate comes to the conclusion that the full and\n\nfinal settlement receipt or discharge voucher was the result of any\n\nfraud/coercion/undue influence, he will have to hold that there was no\n\ndischarge of the contract and consequently refer the dispute to\n\narbitration. Alternatively, where the Chief Justice/his designate is\n\nsatisfied prima facie that the discharge voucher was not issued\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                    42</span>\n\n\nvoluntarily and the claimant was under some compulsion or coercion,\n\nand that the matter deserved detailed consideration, he may instead of\n\ndeciding the issue himself, refer the matter to the arbitral tribunal\n\nwith a specific direction that the said question should be decided in\n\nthe first instance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">28.    Some illustrations (not exhaustive) as to when claims are\n\narbitrable and when they are not, when discharge of contract by\n\naccord and satisfaction are disputed, to round up the discussion on\n\nthis subject :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">(i)    A claim is referred to a conciliation or a pre-litigation Lok\nAdalat. The parties negotiate and arrive at a settlement. The terms of\nsettlement are drawn up and signed by both the parties and attested by\nthe Conciliator or the members of the Lok Adalat. After settlement by\nway of accord and satisfaction, there can be no reference to\narbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">(ii)   A claimant makes several claims. The admitted or undisputed\nclaims are paid. Thereafter negotiations are held for settlement of the\ndisputed claims resulting in an agreement in writing settling all the\npending claims and disputes. On such settlement, the amount agreed\nis paid and the contractor also issues a discharge voucher/no claim\ncertificate/full and final receipt. After the contract is discharged by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                      43</span>\n\n\nsuch accord and satisfaction, neither the contract nor any dispute\nsurvives for consideration. There cannot be any reference of any\ndispute to arbitration thereafter.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">(iii)   A contractor executes the work and claims payment of say\nRupees Ten Lakhs as due in terms of the contract. The employer\nadmits the claim only for Rupees six lakhs and informs the contractor\neither in writing or orally that unless the contractor gives a discharge\nvoucher in the prescribed format acknowledging receipt of Rupees\nSix Lakhs in full and final satisfaction of the contract, payment of the\nadmitted amount will not be released. The contractor who is hard\npressed for funds and keen to get the admitted amount released, signs\non the dotted line either in a printed form or otherwise, stating that\nthe amount is received in full and final settlement. In such a case, the\ndischarge is under economic duress on account of coercion employed\nby the employer. Obviously, the discharge voucher cannot be\nconsidered to be voluntary or as having resulted in discharge of the\ncontract by accord and satisfaction. It will not be a bar to arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">(iv)    An insured makes a claim for loss suffered. The claim is\nneither admitted nor rejected. But the insured is informed during\ndiscussions that unless the claimant gives a full and final voucher for\na specified amount (far lesser than the amount claimed by the\ninsured), the entire claim will be rejected. Being in financial\ndifficulties, the claimant agrees to the demand and issues an undated\ndischarge voucher in full and final settlement. Only a few days\nthereafter, the admitted amount mentioned in the voucher is paid. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                     44</span>\n\n\naccord and satisfaction in such a case is not voluntary but under\nduress, compulsion and coercion. The coercion is subtle, but very\nmuch real. The `accord&#x27; is not by free consent. The arbitration\nagreement can thus be invoked to refer the disputes to arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(v)   A claimant makes a claim for a huge sum, by way of damages.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\">The respondent disputes the claim. The claimant who is keen to have\na settlement and avoid litigation, voluntarily reduces the claim and\nrequests for settlement. The respondent agrees and settles the claim\nand obtains a full and final discharge voucher. Here even if the\nclaimant might have agreed for settlement due to financial\ncompulsions and commercial pressure or economic duress, the\ndecision was his free choice. There was no threat, coercion or\ncompulsion by the respondent. Therefore, the accord and satisfaction\nis binding and valid and there cannot be any subsequent claim or\nreference to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">29.   Let us now examine the receipt that has been taken in this case.\n\nIt is undated and is in a pro forma furnished by the appellant\n\ncontaining irrelevant and inappropriate statements. It states : &quot;I/we\n\nhereby assign to the company, my/our right to the affected property\n\nstolen which shall, in the event of their recovery, be the property of\n\nthe company&quot;. The claim was not in regard to theft of any property\n\nnor was the claim being settled in respect of a theft claim. We are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                      45</span>\n\n\nreferring to this aspect only to show how claimants are required to\n\nsign on the dotted line, and how such vouchers are insisted and taken\n\nmechanically without application of mind.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">30.   The discharge voucher form was handed over to the respondent\n\non 21.3.2006. It was signed and delivered to the appellant\n\nimmediately thereafter acknowledging that a sum of Rs.2,33,94,964/-\n\nhad been received from the insurer (appellant) in full and final\n\nsettlement, and that in consideration of such payment, the respondent\n\nabsolved the appellant from all liabilities, present and future, arising\n\ndirectly or indirectly, out of said loss or damage under the policy.\n\nAdmittedly, on the date when such discharge voucher was signed and\n\ngiven by the respondent, the payment of Rs.233,94,964/- had not been\n\nmade. It was made after receiving the voucher. Therefore, at the time\n\nof signing the voucher by the respondent and at the time of delivery\n\nof voucher by the respondent to the appellant, the contents of the\n\nvoucher that the said amount had been received, that such amount had\n\nbeen received in full and final settlement of all claims, and that in\n\nconsideration of such payment, the company was absolved from any\n\nfurther liability, are all false and not supported by consideration.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                      46</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">31.   In this case the High Court examined the issue and found that\n\nprima facie there was no accord and satisfaction or discharge of the\n\ncontract. It held that the appellant is still entitled to raise this issue\n\nbefore an arbitrator and the arbitrator has to decide it. On the facts\n\nand circumstances and the settled position of law referred by us\n\nabove, we are also prima facie of the view that there is no accord and\n\nsatisfaction in this case and the dispute is arbitrable. But it is still\n\nopen to the appellant to lead evidence before the arbitrator, to\n\nestablish that there is a valid and binding discharge of the contract by\n\nway of accord and satisfaction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">32.   We therefore find no reason to interfere with the order of the\n\nHigh court. The appeal is accordingly dismissed. We make it clear\n\nnothing stated by the High Court or by us shall be construed as\n\nexpression of any final opinion on the issue whether there was accord\n\nand satisfaction nor as expression of any views on merits of any claim\n\nor contentions of the parties.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n\n\n                                        ...............................J.\n                                        (R V Raveendran)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                      47</span>\n\n\n\n\nNew Delhi;             .............................J.\nSeptember 18, 2008.
