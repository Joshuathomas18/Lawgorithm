No.6777 of 2024 has been filed for\n\nvacation of the aforesaid interim order.

The total amount of the agreement value was\n\nRs.4,39,946,924.13.

As per the\n\nsaid contract, the Petitioner was to complete the work within 8\n\nmonths from the date of contract. But due to non-fulfillment of the\n\nreciprocal promises by JSPL in time, the work could not be\n\nexecuted as per the programme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">         There are provisions in the contract that the Management\n\nof JSPL is to supply free materials in time.

The\n\nManagement of JSPL, without any notice to the Petitioner,\n\nreduced the scope of work by 30-40 since March, 2023. It also did\n\nnot provide sufficient hutment and facilities for the workers as per\n\nterms of the contract in terms of the requirement of the Petitioner,\n\nfor which the work could not run in full swing.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">         Due to non-fulfillment of reciprocal promises made by the\n\nJSPL, by various letters, the Petitioner drew attention of JSPL in\n\nbetween 22.08.2022 to 20.02.2024 indicating therein as to not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.(C) No.11848 of 2024                                   Page 4 of 73</span>\n handing over a hindrance free site for excavation, non-payment of\n\nthe deviation quantity of excavation, rock strata found during\n\nexcavation, nonpayment of deviation quantity of excavation (not\n\nestimated at the time of contract allocation) leading to increase in\n\ncost and time, continuous delays in providing free issue materials\n\ni.e. Backfill material, TMT bars, concrete, structural materials, PS\n\nPanel, L-Mesh, u-Mesh, sand, cement, paint etc. labour hutment,\n\nfree electricity and water. Further there was various revision and\n\nrectification of drawings, delay in payment and non reconciliation\n\nof accounts and detail deduction sheets. Further the GST payment\n\nas per the contract was not released and unilaterally the work was\n\nreduced without any intimation or discussion, for which the\n\nPetitioner had deployed machinery, equipment, material and\n\nmanpower.

The bank guarantee can also be invoked if\n         the licensee is declared or applies for being declared\n         insolvent or bankrupt. There is no dispute that the\n         licensee did not commence its operations and therefore\n         the second condition does not apply. Admittedly, the\n         third condition is not applicable to the facts of the case.\n         According to the appellant, bank guarantee was invoked\n         due to failure on the part of the licensee to deposit the\n         licence fee within 7 days of beginning of the year.\n         Essentially, the bank guarantee given by the respondent\n         is a performance bank guarantee and was intended to\n         ensure the due performance of the licence agreement. A\n         perusal of the conditions of the relevant clauses of the\n         agreement clearly shows that according to <a href=\"/doc/1200881/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 1.1</a> of\n         Schedule &#x27;C&#x27; to the agreement, the licence was granted\n         for period of 10 years which has to be reckoned from the\n         date of issuance of WOL by the WPC. Admittedly, WOL\n         was never issued by WPC.

There were continued\n         delays in the provision of free-issue material to be\n         provided by JSPL as per contract, which includes, but is\n         not limited to, backfill material, TMT bars, concrete,\n         structural material, PS panel, L-mesh, U-mesh, sand,\n         cement, paint, etc.\n\n         Furthermore, as per the provisions of the contract, JSPL\n         was supposed to provide labour hutment, free\n         electricity, and water, which was not provided. Even\n         after repeated requests, the same was not provided as\n         per our requirement, which we have pointed out via\n         many letters and presentations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">         Moreover, there were various revisions and rectifications\n         of drawings done by JSPL, due to which a lot of work\n         was delayed. Furthermore, as per the condition of the\n         contract, payment must be made by JSPL within 1\n         month of the submission of the bill, but it was made\n         within an average of 3 months that too partially. During\n         this time, we received partial payment, and even after\n         repeated requests to provide reconciliation of accounts\n         and detailed deduction sheets, the same has not been\n         done till date.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">          Additionally, many GST payment of our invoice by\n         JSPL. have not been made, which is a criminal offense.\n         Also, suo-moto our scope of work was reduced by JSPL\n         without any intimation or discussion, whereas we had\n         deployed     machinery,   equipment,    material, and\n         manpower for the complete project and not the reduced\n         scope, which leads to much higher costs than\n         ascertained before the time of bidding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">         Till date, the entire deviation quantity from the\n         original scope has been submitted to JSPL\n         multiple times, but no payment has been made\n         regarding the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">         Despite all these issues, the contractor had been\n         working, but since March 2023, JSPL has been making\n         arbitrary decisions without proper consultation and\n         representation of the contractor, keeping the contractor\n         at their mercy, illegally stopping the contractor from\n         taking out its material and machinery.

It is evident that JSPL is engaging in a\n         criminal conspiracy to avoid paying the contractor and\n         impede their work by withholding essential resources\n         such as drawings, electricity, water, site access, and\n         accommodation. Additionally, they are blackmailing the\n         contractor by neglecting to verify the bill and\n         threatening to invoke the bank guarantee, all\n         while neglecting their contractual obligations as\n         the project owner/employer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">         Therefore, we urgently request your intervention to\n         review our bills, approve necessary deviations, and\n         promptly settle our outstanding payments.

This\n\nCourt is also of prima facie view that there are special equities in\n\nfavour of the Petitioner and if the Opposite Parties are permitted to\n\nencash the BG, it may cause irretrievable injustice to the\n\nPetitioner Company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">39.      Admittedly, the section 9 application is still pending for\n\nconsideration by the Commercial Court, Cuttack on merit and if at\n\nthis stage the Opposite Parties are permitted to invoke the Bank\n\nGuarantee, the prayer made in the section 9 application shall\n\nbecome infructuous.

As the Opposite Parties contested the present Writ\n\nPetition on technical grounds of maintainability so also scope\n\nregarding interference by the Court regarding invocation of Bank\n\nGuarantee and are yet to file their Objection in ARBP No.14 of\n\n2024, it is made clear that after filing of Objection by the Opposite\n\nParties, the Senior Civil Judge, Commercial Court, Cuttack shall\n\nproceed further in accordance with law and decide the prayer\n\nmade in ARBP No.14 of 2024 on merit taking into consideration\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">W.P.(C) No.11848 of 2024                                   Page 72 of 73</span>\n   the pleadings and documents on record, without being influenced\n\n  by the observations made above.
