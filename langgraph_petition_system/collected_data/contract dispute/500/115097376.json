The objections of the applicant were\n\ndiscussed and the final bill was shown to the\n\napplicant.

With regard to the\njurisdiction of the Chief Justice/his\ndesignate in the proceedings under\n<a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act, this Court\nculled out the legal position in paragraph\n51 (page 294) of the report as follows :</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n             &quot;51. The Chief Justice/his\n     designate              exercising\n     jurisdiction      under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 11</a>\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     of the Act will consider whether\n     there was         really accord\n     and satisfaction or discharge\n     of     contract     by\n     performance. If the answer is\n in the affirmative, he will\nrefuse to refer the dispute to\narbitration. On the other hand, if\nthe Chief Justice/his designate\ncomes to the conclusion that the\nfull and final settlement\nreceipt or discharge voucher\nwas the result of any\nfraud/coercion/ undue influence,\nhe will have to hold that there was\nno discharge of the contract\nand consequently, refer the\ndispute         to arbitration.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">Alternatively, where the Chief\nJustice/his designate is satisfied\nprima facie that the discharge\nvoucher was not issued\nvoluntarily and the claimant\nwas under some compulsion or\ncoercion, and that the matter\ndeserved detailed consideration,\nhe may instead of deciding the\nissue himself, refer the matter to\nthe Arbitral Tribunal with a\nspecific direction that the said\nquestion should be decided in the\nfirst instance.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">13.   The   Bench    in Boghara\n Polyfab Private Limited in paragraphs\n42 and 43 (page 291), with reference to\nthe cases cited before it, inter alia, noted\nthat there were two categories of the\ncited cases; (one) where the Court after\nconsidering the facts found that there\nwas a full and final settlement\nresulting in accord and satisfaction,\nand there was no substance in\nthe allegations of coercion/undue\ninfluence and, consequently, it was\nheld that there could be no reference of\nany dispute to arbitration and (two)\nwhere the court found some substance in\nthe contention of the claimants that `no\ndues/claim certificates&#x27; or `full and final\nsettlement discharge vouchers&#x27; were\ninsisted and taken (either in\nprinted format or otherwise) as a\ncondition precedent for release of the\nadmitted dues and thereby giving rise to\nan arbitrable dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">      14. In Boghara Polyfab Private\nLimited, the consequences of discharge\nof the contract were also considered. In\npara 25 (page 284), it was explained\nthat when a contract has been\nfully performed, then there is a discharge\n of the contract by performance and the\ncontract comes to an end and in\nregard to such a discharged\ncontract, nothing remains and\nthere cannot be any dispute and,\nconsequently, there cannot be reference\nto arbitration of any dispute arising\nfrom a discharged contract. It was\nheld that the question whether the\ncontract has been discharged by\nperformance or not is a mixed question of\nfact and law, and if there is a dispute\nin regard to that question, such\nquestion is arbitrable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">     15.     The Court, however,\nnoted an exception            to this\nproposition. The exception noticed is\nthat where both the parties to a\ncontract confirm in writing that the\ncontract has been fully and finally\ndischarged by performance of all\nobligations and there are no\noutstanding claims or disputes, courts\nwill not refer any subsequent claim or\ndispute to arbitration.     Yet another\nexception noted therein is with regard to\nthose cases where one of the parties to\nthe contract issues a full and final\n discharge voucher (or no-dues certificate,\nas the case may be) confirming that he\nhas received the payment in full and final\nsatisfaction of all claims, and he has no\noutstanding claim. It was observed that\nissuance of full and final discharge\nvoucher or no-dues certificate of that\nkind amounts to discharge of the contract\nby acceptance or performance and the\nparty              issuing              the\ndischarge\n                     voucher/certificate\ncannot thereafter make any fresh claim\nor revive any settled claim nor can it seek\nreference to arbitration in respect of any\nclaim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      16.   In SCC paragraph 26 (pages\n284-285), this Court in Boghara Polyfab\nPrivate Limited held that if a party which\nhas executed the discharge agreement\nor discharge voucher, alleges that\nthe execution      of such document\nwas      on            account          of\nfraud/coercion/undue          influence\npractised by the other party, and\nif that party establishes the same,\nthen such discharge voucher or\nagreement is rendered void and\n cannot     be    acted     upon     and\nconsequently, any dispute raised by such\nparty would be arbitrable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">     17. In SCC paragraph 24 (page\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">284) in      Boghara Polyfab Private\nLimited, this Court held        that a\nclaim for arbitration cannot be\nrejected merely or solely on the ground\nthat a settlement agreement or discharge\nvoucher has been executed by the\nclaimant. The Court stated that such\ndispute will have to be decided\nby the Chief Justice/his designate\nin the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n11</a> of the 1996 Act or by the Arbitral\nTribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      18. In our opinion, there is no rule\nof the absolute kind. In a case where\nthe claimant contends that a\ndischarge voucher or no-claim certificate\nhas been obtained by fraud, coercion,\nduress or undue influence and the other\nside contests the correctness thereof, the\nChief Justice/his designate must look into\nthis aspect to find out at least, prima\nfacie, whether or not the dispute\nis bona fide and genuine. Where\n             the dispute raised by the claimant\n            with regard to validity of the discharge\n            voucher or no-claim certificate or\n            settlement agreement, prima facie,\n            appears     to    be   lacking      in\n            credibility, there may not be\n            necessity to refer the dispute for\n            arbitration at all.â\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      12.       The Apex Court has specifically held that\n\n  designate to Chief Justice has to find out prima\n\n  facie whether or not the dispute is bona fide and\n\n  genuine and whether the dispute is in regard to\n\n  validity of the discharge voucher or no claim\n\n  certificate appear to be lacking in credibility. It is\n\n  not necessary to consider other judgments of the\n\n  Apex Court because in the aforesaid judgment, the\n\n  Apex Court has considered all the previous\n\n  judgments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">13.               In the present case, no claim certificate\n\nwhich is said be signed by the applicant is a content\n\nand part of the Clause which is mentioned in the bill.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">The applicant submitted the final bill. Prior to that, the\n\napplicant had already submitted an application dated\n 23.03.2013 Annexure-3 mentioning the fact that he\n\nwas submitted the final bill subject to the claim which\n\nmay be raised by him subsequently. Hence, in my\n\nopinion, it cannot be said that by submitting no claim\n\ncertificate which is a clause mentioned in the final bill,\n\nthe applicant precluded to raise the dispute and he\n\ncannot demand arbitration in terms of the contract\n\nagreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61100372\" id=\"span_14\">14.               In the present case, the respondents\n\ndid not appoint Arbitrator within a period of 90 days\n\nfrom the date of submitting the application by the\n\napplicant. Hence, they have forfeited their right to\n\nappoint Arbitrator in view of the judgment passed by\n\nthe Apex Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/61100372/\" id=\"a_19\">Deep Trading\n\nCompany vs. Indian Oil Corporation and others</a>\n\nreported in (2013) 4 SCC 35.
