The brief facts culled out of the petition\n\n         are that the petitioner is a company incorporated under\n\n         the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_3\">Indian Companies Act, 1956</a>, previously known as\n\n         Nagarjuna Construction Corporation Ltd., and operates\n\n         as a construction company. The Writ petition is filed\n\n         within the territorial jurisdiction of this Hon&#x27;ble Court,\n\n         as the contract was executed and the works was carried\n\n         out in Bihar, where the respondents are based, and\n\n         where the impugned orders were issued. On 06-08-\n\n         2009, the petitioner entered into a contract with the\n\n         respondents for the execution of &quot;Restoration of Eastern\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n                                           6/70\n\n\n\n\n         Gandak Canal System Including Gandak Barrage and\n\n         Its Appurtenants Under Rashtriya Sam Vikash Yojna.&quot;\n\n         The petitioner offered to perform the work at 44.53%\n\n         above the estimated value of Rs. 310.54 crores, totaling\n\n         Rs. 448.83 crores. A Letter of Acceptance (LoA) was\n\n         issued by the Water Resources Department of Bihar on\n\n         03-07-2009</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\"> in favour of the petitioner, confirming the\n\n         contract,       which        included         General   and   Special\n\n         Conditions of Contract (GCC and SCC). The contract\n\n         was formalized on 06.08.2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_2\">                          8. It is submitted by the petitioner that the\n\n         contract included General Conditions of Contract and\n\n         Special Conditions of Contract, with a 25-month\n\n         execution period. Despite the completion of work, the\n\n         respondents failed to finalize payments. However, due\n\n         to delays caused by the respondents, extensions were\n\n         granted. As per Clause 6 of the General Conditions of\n\n         Contract, no payment disputes could be raised after the\n\n         completion of the Defect Liability Period. The Defect\n\n         Liability Period was defined in Clause 11 of the special\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                           7/70</span>\n\n\n\n\n         condition of contract as a 12 months after work\n\n         completion. The Defect Liability Period for the entire\n\n         work ended in 2017, but the respondents did not\n\n         formalize extensions until 28-08-2018. The petitioner\n\n         raised concerns regarding delayed payments, including\n\n         the release of pending bills and bank guarantees.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">                          9. It is further contended on behalf of the\n\n         petitioner that disputes were to be resolved through\n\n         arbitration, with a sole arbitrator appointed by the\n\n         Engineer-in-Chief. The respondents issued a notice to\n\n         proceed with the work on 06-08-2009. The work was\n\n         certified as completed by the respondents on 01-04-\n\n         2015 for package No. 46, and on 22-06-2015 for\n\n         package Nos. 43, 44, and 45. It is submitted that the\n\n         petitioner submitted final bills for package Nos. 43, 44,\n\n         45, and 46 in the month of October 2015. The work was\n\n         officially completed by 30-06-2016, and the Defect\n\n         Liability Period ended on 30-06-2017. Despite this, the\n\n         respondents did not release the pending payments or\n\n         bank guarantees. In 2018, the petitioner requested the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                           8/70</span>\n\n\n\n\n         respondents to settle outstanding payments, but no\n\n         response was received.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">                          10. It is also contended on behalf of the\n\n         petitioner that on 28-08-2018, the respondents granted a\n\n         post facto extension of time for completion until 30-06-\n\n         2016. However, in 2018, the respondents sought to\n\n         recover payments related to package nos. 43, 44, and\n\n         45, as well as package 46. The petitioner contested these\n\n         recoveries, arguing that there were no over payments,\n\n         and requested the release of funds. Despite repeated\n\n         requests, including formal representations made in\n\n         2019, the respondents issued                         arbitrary   recovery\n\n         demands without providing justifications. For example,\n\n         on 14-05-2019, they demanded Rs. 4.61 crores in over\n\n         payments for packages 43-45, which the petitioner\n\n         denied, requesting documentation for verification.\n\n         Despite multiple Letters from the petitioner denying the\n\n         recovery        claims       and         requesting     resolution,   the\n\n         respondents continued to issue recovery notices and\n\n         threatened         to     confiscate          bank     guarantees.    By\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                           9/70</span>\n\n\n\n\n         30.08.2019, the petitioner had initiated arbitration\n\n         proceedings for both package Nos. 43-45 and package\n\n         No. 46 under Clause 25 of the General Conditions of\n\n         Contract. On 30.08.2019 and 04.09.2019, the Chief\n\n         Engineer rejected the petitioner&#x27;s claims for payment\n\n         and balance amounts, instead demanding Rs. 7.40 crores\n\n         for overpayment related to package No. 46 and Rs. 4.61\n\n         crores for package Nos.                       43-45. The petitioner\n\n         maintained that all contractual obligations were met and\n\n         disputes should be resolved through arbitration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">                          11.

Therefore,\n\n         the claim that the provisions of Clause 25 were not\n\n         followed is false.

However, the petitioner is now challenging\n\n         the validity of Clause 25, which cannot be done after the\n\n         agreement was executed and commencement of work.\n\n         The Writ petition was filed in 2019, and raising such a\n\n         challenge in 2025 is not maintainable, therefore, the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                          60/70</span>\n\n\n\n\n         prayer should be rejected.

Accordingly, the Writ court, exercising\n\n         its jurisdiction on <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 226</a>, cannot directly appoint\n\n         an arbitrator, especially when the petitioner has already\n\n         invoked under Clause 25 of the Agreement.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">                          58.

In contractual matters, the\n\n         terms of agreement are binding, and the stipulations\n\n         therein must be adhered to.

We do not find ourselves\n                                persuaded to uphold the forfeiture of\n                                EMD on the basis of a Letter which\n                                was not incorporated in the NIT.

On     the        above\n                                 reasoning, we find the forfeiture to be\n                                 illegal and not in consonance with the\n                                 NIT.

In the aforesaid case, the Hon&#x27;ble\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                          68/70</span>\n\n\n\n\n         Division Bench                opined that forfeiture of Bank\n\n         Guarantee is illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">                          63. On perusal of entire record, considering\n\n         the submissions and the contents of the written\n\n         arguments filed by both the parties, it is evident that\n\n         payments were made to the petitioner for package Nos.\n\n         43 - 45 as well as package No. 46 i.e., after defects\n\n         liability period. Later, respondents retained 50 % of the\n\n         security deposit of the petitioner, without the consent of\n\n         the petitioner, with a contention that overpayments\n\n         were done.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">                          64. In the light of aforementioned facts and\n\n         circumstances particularly regarding the withheld\n\n         amounts, including the retention money in the form of a\n\n         Bank Guarantee, this Court is of the considered opinion\n\n         that the respondent&#x27;s failure to release the retention and\n\n         withheld amounts, to which the petitioner is legally and\n\n         contractually entitled, is illegal and arbitrary in nature.\n\n         This is because the works assigned to the petitioner by\n Patna High Court CWJC No.20472 of 2019 dt.31-01-2025\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                          69/70</span>\n\n\n\n\n         the respondents have been duly completed by him.\n\n         Further, the respondents did not mention any defect of\n\n         the work, within the defect liability period. Admittedly,\n\n         the final bill was prepared by the respondents for which\n\n         payments were made. Any dispute between the parties\n\n         has to be resolved by an Arbitrator. In view of the\n\n         amendment in <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_46\">Arbitration Act</a>, Clause 25 of the\n\n         agreement is not valid in the eye of law. Therefore, the\n\n         respondents are directed to refund the withheld\n\n         amounts, including the retention money in the form of a\n\n         Bank Guarantee, forthwith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">                          65. With regard to the resolution of other\n\n         disputes, in question, through arbitration, this Court is\n\n         of the considered view that it as appropriate to direct the\n\n         petitioner         to move appropriate application under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n         1996, Appointment of Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of\n\n         Patna High Court Scheme, 1996 and also under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_48\">Article\n\n         226</a> of the Constitution of India.
