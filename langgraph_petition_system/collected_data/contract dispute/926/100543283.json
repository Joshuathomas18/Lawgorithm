However,   in   view   of   the   contention   that  \n              judgment   of   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Apex   Court   in   Yovan,   India  \n              Cement Employees Union vs. Management of India Ltd.,  \n              (supra) has not been considered by Division Bench, I am  \n              required to delve little more into the controversy. Before  \n              the   Hon&#x27;ble   Apex   Court,   the   issue   was   in   relation   to  \n              reference   of   a   dispute   regarding   contract   labour   in  \n              cement   industry.   The   reference   was   made   by   State  \n              Government   to   Labour   Court   and   employer   preferred  \n              the preliminary objection and contended that reference  \n              by   State   of   Tamil   Nadu   was   bad   as   appropriate  \n              Government in relation to cement industry was Central  \n              Government. This reference was made on 23.09.1987.  \n              The   employees   as   also   Union   of   India   relied   upon  \n              Notification dated 08.12.1977 issued under <a href=\"/doc/1022486/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 39</a>  \n              of   the   Industrial   Disputes   Act   which   mentioned   that  \n              powers exercisable by Central Government in relation to  \n              cement   industry   shall   also   be   exercised   by   State  \n              Government.   The   question   before   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Apex  \n              Court was which one was appropriate Government to  \n              make reference in the matter. The reference related to  \n              non employment of 300 workers. The Labour Court had  \n              held   that   Central   Government   was   appropriate  \n              Government and reference by State Government was not  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">::: Uploaded on - 31/07/2018                              ::: Downloaded on - 02/08/2018 00:14:33 :::</span>\n                                           12                  913-wp-4065-17.odt\n\n              competent. This order was challenged in Special Leave  \n              Petition. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in para 8 found that  \n              both   Central   and   State   Government   were   appropriate  \n              Governments under  <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_34\">Industrial  Disputes Act</a> and hence  \n              reference by Government of Tamil Nadu was held to be  \n              valid. In support, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court relied upon  \n              stand taken by Union of India in counter affidavit that  \n              both   Central   as   also   State   Government   are   the  \n              appropriate   Governments   in   view   of   the   Notification  \n              dated   08.12.1977.   Thus,   both   the   Governments   were  \n              held   to   be   appropriate   Governments   under   <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_35\">Industrial  \n              Disputes   Act</a>   for   cement   industry   in   view   of   the  \n              Notification dated 08.12.1977. Very same notification is  \n              relied   upon   by   present   petitioner   to   urge   that   the  \n              Central   Government   continues   to   be   appropriate  \n              Government in relation to its establishment/ industry.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"425673\" id=\"span_12\">10. Thus judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court is  \n              considered by Division Bench of Karnataka High Court  \n              in <a href=\"/doc/425673/\" id=\"a_36\">Workmen of Bagalkot Udyog Ltd. vs. Bagalkot Udyog  \n              Ltd.</a>,   (supra).     The   Hon&#x27;ble   High   Court   found   that  \n              provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1022486/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 39</a> permitted Central Government  \n              to   delegate   its   powers   to   State   Government   and  \n              delegatee cannot acquire a status equivalent to that of  \n              delegator. The delegator is never denuded of its powers  \n              and can strip off the powers of its delegatee. It has been,  \n              therefore, found in para 11 that even for the purposes of  \n              <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_38\">Industrial   Disputes   Act</a>,   State   Government   cannot   be  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">::: Uploaded on - 31/07/2018                           ::: Downloaded on - 02/08/2018 00:14:33 :::</span>\n                                            13                   913-wp-4065-17.odt\n\n              treated   as   appropriate   Government   in   relation   to  \n              Industrial Dispute concerning cement industry. In para  \n              12,   Karnataka   High   Court   considers   the   above  \n              judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and observed that  \n              the conclusions of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court needed to be  \n              understood in the context in which they were made and  \n              it cannot be taken as declaration of statutory statement  \n              of   affairs   devoid   of   the   context.   In   para   13,   other  \n              judgment   of  the  Hon&#x27;ble   Apex   Court  laying  down   the  \n              principles   for   appreciation   of   precedence   has   been  \n              pointed out. In para 14, it has concluded thus :</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                     &quot;14. Keeping in view the question raised before the  \n              Supreme   Court,   the   only   reasonable   inference   can   be  \n              that the Supreme Court has held that both the Central  \n              Government and the State Government can exercise the  \n              powers of an appropriate Government in relation to the  \n              cement   industry   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_39\">I.D.

The Division Bench of this Court has already  \n              concluded the controversy. Even if it is presumed that  \n              Central   Government   as   also   State   Government   are  \n              appropriate Government for cement industry, it becomes  \n              clear that provisions of <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_43\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a> cannot apply  \n              as Central Government then continues to be and also  \n              remains   an   appropriate   Government.   In   my   humble  \n              opinion, State Government while acting as appropriate  \n              Government discharges the role as an agent of Central  \n              Government and hence for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 2(3)</a>,  \n              it   cannot   be   said   that   for   cement   industry,   State  \n              Government is appropriate Government. The provisions  \n              of   <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_45\">MRTU   &amp;   PULP   Act</a>,   therefore,   cannot   apply   to  \n              industry   of   the   petitioner.
