The dispute was\n\n     referred to sole arbitration of Mr. O.P. Goel.         The\n\n     arbitrator made his Award on March 22, 1999 and\n\n     directed the Andaman and Nicobar Administration\n\n     to pay to the respondent a sum of Rs.2,81,83,305/-\n\n     (Rupees two crores eighty one lacs, eighty three\n\n     thousand, three hundred and five only) with 12%\n\n     interest per annum from the date of withholding of\n\n     the amount of Rs.41,42,000/- (Rupees forty one\n\n     lacs forty two thousand only) till the date of\n\n     payment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.

By judgment dated 29.9.2000 the learned\n\n     District Judge, Andaman and Nicobar Island, Port\n\n     Blair,   dismissed   the   application   with    cost   of\n\n     Rs.500/-. Thereupon, Union of India, through the\n\n     Executive Engineer, preferred an appeal, i.e., FAT\n\n     No. 4220 of 2001, before the High Court at\n\n     Calcutta.     The Division Bench of the High Court\n\n     dismissed the appeal by judgment dated 26.2.2001.\n\n     However, the High Court clarified that the claim No.\n\n     4 of the Award dated 22.3.1999 would stand\n\n     modified and the respondent-contractor would be\n\n     entitled to interest @ 12% per annum from the date\n\n     of reference of the dispute to arbitration till the date\n\n     of payment of the said amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.   Thereafter,    the   appellant,   who    is     Executive\n\n     Engineer, Construction Division II, APWD, South\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                                   4</span>\n\nAndaman, addressed a letter to the Superintending\n\nEngineer, Construction Circle No. 1, Andaman\n\nPublic Works     Department,        on 5.3.2001 giving\n\ndetails of the financial implication of the Award\n\ndated 22.3.1999.     The appellant received a letter\n\ndated March 30, 2001 from the Executive Engineer\n\n(PLG), CE&#x27;s Office, APWD, Port Blair stating that the\n\nprincipal component of the Award might be released\n\nto   the   agency,   i.e.,    the   respondent   herein,\n\nimmediately. The appellant thereupon wrote a letter\n\ndated 30.3.2001 to the Chief Engineer, APWD\n\nrequesting that the acceptance of the Award should\n\nbe    communicated           with    details   regarding\n\namount/principal component to be paid.           It was\n\nalso mentioned in the said letter that for delay, if\n\nany, in payment of the amount, he would not be\n\nresponsible.   The appellant thereafter addressed\n\nanother letter on the same day to the respondent\n\nrequesting it to intimate its acceptance of the Award\n\namount to Rs.2,81,83,305/- in full and final\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                               5</span>\n\nsettlement of its claim. The respondent thereupon\n\nreplied by a letter dated 30.3.2001 to the appellant\n\nthat it was not willing to accept the amount stated\n\nin the aforesaid letter.   The appellant, therefore,\n\nwrote another letter on 30.3.2001 to the respondent\n\ninforming that the principal component of the\n\nAward of Rs.2,81,83,305/- would be released on the\n\nsame day and requested the respondent to reconcile\n\nwith the appellant for mutual understanding about\n\npayment of interest. The respondent wrote a letter\n\nto the appellant on March 31, 2001 mentioning that\n\nit was willing to accept the principal amount of the\n\nAward &quot;at present&quot; but the remaining amount of the\n\ninterest etc. should be released within a fortnight.\n\nThereupon, the appellant addressed a letter dated\n\n2.4.2001 to the Chief Engineer, APWD, Port Blair,\n\nforwarding a copy of the letter received by him from\n\nthe respondent and pointed out that the respondent\n\nwas unwilling to accept the amount of the Award\n\nwithout interest. The appellant addressed another\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                                                   6</span>\n\n     letter    dated     2.4.2001   to    the    Chief      Engineer\n\n     informing him about the changed stand of the\n\n     respondent regarding its willingness to accept the\n\n     principal component of the Award and requested\n\n     him      to   communicate      the     decision        regarding\n\n     payment of interest without further delay.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.   The respondent filed Contempt Application No. 010\n\n     of 2001 in the month of April, 2001 under <a href=\"/doc/576566/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n\n     14</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 complaining\n\n     about     willful   and   deliberate       violation     of       the\n\n     judgment and decree dated February 26, 2001\n\n     passed in First Appeal T. No. 4220 of 2001.                       The\n\n     High Court issued notice to the respondent.                       On\n\n     notice being served, the appellant filed a reply\n\n     denying that there was willful and deliberate breach\n\n     of the decree passed by the court.             By impugned\n\n     judgment the Division Bench of the High Court at\n\n     Calcutta, Circuit Bench at Port Blair, found the\n\n     respondent guilty of contempt of court and while\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                            7</span>\n\n     accepting   the    unconditional      apology     of       the\n\n     appellant, imposed cost of Rs.200 GSM upon him to\n\n     be paid within a week. This judgment has given rise\n\n     to the instant appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.   This Court has heard the learned counsel for the\n\n     appellant and considered the documents forming\n\n     part of the instant appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">7.   From the facts mentioned above, it is evident that,\n\n     after Award of the arbitrator was confirmed by\n\n     Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, the\n\n     appellant had made an attempt to adjust the decree\n\n     in terms of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_3\">Order XXI Rule 2 of Code of Civil\n\n     Procedure</a> by requesting the respondent to accept\n\n     the   principal   amount      and   waive   the   interest\n\n     awarded thereon.    The contents of the two letters\n\n     written by the appellant to the respondent do not\n\n     show that any attempt was made by the appellant\n\n     to sit in appeal over the judgment of the High Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                                 8</span>\n\nThose two letters do not indicate that the appellant\n\nhad criticized the High Court for awarding interest\n\nin favour of the respondent.       The record would\n\nindicate that within the framework of law, the\n\nappellant had made an attempt to persuade the\n\nrespondent to forego claim relating to interest.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">Order XXI Rule 2 of Code of Civil Procedure</a> relates\n\nto the payment of amount to a decree holder out of\n\ncourt and inter alia provides that when any wrong\n\npayment under a decree of any other kind is paid\n\nout of court to the decree holder, the decree holder\n\nhas to certify payment made as required by the said\n\nRule. An agreement, which extinguishes the decree\n\nas such in whole or in part and results in the\n\nsatisfaction of the decree in respect of the particular\n\nrelief or reliefs granted by the decree, is an\n\n`adjustment&#x27; within the meaning of this Rule. It is\n\nopen to the parties to enter into a contract or\n\ncompromise with reference to their rights under the\n\ndecree. If the contract or the compromise amounts\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                   9</span>\n\nto an `adjustment&#x27; of the decree, it must be recorded\n\nunder this Rule and unless so recorded cannot be\n\nrecognized by the executing court.      Adjustment is\n\nnot the same as satisfaction of the decree but is\n\nsome method of settling decree which is not\n\nprovided for in the decree itself.    The right of the\n\njudgment debtor to make an attempt to adjust the\n\ndecree is independent and cannot be treated as\n\ncontempt of court. Having regard to the interest of\n\nthe   department   concerned,   the    appellant       had\n\naddressed letters to the respondent to adjust the\n\nAward. The letters for adjustment of Award could\n\nnot have been treated as contempt of court within\n\nthe meaning of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_5\">Contempt of\n\nCourts Act, 1971</a>.     The tenor of letters do not\n\nindicate that there was any willful disobedience on\n\nthe part of the appellant in not complying with the\n\njudgment of the High Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                           10</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">8.   Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that\n\n     writing of the letter dated 30.3.2001 amounts to\n\n     contempt, this Court finds that the two letters dated\n\n     30.3.2001 and 2.4.2001 addressed by the appellant\n\n     to the Chief Engineer, APWD, Port Blair, indicate\n\n     that the appellant had taken all possible steps to\n\n     comply with the Award confirmed by the High\n\n     Court.     According to the High Court, asking the\n\n     respondent to accept only the principal amount vide\n\n     letter dated 30.3.2001 amounts to violation of the\n\n     judgment of the High Court.           Having held so, the\n\n     High Court proceeded to examine the question\n\n     whether the violation of judgment of the High Court\n\n     would amount to the contempt of court. The High\n\n     Court      also   considered    the    question   whether\n\n     violation of judgment by the appellant was willful\n\n     and deliberate.     The High Court noticed that after\n\n     addressing letter dated 30.3.2001, another letter on\n\n     the same day was addressed by the appellant\n\n     inviting    the    respondent    for    negotiation   with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                   11</span>\n\nreference to the rate of interest payable to the\n\nrespondent and concluded that even if previous\n\nletter amounted to violation of the judgment of the\n\ncourt, the appellant did not do so willfully and\n\ndeliberately.        Though the High Court ostensibly\n\nproceeded       to    examine   the   question   whether\n\nviolation of the judgment of the High Court would\n\namount to contempt of court, the said question is\n\nneither determined nor answered one way or the\n\nother.   The error of law committed by the High\n\nCourt is that without answering the question\n\nwhether the violation of the judgment amounts to\n\nthe contempt of court, the High Court presumed\n\nthat the violation of the judgment amounts to\n\ncontempt of court and proceeded to examine the\n\nquestion whether the violation of judgment was\n\nwillful or deliberate. After reaching the conclusion\n\nthat the violation is neither willful nor deliberate,\n\nthe High Court should have at once dropped the\n\ncontempt proceedings and could not have accepted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                             12</span>\n\n      the unconditional apology tendered by the appellant\n\n      nor could have imposed cost on the appellant. In\n\n      any view of the matter, the High Court, after\n\n      accepting the unconditional apology tendered by the\n\n      appellant, should not have imposed cost on the\n\n      appellant for negligence and reckless manner in\n\n      which it had allegedly acted in the instant case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">9.    Further,     the   High   Court   itself   came   to    the\n\n      conclusion that a letter being written by the\n\n      Executive Engineer would not amount to willful and\n\n      deliberate disobedience of the decree of the court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">10.   On the facts and in the circumstances of the case,\n\n      this Court is of the opinion that the judgment\n\n      impugned cannot be sustained and is liable to be\n\n      set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">11.   For the foregoing reasons, the appeal succeeds. The\n\n      impugned judgment is set aside. The cost, if any,\n\n      recovered from the appellant be refunded to him.\n\n      The appeal stands, accordingly, disposed of.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                              13</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">12.
