A letter of\n\nacceptance dated 13.08.2021 was issued intimating that the bid of\n\nthe applicant has been accepted. The applicant was directed to\n\nprovide performance security guarantee of the amount equivalent\n\nto 2.50% of the cost of contract. It was also informed that terms\n\nand conditions, as mentioned under the bid document, shall be\n\napplicable over the said work. Thereafter, the applicant submitted\n\nperformance          guarantee      for    an       amount       of    Rs.95,25,000/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">Thereafter, an agreement was entered into between the applicant\n\nand the respondent on 08.09.2021 for supply of new glass nips\n\n180 ml and bottles 750 ml at various reduction centers of the\n\nrespondent. The period of agreement was one year from the\n\nsigning of the agreement, extendable for a further period of three\n\nmonths.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.    After execution of the agreement, the respondent issued\n\nseveral purchase orders for supply of the items in specified\n\nquantity to the referred reduction centers of respondent and the\n\napplicant started making supply. Vide letter dated 14.03.2022, the\n\nrespondent required the applicant to meet supply schedule of the\n\nglass bottles for the month of March, 2022. It is the case of the\n\napplicant    that      owing     to     certain      increase         in    the   cost   of\n\nmanufacturing and the agreement being silent on the issue of\n\nvariation in cost in case of increase, it became impossible for the\n\napplicant to perform its obligation and continue its supply.

According to the\n\napplicant, it was on account of pandemic situation resulting in\n\nsteep rise in cost of material including raw material required to be\n\nprocured for manufacturing of glass bottles as well as nips.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">Because of the sudden and unforeseen inflation in price of the\n\ndominant raw material for manufacturing of bottles, it became\n\nimpossible to continue supplies. The respondent did not respond\n\nto applicant&#x27;s application and, therefore, the applicant was under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">belief that the request of the applicant has been acceded to.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">However, the respondent issued a letter on 16.05.2022 to the\n\nbanker of the applicant requiring to revoke the bank guarantee\n\nfurnished by the applicant owing to the fact that the applicant is\n\nnot making supplies of bottles, which was informed to the\n\napplicant by its banker on 20.05.2022. In these circumstances,\n\nthe applicant filed a suit praying for permanent injunction against\n\nits banker not to entertain any request for encashment of the\n\nbank guarantee, whereupon an interim order directing the parties\n\nto maintain status quo was passed by the Civil Court on\n\n23.05.2022. The applicant also submitted an application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 9</a> of the Act of 1996 before the Commercial Court. The\n\nsaid application was however rejected on 18.07.2022, against\n\nwhich an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 37</a> of the Act of 1996 was\n\npreferred and the same is pending.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.    During pendency of the aforesaid proceedings, the applicant\n\nreceived an office order dated 25.05.2022 intimating that the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                     (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                       (4 of 24)                         [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\nrespondent has terminated the contract awarded to the applicant\n\nand it has also been blacklisted. Recovery of an amount of\n\nRs.2,05,34,844/- was raised. Thereafter, another letter was issued\n\non 04.07.2022, by which the respondent swelled the amount of\n\nrecovery to the tune of Rs.4,21,56,882/-. Thus, a total recovery of\n\nRs.6,26,91,726/- was demanded, which was protested by the\n\napplicant vide its letter dated 05.08.2022.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.    Since Clause 18 of the General Terms and Conditions of Bid\n\nand Contract provided for resolution of dispute through the\n\nprocess of arbitration, the present application has been filed\n\nstating that the dispute has arisen between the parties on account\n\nof   termination     of      contract       and      imposition       of    penalty   and\n\nblacklisting, which according to the applicant are illegal. It is the\n\ncase of the applicant that due to frustration and impossibility, the\n\ncontract could no longer be performed. Moreover, the respondent\n\nhas raised exorbitant and illegal recovery of more than Rs.6 crores\n\nand has also blacklisted the applicant. Therefore, a prayer for\n\nappointment of an arbitrator has been made.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.    In reply, the respondent stated that under the agreement\n\nbetween the parties, it was mutually agreed, as per Clause 31 of\n\nthe Special Terms and Conditions of the Contract, that rate quoted\n\nshall remain firm during currency of the supply contract and no\n\nescalation would be allowed. Therefore, the claim of escalation is\n\nbeyond the subject matter of dispute under the agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">According to the respondent, the claim is outside the scope of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                          (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                  (5 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\nagreement and, therefore, it is not arbitrable. There is no tenable\n\ndispute with regard to contract where arbitration clause could be\n\nmade applicable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">6.    As against the applicant&#x27;s claim that a dispute has arisen,\n\nwhich ought to be referred to an Arbitrator for adjudication of\n\ndispute through the process of arbitration, the respondent has\n\ncome out with a case of non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">7.    It is also not in dispute that the agreement between the\n\nparties contains arbitration clause 18, which reads as under:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           &quot;In case of any dispute arising out of any matter\n     related to the bid/contract/agreement, the matter will\n     be referred to sole arbitrator appointed by Director in\n     charge RSGSM whose decision shall be final and binding\n     on both the parties. The seat of arbitration shall be\n     Jaipur. The fee and other expenses of the arbitrator\n     shall be borne by both the parties equally.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">8.    There is no dispute with regard to existence of agreement\n\nbetween the parties, but the issue raised by the respondent is with\n\nregard to non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">9.    This aspect is required to be considered keeping in forefront\n\nthe legal position, as adumbrated in plethora of decisions of the\n\nApex Court dealing with the aspect of non-arbitrability of the\n\ndispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">10. A Larger Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nVidya Drolia &amp; Others Versus Durga Trading Corporation, (2021) 2\n\nSupreme Court Cases 1, while deciding a reference made to it, has\n\nexamined in great details the legal position with regard to scope of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                     (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                   (6 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\njudicial review at the referral stage both on the aspects of\n\nexistence of agreement and non arbitrability. Navigating through\n\nvarious provisions of the Act of 1996, amendments made from\n\ntime to time and survey of earlier decisions dealing with the\n\naforesaid aspects, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court examined legal\n\nposition as below:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92712826\" id=\"span_6\">&quot;31. We are clearly bound by the dictum of the\n     Constitutional Bench judgment in Patel Engineering Ltd.\n     that the scope and ambit of court&#x27;s jurisdiction under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 8</a> or 11 of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_6\">Arbitration Act</a> is similar. An\n     application under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act need\n     not set out in detail the disputes or the claims and may\n     briefly refer to the subject matter or broad contours of the\n     dispute. However, where judicial proceedings are initiated\n     and pending, specific details of the claims and disputes are\n     normally pleaded and, therefore, the court or the judicial\n     authority has the advantage of these details. There is a\n     difference between a non-arbitrable claim and non-\n     arbitrable subject matter. Former may arise on account of\n     scope of the arbitration agreement and also when the\n     claim is not capable of being resolved through arbitration.\n     Generally non-arbitrability of the subject matter would\n     relate to non-arbitrability in law. Further, the decision in\n     Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. has to be read along with\n     subsequent judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/92712826/\" id=\"a_8\">Chloro Controls India\n     Private Limited v. Severn Trent Water Purification Inc.</a>\n     (2013) 1 SCC 641.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     32.    .......\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">     71. Complexity is not sufficient to ward off arbitration. In\n     terms of the mandate of Section 89 of the Civil Procedure\n     Code and the object and purpose behind the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_9\">Arbitration\n     Act</a> and the mandatory language of <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_11\">11</a>, the\n     mutually agreed arbitration clauses must be enforced. The\n     language of <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_13\">11</a> of the Arbitration Act are\n     peremptory in nature. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_14\">Arbitration Act</a> has been enacted to\n     promote arbitration as a transparent, fair, and just\n     alternative to court adjudication. Public policy is to\n     encourage and strengthen arbitration to resolve and settle\n     economic, commercial and civil disputes. Amendments\n     from time to time have addressed the issues and corrected\n     the inadequacies and flaws in the arbitration procedure. It\n     is for the stakeholders, including the arbitrators, to assure\n     that the arbitration is as impartial, just, and fair as court\n     adjudication. It is also the duty of the courts at the post-\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                      (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\"> [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                  (7 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\n     award stage to selectively yet effectively exercise the\n     limited jurisdiction, within the four corners of <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n     34(2)(b)(ii)</a> read with Explanations 1 and 2 and check any\n     conflict with the fundamental policy of the applicable law.\n     We would subsequently refer to the &#x27;second look&#x27; principle\n     which is applicable in three specific situations dealing with\n     arbitrability as per the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 34</a> of the\n     Arbitration Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">     72. Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada in TELUS\n     Communications Inc. v. Avraham Wellman, (2019) SCC 19\n     while conceding that arbitration as a method of dispute\n     resolution was met with &quot;overt hostility&quot; for a long time on\n     public policy grounds as it ousts jurisdiction of courts,\n     observed that the new legislation, the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_17\">Arbitration Act</a> of\n     1991, marks a departure as it encourages parties to adopt\n     arbitration in commercial and other matters. By putting\n     party autonomy on a high pedestal, the Act mandates that\n     the parties to a valid arbitration agreement must abide by\n     the consensual and agreed mode of dispute resolution. The\n     courts must show due respect to arbitration agreements\n     particularly in commercial settings by staying the court\n     proceedings, unless the legislative language is to the\n     contrary. The principle of party autonomy goes hand in\n     hand with the principle of limited court intervention, this\n     being the fundamental principle underlying modern\n     arbitration law. Party autonomy is weaker in non-\n     negotiated &quot;take it or leave it&quot; contracts and, therefore,\n     the legislature can through statutes shield the weakest and\n     vulnerable contracting parties like consumers. This is not\n     so in negotiated agreements or even in adhesion contracts\n     having an arbitration clause in commercial settings. Virtues\n     of commercial and civil arbitration have been recognised\n     and accepted and the courts even encourage the use of\n     arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">     73.    .........\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">     76. In view of the above discussion, we would like to\n     propound a four-fold test for determining when the subject\n     matter of a dispute in an arbitration agreement is not\n     arbitrable:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     76.1 (1) when cause of action and subject matter of the\n     dispute relates to actions in rem, that do not pertain to\n     subordinate rights in personam that arise from rights in\n     rem.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     76.2 (2) when cause of action and subject matter of the\n     dispute affects third party rights; have erga omnes effect;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">     require centralized adjudication, and mutual adjudication\n     would not be appropriate and enforceable.\n     76.3 (3) when cause of action and subject matter of the\n     dispute relates to inalienable sovereign and public interest\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                     (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                  (8 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\n     functions of the State and hence mutual adjudication\n     would be unenforceable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">     76.4 (4) when the subject-matter of the dispute is\n     expressly or by necessary implication non-arbitrable as per\n     mandatory statute(s).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">     76.5 These tests are not watertight compartments; they\n     dovetail and overlap, albeit when applied holistically and\n     pragmatically will help and assist in determining and\n     ascertaining with great degree of certainty when as per\n     law in India, a dispute or subject matter is non-arbitrable.\n     Only when the answer is affirmative that the subject\n     matter of the dispute would be non-arbitrable.\n     76.6. However, the aforesaid principles have to be applied\n     with care and caution as observed in Olympus\n     Superstructures (P) Ltd.: (SCC p.669, para 35)\n          &quot;35...Reference is made there to certain disputes\n          like criminal offences of a public nature, disputes\n          arising out of illegal agreements and disputes\n          relating to status, such as divorce, which cannot be\n          referred to arbitration. It has, however, been held\n          that if in respect of fats relating to a criminal\n          matter, say, physical injury, if there is a right to\n          damages for personal injury, then such a dispute\n          can be referred to arbitration (Keir v. Leeman).\n          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1690928\" id=\"span_9\">Similarly, it has been held that a husband and a\n          wife may refer to arbitration the terms on which\n          they shall separate, because they can make a valid\n          agreement between themselves on that matter\n          (Soilleux v.

Applying the above principles to determine non-\n     arbitrability, it is apparent that insolvency or intracompany\n     disputes have to be addressed by a centralized forum, be\n     the court or a special forum, which would be more efficient\n     and has complete jurisdiction to efficaciously and fully\n     dispose of the entire matter. They are also actions in rem.\n     Similarly, grant and issue of patents and registration of\n     trademarks are exclusive matters falling within the\n     sovereign or government functions and have erga omnes\n     effect. Such grants confer monopoly rights. They are non-\n     arbitrable. Criminal cases again are not arbitrable as they\n     relate to sovereign functions of the State. Further,\n     violations of criminal law are offenses against the State\n     and not just against the victim. Matrimonial disputes\n     relating to the dissolution of marriage, restitution of\n     conjugal rights etc. are not arbitrable as they fall within\n     the ambit of sovereign functions and do not have any\n     commercial and economic value. The decisions have erga\n     omnes effect.

Therefore, the question - &#x27;Who decides non-\n     arbitrability?&#x27; and, in particular, the jurisdiction of the court\n     at the first look stage, that is, the referral stage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">     83.    ...........\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">     84. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_21\">Under the Arbitration Act, 1940</a>, the jurisdiction to\n     settle and decide non-arbitrability issues relating to\n     existence, validity, scope as well as whether the subject\n     matter was capable of arbitration, with possible exception\n     in case of termination, novation, frustration and &#x27;accord\n     and satisfaction&#x27; when contested on facts, was determined\n     and decided at the first or at the reference stage by the\n     courts. The principle being that the court should be\n     satisfied about the existence of a valid arbitration\n     agreement and that the disputes have arisen with regard\n     to the subject matter of the arbitration agreement. At this\n     stage, the court would be, however, not concerned with\n     the merits or sustainability of the disputes. Despite best\n     efforts to contain obstructive tactics, adjudication and final\n     decision of non-arbitrability issues at the reference stage\n     would invariably stop, derail and thwart the proceedings in\n     the courts for years.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">     85.    ............\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"180850491\" id=\"span_11\">132. The courts at the referral stage do not perform\n     ministerial functions. They exercise and perform judicial\n     functions when they decide objections in terms of\n     <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_23\">11</a> of the Arbitration Act. <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8</a>\n     prescribes the courts to refer the parties to arbitration,\n     if the action brought is the subject of an arbitration\n     agreement, unless it finds that prima facie no valid\n     arbitration agreement exists. Examining the term &#x27;prima\n     facie&#x27;, in <a href=\"/doc/180850491/\" id=\"a_25\">Nirmala J. Jhala v. State of Gujarat</a>, (2013) 4\n     SCC 301, this Court had noted: (SCC p.320, para 48)\n         &quot;48. &#x27;27.... A prima facie case does not mean a case\n         proved to the hilt but a case which can be said to\n         be established if the evidence which is led in\n         support of the case were [to be] believed. While\n         determining whether a prima facie case had been\n         made out or not the relevant consideration is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                     (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                 (10 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\n         whether on the evidence led it was possible to\n         arrive at the conclusion in question and not\n         whether that was the only conclusion which could\n         be arrived at on that evidence.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">     133. Prima facie case in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> is not\n     to be confused with the merits of the case put up by the\n     parties which has to be established before the arbitral\n     tribunal. It is restricted to the subject matter of the suit\n     being prima facie arbitrable under a valid arbitration\n     agreement. Prima facie case means that the assertions\n     on these aspects are bona fide. When read with the\n     principles of separation and competence-competence\n     and <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, the referral court\n     without getting bogged-down would compel the parties\n     to abide unless there are good and substantial reasons\n     to the contrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">     134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a\n     primary first review to weed out manifestly and ex facie\n     non-existent and invalid arbitration agreements and\n     non-arbitrable disputes. The prima facie review at the\n     reference stage is to cut the deadwood and trim off the\n     side branches in straight forward cases where dismissal\n     is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law\n     the litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the\n     court is certain that no valid arbitration agreement\n     exists or the disputes/subject matter are not arbitrable,\n     the application under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8</a> would be rejected. At\n     this stage, the court should not get lost in thickets and\n     decide debatable questions of facts. Referral proceedings\n     are preliminary and summary and not a mini trial. This\n     necessarily reflects on the nature of the jurisdiction\n     exercised by the court and in this context, the\n     observations of B.N.

Conversely, if the court\n     becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine\n     effectiveness of both the arbitration and the court. There\n     are certain cases where the prima facie examination\n     may require a deeper consideration. The court&#x27;s\n     challenge is to find the right amount of and the context\n     when it would examine the prima facie case or exercise\n     restraint.

Sub-section (6-A) was omitted by\n     Act 33 of 2019, but the omission is in view of the\n     introduction of a new regime of institutionalised\n     arbitration as per the report of the committee headed by\n     Justice B.

This also\n     requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion\n     on arbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie\n     scrutiny of the facts must lead to a clear conclusion that\n     there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is\n     non-arbitrable.

Therefore, to the extent the applicant&#x27;s\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                     (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                       (21 of 24)                       [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\nclaim of escalation is clearly not tenable and outside the scope of\n\nagreement between the parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">16. Apparently, the respondent terminated the contract on\n\naccount of failure on the part of the applicant to continue supplies\n\nas per the terms and conditions of the contract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">17. However, apart from challenge to termination of contract\n\nbeing    illegal,    the     applicant       has      also     disputed     the   amount\n\nrecoverable against it on account of its failure to supply balance\n\nquantity for the remaining period of contract. Therefore, even for\n\nthe argument sake, if it is accepted that the termination of\n\ncontract was valid for the reason that the applicant failed to\n\nensure supply of balance quantity, as per schedule, during the\n\nperiod of contract, a serious issue with regard to amount\n\nrecoverable against the applicant has been raised. The respondent\n\nhas issued recovery letter for recovery of an amount to the tune of\n\nRs.6,26,91,726/-, which is clear from letter dated 04.07.2022 of\n\nthe respondent. That, according to the respondent, is calculated\n\naccording to clause 8 dealing with risk and cost value as also the\n\nclaim loss of Rs.2,05,34,844/- under clause 7 of the supply order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\">According to the applicant, calculation has not been made in\n\naccordance with the terms of the contract. The respondent has not\n\ndemonstrated whether any supply of balance quantity was being\n\nplaced. The respondent has failed to show that supply of balance\n\nquantity was procured at higher rates and further it has not been\n\npointed out by the respondent that the order dated 16.05.2022\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                           (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                 (22 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\nwas for the balance quantity allegedly not supplied by the\n\napplicant. Further, the applicant has been blacklisted also. The\n\nbank guarantee has also been invoked, which is clear from\n\nrespondent&#x27;s letter dated 25.05.2022.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">18. As per the settled legal position, as adumbrated in plethora\n\nof decisions referred to above, when it is manifestly and expressly\n\ncertain that the dispute is not-arbitrable, prayer for appointment\n\nof arbitrator may be rejected. The restricted and limited review is\n\nto check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate when\n\nthe matter is demonstrably &#x27;non-arbitrable&#x27; and to cut off the\n\ndeadwood. The court by default would refer the matter when\n\ncontentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly arguable. At\n\nthe referral stage, it is not for the Court to enter into a mini trial\n\nor elaborate review so as to usurp the jurisdiction of the arbitral\n\ntribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity and efficacy of\n\narbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism. The\n\ncourt, at the reference stage, exercises judicial powers. When it\n\nappears that prima facie review would be inconclusive, or on\n\nconsideration inadequate as it requires detailed examination, the\n\nmatter should be left for final determination by the arbitral\n\ntribunal selected by the parties by consent. In such cases, a full\n\nreview by the court at the referral stage would encroach on the\n\njurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and violate the legislative\n\nscheme allocating jurisdiction between the courts and the arbitral\n\ntribunal. It has been consistently held that centralisation of\n\nlitigation with the arbitral tribunal as the primary and first\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                     (Downloaded on 29/04/2024 at 08:42:33 PM)</span>\n [2023:RJ-JP:33045]                  (23 of 24)                    [ARBAP-109/2022]\n\n\nadjudicator is beneficent as it helps in quicker and efficient\n\nresolution of dispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">19. Importantly, it has been held in decisions, referred to\n\nhereinabove, that while dealing with petition under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 11</a>, the\n\nCourt by default would refer the matter when contentions relating\n\nto non-arbitrability are plainly arguable. In such case, arbitration\n\nis left open for decision by the Arbitral Tribunal. It is only in a very\n\nlimited category of cases when there is no doubt that claim is\n\nexpressly time barred and/or that the dispute is non-arbitrable\n\nthat the Court may decline to make reference. However, if there is\n\neven slightest doubt, the rule is to refer the dispute to arbitration,\n\notherwise it would encroach upon jurisdiction of the arbitral\n\ntribunal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">20. In view of above considerations, the legal position and its\n\napplication to the factual details of the dispute between the\n\nparties, this Court is inclined to refer the dispute between the\n\nparties for adjudication through the process of arbitration as per\n\narbitration clause. Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice Prakash Gupta (Retd.), 41,\n\nMahadev Nagar, Nandpuri, Hawa Sadak, Jaipur, is appointed as the\n\nSole Arbitrator to adjudicate upon the dispute and pass an award.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">The Sole Arbitrator shall be entitled to fee, as provided under\n\nFourth Schedule appended to the Act of 1996.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">21.
