Clauses 2 and 5 of the said  agreement\nwere as follows,-\n&quot;   2.\tThat this agreement shall apply to  all\t the  Clerks\nemployed  in the local mills, i. e., persons doing  clerical\nwork, that is those who do routine work of writing,  copying\nor  making calculations and shall also\tinclude\t compounders\nand  assistant\tcompounders who are qualified  and  who\t are\nemployed in the local mills.\n5.

No  unfailing  test\tcan,\nhowever,  be  laid  down when an error of law  is  an  error\napparent on the face of the record and the rule that it must\nbe  self-evident, requiring no elaborate examination of\t the\nrecord, is a satisfactory practical test in a large majority\nof cases.\nRex v.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered\nby\nGAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-The principal question which this  appeal\nby  special  leave raises for our decision  relates  to\t the\nnature\tand  extent  of the jurisdiction  conferred  on\t the\nauthority by<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_12\"> s. 15</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">223</span>\n<a href=\"/doc/794158/\" id=\"a_13\">Payment of Wages Act, 1936</a> (Act 4 of 1936) (hereafter called\nthe Act).  This question arises in this way.  The  appellant\nShri  Ambica Mills Co. Ltd., is a textile mill&#x27;\t working  at\nAhmedabad.    Three  of\t its  employees\t named\t Punamchand,\nShamaldas  and\tVishnuprasad  made  an\tapplication  to\t the\nauthority  under  s. 16 of the Act and prayed for  an  order\nagainst\t the appellant to pay them their delayed wages.\t  In\norder to appreciate the( contentions raised by the appellant\ndisputing  the\tvalidity  of the respondents&#x27;  claim  it  is\nnecessary  to set out the background of the dispute in\tsome\ndetail.\t It appears that an award called the Standardisation\nAward  which  covered  the mill industry  in  Ahmedabad\t was\npronounced by the Industrial Tribunal on April 21, 1948,  in\nIndustrial  Reference No. 18 of 1947.  This award fixed\t the\nwages  for  different categories of workers working  in\t the\ntextile\t mills at Ahmedabad, but left over the\tquestion  of\nclerks\tfor future decision.  Amongst the  operatives  whose\nwages were determined by the award the case of\thand-folders\nwas specifically argued before the Industrial Tribunal.\t The\nLabour Association urged that the rate of Rs. 36-9-0 awarded\nto  them was too low and it was pointed out on their  behalf\nthat  they  did the same work as cut-lookers did  in  Bombay\nwhere  a head cut-looker was given Rs. 52 and a\t cut-looker\nRs.  42-4-0.   On the other hand the mill  owners  contended\nthat  the rate should have been fixed at Rs. 34-2-0  instead\nof  Rs. 36-9-0.\t The Tribunal found it difficult  to  decide\nthe  point  because enough evidence had\t not  been  produced\nbefore\tit to show the kind of work that  hand-folders\twere\ndoing  at Ahmedabad; that is why the Tribunal was unable  to\nraise the wage of hand-folders to that of  out-lookers\tin\nBombay.\t  However, it made a significant direction  in\tthat\nbehalf in these words: &quot;At the same time&quot;, it was  observed,\n&quot;we  desire to make it clear that if there are\tpersons\t who\nare  doing  cut-looking as well as folding, they  should  be\npaid  the rate earned by the out-lookers in  Bombay&quot;.\tThis\nquestion has been considered by the Tribunal in paragraph 16\nof its award.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">The  question  of  clerks, the decision of  which  had\tbeen\nadjourned by the Tribunal was later considered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">224</span>\nby it and an award pronounced in that behalf.  However,\t the\nsaid  award was later terminated by the clerks in 1949,\t and\nthat led to an agreement between the Ahmedabad Mill  Owners&#x27;\nAssociation and the Textile Labour Association in the matter\nof  wages payable to clerks.  This agreement was reached  on\nJune  22,  1949.   Clauses 2 and 5  of\tthis  agreement\t are\nmaterial  for the purpose of this appeal.  Let us  therefore\nread the two clauses:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t      &quot;2. That this agreement shall apply to all the\n\t      Clerks  employed\tin the\tlocal  mills,  i.e.,\n\t      persons doing clerical work, that is those who\n\t      do routine work of writing, copying or  making\n\t      calculations    and   shall    also    include\n\t      compounders and assistant compounders who\t are\n\t      qualified\t and who are employed in  the  local\n\t      mills.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t      5.      A\t separate  scale for  those  of\t the\n\t      employees\t who occupy the position lower\tthan\n\t      that  of a full-fledged Clerk but higher\tthan\n\t      that  of\tan  operative will  be\tprovided  as\n\t      under:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      Rs. 40-3-70-EB-4-90-5-105.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t      This  scale  will\t be applicable\tin  case  of\n\t      ticket-boy,  ticket-checker,   coupons-seller,\n\t      talley-boy,   scale-boy,\t production-checker,\n\t      thread-counter,\tcloth-measurer\t or    yard-\n\t      counter,\tfine-reporter,\tcloth/yarn-examiner,\n\t      department  store\t man, cut-looker  and  those\n\t      others  who have not been included  above\t but\n\t      who   can\t properly  fall\t under\t the   above\n\t      category.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">After this agreement was thus reached persons doing the work\nof cut-lookers began to feel that they were entitled to\t the\nbenefit\t of  cl. 5 and some claims were put  forth  on\tthat\nbasis  against the employers.  Vishnuprasad  and  Punamchand\napplied before the authority (Applications Nos. 39 and 40 of\n1954) and claimed delayed wages against the appellant on the\nground\tthat  they  were  entitled  to\thigher\twages  under\nparagraph 16 of the award in Reference No. 18 of 1947.\tThis\nclaim  was resisted by the appellant.  The  appellant  urged\nthat  the applications were not maintainable under the\tAct,\nthat they were barred in view of an arbitration award  which\nwas then in operation and that on the merits the  applicants\nwere not doing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">225</span>\nthe  work  of  cut-looking.   All  these  contentions\twere\nrejected by the authority.  It examined the duties performed\nby  the applicants, and it came to the conclusion that\tboth\nthe   applicants   were\t folders  doing\t  cut-looking,\t and\nconsequently  they  were  entitled each to  Rs.\t 42-4-0\t per\nmonth; in other words, the authority came to the  conclusion\nthat  the  applicants  properly,  fell\tunder  the  category\nspecified in paragraph 16 of the award referred to above and\nas such they were entitled to recover the difference between\nRs. 36-9-0 per month which was paid to each one of them\t and\nRs. 42-4-0 which was due to each one of them.  This decision\nwas announced on September 2, 1954.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">On  July  11,  1955,  the  present  respondents\t moved\t the\nauthority under<a href=\"/doc/667602/\" id=\"a_14\"> s. 16</a> of the Act.  They urged that they were\nsemi-clerks  and  occupied a position lower than that  of  a\nfull-fledged clerk and higher than that of an operative, and\nas  such  they were governed by cl. 5 of the  agreement\t and\nwere  entitled\tto increment provided by  the  said  clause.\nThis claim was resisted by the appellant on several grounds.\nIt  was urged that the present applications were  barred  by\nres  judicata,\tthat the authority had\tno  jurisdiction  to\nentertain  the\tapplications,  and that on  the\t merits\t the\nrespondents were not semi-clerks as contemplated by cl. 5 of\nthe  agreement.\t On these contentions the  authority  raised\nfour issues.  It held against the respondents and in  favour\nof the appellant on issues 1 and 2 which related to the plea\nof res judicata and the status of the respondents.  In\tview\nof the said findings it thought it unnecessary to decide the\ntwo remaining issues which dealt with the quantum of  amount\nclaimed by the respondents.  It appears that the question of\njurisdiction, though urged in its pleading by the appellant,\nwas  not raised as an issue and has not been  considered  by\nthe  authority.\t  The finding of res judicata  was  recorded\nagainst Punamchand and Vishnuprasad.  Shamaldas had not made\nany previous application and so no question of res  judicata\narose\tagainst\t his  application.   His   application\t was\ndismissed  only\t on the ground that he could not  claim\t the\nstatus of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">29</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">226</span>\nsemi-clerk.   The same finding was recorded against the\t two\nother respondents.  It appears that at the trial before\t the\nauthority the parties filed a joint Pursis which  enumerated\nthe  duties performed by the respondents in paragraphs 2  to\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">7. The authority took the view that &quot;the duties performed by\nthem  cannot be said to be the duties of persons  doing\t the\nroutine\t work of writing, copying and making  calculations&quot;.\nIn the result it was held that the respondents were governed\nby  the\t Standardisation Award and did not  fall  under\t the\nsubsequent agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">This  decision was challenged by the respondents before\t the\nDistrict  Judge\t who was the appellate authority  under\t the\nAct.  The appellate authority also was asked to consider the\nquestion   of  jurisdiction.   It  examined   the   relevant\nprovisions  of\tthe  Act and held  that\t the  authority\t had\njurisdiction to entertain the applications made before it by\nthe respondents.  On the question of res judicata it  agreed\nwith the finding of the authority, and held that the  claims\nmade  by  Punamchand  and Vishnuprasad were  barred  by\t res\njudicata.   Similarly, on the question of the status of\t the\nrespondents it agreed that they were not semi clerks.  It is\nclear  from the judgment of the appellate authority that  in\ndetermining  the  status of the respondents,  the  appellate\nauthority  applied  the\t same test as  was  invoked  by\t the\nauthority, and it considered the question as to whether\t the\nduties\tperformed  by the respondents were  similar  to\t the\nduties\tperformed by clerks.  It is obvious that  the  tests\napplied\t are tests relevant to the employees  falling  under\ncl.  2\tof the agreement, and since the application  of\t the\nsaid  tests led to the conclusion that the  respondents\t did\nnot fall under el. 2 the appellate authority held that el. 5\nwas  inapplicable to them; in other words, the judgments  of\nboth the authority and the appellate authority clearly\tshow\nthat they took the view that el. 2 was wholly  determinative\nof the issue, and that unless an. employee fell under cl.  2\nhe  cannot claim to be covered by any part of the  agreement\nincluding el. 5. That is why the appeals preferred by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">227</span>\nthe respondents were dismissed by the appellate authority on\nSeptember 2, 1954.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">These appellate decisions were challenged by the respondents\nby  filing  a writ petition under Arts. 226 and 227  of\t the\nConstitution before the Bombay High Court.  The Bombay\tHigh\nCourt has held that the decision of the appellate  authority\nwas  patently erroneous in law in that it proceeded  on\t the\nassumption that unless cl. 2 of the agreement was  satisfied\ncl. 5 would be inapplicable.  It also held that the  finding\nconcurrently  recorded\tby  the\t authorities  below  on\t the\nquestion of res judicata against two of the respondents\t was\nmanifestly  erroneous.\t On these findings  the\t High  Court\nallowed\t the  writ petition filed by  the  respondents,\t set\naside the orders of the authorities below and sent the\tcase\nback to the authority for dealing with it in accordance with\nlaw  in\t the  light of the judgment delivered  by  the\tHigh\nCourt.\t It is against this decision that the appellant\t has\npreferred the present appeal by special leave.\nThe first contention which the learned Attorney-General\t has\nraised before us on behalf of the appellant is that the High\nCourt has exceeded its jurisdiction under Arts. 226 and\t 227\nin interfering with the decision of the appellate authority.\nHe &#x27;contends that at the highest the error committed by\t the\nappellate  authority  is one of law but it is not  an  error\napparent  on the face of the record, and he argues  that  it\nwas  not within the competence of the High Court to  sit  in\nappeal\tover  the judgment of the  appellate  authority\t and\nexamine meticulously the correctness or the propriety of the\nconclusions reached by it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">The question about the nature and extent of the jurisdiction\nof  the\t High Courts in issuing a writ of  certiorari  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 226</a> has been the subject-matter of several decisions of\nthis  Court.  It is now well settled that the said writ\t can\nbe  issued  not\t only  in  case,%  of  illegal\texercise  of\njurisdiction  but also to correct errors of law apparent  on\nthe  face  of  the record.  In this  connection\t it  may  be\npertinent  to  refer to the observations  made\tby  Denning,\nL.J., in Rex v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal  Tribunal\nThe\n(1)  [1952] 1 K.B. 338.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">228</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"568069\" id=\"span_8\">writ  has been supposed to be confined to the correction  of\nexcess of jurisdiction&quot;, observed Lord Justice Denning, &quot;and\nnot  to\t extend\t to the correction of  errors  of  law;\t and\nseveral\t judges\t have  said as much.   But  the\t Lord  Chief\nJustice has, in the present case, restored certiorari to its\nrightful  position and shown that it can be used to  correct\nerrors\tof law which appear on the face of the\trecord\teven\nthough\tthey do not go to jurisdiction&quot;.  There is no  doubt\nthat it is only errors of law which are apparent on the face\nof  the\t record that can be corrected, and errors  of  fact,\nthough\tthey  may  be apparent on the face  of\tthe  record,\ncannot\tbe  corrected  [Vide:  <a href=\"/doc/568069/\" id=\"a_16\">Nagendra\t Nath  Bora  v.\t The\nCommissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam</a> (1)].\t  It\nis  unnecessary\t for us to consider in\tthe  present  appeal\nwhether or not a certiorari can issue to correct an error of\nfact on the ground that the impugned finding of fact is\t not\nsupported by any legal evidence.  Thus it would be seen that\nthe  true  legal  position in regard to the  extent  of\t the\nCourt&#x27;s\t jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari  can  be\nstated without much difficulty.\t Difficulty, however, arises\nwhen it is attempted to lay down tests for determining\twhen\nan  error of law can be said to be an error apparent on\t the\nface  of the record.  Sometimes it is said that it  is\tonly\nerrors\twhich  are self-evident, that is to say,  which\t are\nevident without any elaborate examination of the merits that\ncan be corrected, and not those which can be discovered only\nafter an elaborate argument.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1450722\" id=\"span_9\">In a sense it would be correct\nto say that an error of law which can be corrected by a writ\nof certiorari must be self-evident; that is what is meant by\nsaying\tit is an error apparent on the face of\tthe  record,\nand from that point of view, the test that the error  should\nbe self-evident and should not need an elaborate examination\nof  the\t record may be satisfactory as a working test  in  a\nlarge  majority of cases; but,, as observed  by\t Venkatarama\nAyyar, J., in <a href=\"/doc/1450722/\" id=\"a_17\">Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque</a>,\t (2)\n&quot;there\tmust  be cases in which even this test\tmight  break\ndown  because  judicial opinions also differ, and  an  error\nthat may be considered by one\n (1) [1958] S.C.R. 1240.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104, 1123.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">229</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">judge  as  self-evident\t might\tnot  be\t so  considered\t  by\nanother&quot;.  Judicial experience, however, shows that,  though\nit  cannot be easy to lay down an unfailing test of  general\napplication  it is usually not difficult to  decide  whether\nthe  impugned error of law is apparent. on the face  of\t the\nrecord or not.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">What  then is the error apparent on the face of the(  record\nwhich  the  High Court has corrected by issuing\t a  writ  of\ncertiorari in the present case?\t According to the High Court\nthe construction placed by the appellate authority on cls. 2\nand 5 of the agreement is patently and manifestly erroneous.\nThe  appellate authority held on a construction of the\tsaid\ntwo  clauses  that cl. 2 was the determinative\tclause,\t and\nthat  unless an employee satisfied the requirements  of\t the\nsaid  clause  he could not claim the benefit of\t cl.  5.  In\ndeciding whether the High Court should have issued the\twrit\nor not it is necessary to examine the said two clauses.\t  On\nlooking\t at  the  two  clauses\tit  seems  to  us  that\t the\nconclusion  is inescapable that the error committed  by\t the\nappellate  authority  is  manifest and\tobvious.   Clause  2\napplies\t to clerks employed in the local mills, and as\tsuch\nit describes the nature of the work which is required to  be\ndone by persons falling under that clause.  Clause 5, on the\nother  hand,  obviously provides for a\tseparate  scale\t for\nthose employees who are not clerks nor operatives; these em-\nployees occupied a position higher than that of an operative\nand below that of a full-fledged clerk.\t Therefore there  is\nno doubt that persons falling under cl. 5 cannot fall  under\nel.  2, and should not therefore be expected to satisfy\t the\ntest  prescribed by the said clause.  A bare perusal of\t the\nlist of employees specified by designation as falling  under\nel.  5 will show that the application of the test  which  is\nrelevant  under\t el.  2\t would\tin  their  case\t be   wholly\ninappropriate  and irrelevant.\tTherefore, in  our  opinion,\nthe error committed by the appellate authority was of such a\nmanifest  character  that the High Court  was  justified  in\ncorrecting  the\t said  error  by the  issue  of\t a  writ  of\ncertiorari.   The question involved in the decision  of\t the\ndispute is not so much of construction of the document as of\ngiving effect to the plain terms of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">230</span>\ndocument.   If el. 5 expressly provides for employees  ,,not\nfalling\t under el. 2, and if that intention is clarified  by\nthe list of designations which fall under el. 5 and yet\t the\nappellate  authority reads that clause as subject to cl.  2,\nthat must be regarded as an error patent on the face of\t the\nrecord.\t It is not a case where two alternative\t conclusions\nare  possible; it is a case of plain misreading of  the\t two\nprovisions  ignoring altogether the very object\t with  which\nthe  two  separate provisions were made.   In  our  opinion,\ntherefore,  the contention raised by the  learned  Attorney-\nGeneral that by issuing the writ the High Court has exceeded\nits jurisdiction is not well-founded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">That  takes  us to the second, and in  fact  the  principal,\ncontention which has been seriously argued before us by\t the\nlearned\t Attorney-General.  He urged that  the\tapplications\nmade  by  the  respondents&#x27; Union on  behalf  of  the  three\nemployees  were incompetent under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_18\"> s. 15</a> of the Act  and\t the\nauthority  exceeded its jurisdiction in\t entertaining  them.\nIt is true that this point was not specifically urged before\nthe authority, but it appears to have been argued before the\nappellate  authority  and  the High Court, and\tit  is\tthis\ncontention  which raises the problem of construing<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_19\"> s. 15</a>  of\nthe   Act.   The  case\tfor  the  appellant  is\t  that\t the\njurisdiction  conferred\t on the authority under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_20\"> s. 15</a>  is  a\nlimited jurisdiction, and it would be unreasonable to extend\nit on any inferential ground or by implication.\nThe  scheme  of the Act is clear.  <a href=\"/doc/794158/\" id=\"a_21\">The Act</a> was\tintended  to\nregulate the payment of wages to certain classes of  persons\nemployed  in  industry, and its object is to provide  for  a\nspeedy\tand effective remedy to the employees in respect  of\ntheir\tclaims\tarising\t out.  of  illegal   deductions\t  or\nunjustified  delay made in paying wages to them.  With\tthat\nobject<a href=\"/doc/175319215/\" id=\"a_22\">\ts.  2(vi)</a> of the Act has defined wages.\t  <a href=\"/doc/915487/\" id=\"a_23\">Section  4</a>\nfixes  the  wage period.  <a href=\"/doc/1624119/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 5</a> prescribes the  time  of\npayment\t of  wages;  and  s.  7\t allows\t certain   specified\ndeductions  to be made.\t <a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 15</a> confers jurisdiction  on\nthe  authority appointed under the said section to hear\t and\ndecide\tfor  any  specified  area  claims  arising  out\t  of\ndeductions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">231</span>\nfrom  wages,  or  delay\t in payment  of\t wages,\t of  persons\nemployed  or paid in that area.\t It is thus clear  that\t the\nonly  claims which can be entertained by the  authority\t are\nclaims arising out of deductions or delay made in payment of   wages.  The\n jurisdiction thus conferred on the  authority\nto  deal with these two categories of claims  is  exclusive;\nfor<a href=\"/doc/1939183/\" id=\"a_26\"> s. 22</a> of the Act provides that matters which lie  within\nthe  jurisdiction&#x27;  of the authority are excluded  from\t the\njurisdiction  of ordinary civil courts.\t Thus in  one  sense\nthe jurisdiction conferred on the authority is limited by s.\n15, and in another sense it is exclusive as prescribed by s.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">22.\nIn  dealing with claims arising out of deductions  or  delay\nmade in payment of wages the authority inevitably would have\nto  consider questions incidental to the said  matters.\t  In\ndetermining  the  scope of these incidental  questions\tcare\nmust  be  taken\t to see that under  the\t guise\tof  deciding\nincidental   matters   the  limited  jurisdiction   is\t not\nunreasonably or unduly extended.  Care must also be taken to\nsee  that  the scope of these incidental  questions  is\t not\nunduly\tlimited\t so  as\t to affect  or\timpair\tthe  limited\njurisdiction conferred on the authority.  While\t considering\nthe  question  as to what could be  reasonably\tregarded  as\nincidental  questions  let us revert to\t the  definition  of\nwages  prescribed  by<a href=\"/doc/175319215/\" id=\"a_27\"> s. 2(vi)</a>.\t <a href=\"/doc/175319215/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 2(vi)</a>\tas  it\tthen\nstood\tprovided,  inter  alia,\t that  &#x27;wages&#x27;\t means\t all\nremuneration  capable of being expressed in terms  of  money\nwhich  would,  if the terms of the contract  of\t employment,\nexpress\t or implied, were fulfilled, be payable to a  person\nemployed  in  respect of his employment or of work  done  in\nsuch  employment,  and\tit  includes  any  bonus  or   other\nadditional remuneration of the nature aforesaid which  would\nbe  so payable and any sum payable to such person by  reason\nof the termination of his employment.  It also provided that\nthe  word  &quot;wages&quot; did not include five\t kinds\tof  payments\nspecified in clauses (a) to (e).  Now, if a claim is made by\nan  employee on the ground of alleged illegal  deduction  or\nalleged\t delay\tin payment of wages several  relevant  facts\nwould  fall to be considered.  Is the applicant an  employee\nof the opponent?;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">232</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15288\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"487489\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199139\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"679996\" id=\"span_17\">and  that refers to the subsistence of the relation  between\nthe  employer  and  the\t employee.   If\t the  said  fact  is\nadmitted,  then\t the next question would be:  what  are\t the\nterms of employment?  Is there any contract of employment in\nwriting or is the contract oral?  If that is not a point  of\ndispute\t between the parties then it would be  necessary  to\nenquire\t what  are the terms of the admitted  contract.\t  In\nsome  cases a question may arise whether the contract  which\nwas  subsisting\t at one time had ceased to subsist  and\t the\nrelationship of employer and employee had come to an end  at\nthe  relevant period.  In regard to an illegal\tdeduction  a\nquestion  may  arise whether the lock-out  declared  by\t the\nemployer  is  legal or illegal.\t In regard to  contracts  of\nservice some times parties may be at variance and may set up\nrival  contracts, and in such a case it may be necessary  to\nenquire\t which\tcontract was in existence  at  the  relevant\ntime.\tSome  of  these\t questions have\t in  fact  been\t the\nsubject-matter of judicial decisions. (Vide: <a href=\"/doc/679996/\" id=\"a_29\">A. R. Sarin  v.\nB. C. Patil</a> (<a href=\"/doc/199139/\" id=\"a_30\">1), Vishwanath Tukaram v.

Collector of Pali</a> (5)); but we do not propose\nto consider these possible questions in the present  appeal,\nbecause, in our opinion, it would be inexpedient to lay down\nany  hard  and\tfast or general rule which  would  afford  a\ndetermining test to demarcate the field of incidental  facts\nwhich  can be legitimately considered by the  authority\t and\nthose which cannot be so considered.  We propose to  confine\nour decision to the facts in the present case.\nWhat are the facts in the present case?\t The relationship of\nemployer  and  employee is not in dispute.  It\tis  admitted\nthat the three workmen are employed by the appellant, and do\nthe  work of bleach-folders.  These folders  are  classified\ninto  Uttarnars and Chadhavnars.  Indeed, the items of\twork\nassigned  to these categories of folders are admitted.\t The\nappellant contends that the employment of the three  workmen\nis governed by the Award which is in operation,\n(1) (1951) 53 Bom.  L.R. 674.  (2) [1957] Bom.L.R. 892.\n(3) [1960] 11 L.L.J. 364.</span></span></span></span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">233</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">whereas the respondent Union contends that they are governed\nby  cl. 5 of the subsequent agreement.\tIt is common  ground\nthat  both the Award and the agreement are in  operation  in\nrespect\t of  the persons governed respectively by  them,  so\nthat  it is not disputed by the appellant that\tthe  persons\nwho are specified by their designation under cl. 5 would  be\nentitled to, the benefit of the said clause and would not be\ngoverned  by  the Award.  If an employee is called  a  cut--\nlooker\tby any mill he would naturally fall under cl. 5;  in\nother words, all the specified categories of employees named\nby  designation in that clause would not be governed by\t the\nAward  though at one stage they were treated  as  operatives\nbut they would be governed by cl. 5 of the agreement; and if\na person bearing that designation applied under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_33\"> s. 15</a> of the\nAct  his  application would be competent.   The\t appellant&#x27;s\nargument,  however,  is\t that when the last part  of  el.  5\nrefers to other employees &quot;who have not been included  above\nbut  who  can  properly fall under the\tabove  category&quot;  no\ndesignation is attached to that class, and in such a case it\nwould be necessary to enquire whether a particular  employee\ncan  properly fall under the said category, and that, it  is\nurged, means that such an employee cannot apply under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_34\"> s.  15</a>\nbut  must  go  to the industrial court\tunder  the  ordinary\nindustrial  law.  Thus the controversy between\tthe  parties\nlies  within a very narrow compass.  An employee  designated\nas a cut-looker can apply under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_35\"> s. 15</a> and obtain relief from\nthe  authority;\t an employee not so designated\tbut  falling\nunder  the said category by virtue of the work\tassigned  to\nhim,  it  is  said, cannot apply under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_36\">\ts.  15</a>\tbecause\t the\nauthority  cannot deal with the question as to\twhether\t the\nsaid employee properly falls under the said category or not.\nIn our opinion, on these facts, the question as to whether a\nparticular employee is an operative falling under the  Award\nor one who is above an operative and below the clerk falling\nunder  cl.  5  is  a question which  is\t so  intimately\t and\nintegrally  connected with the problem of wages\t as  defined\nunder<a href=\"/doc/175319215/\" id=\"a_37\"> s. 2(vi)</a> that it would be unreasonable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">30</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">234</span>\nto  exclude  the  decision  of\tsuch  a\t question  from\t the\njurisdiction of the authority under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_38\"> s. 15</a>.  If a contract of\nemployment  is\tadmitted and there is a\t dispute  about\t the\nconstruction of its terms, that obviously falls within<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_39\"> s. 15</a>\nof  the\t Act.\tIf that is so, what  is\t the  difference  in\nprinciple where a contract is admitted, its terms are not in\ndispute,  and the only point in dispute is which of the\t two\nsubsisting  contracts applies to the particular employee  in\nquestion.   If the appellant&#x27;s argument were to\t prevail  it\nwould  lead  to this anomalous position that  if  a  general\ncontract  of  employment provides for payment  of  wages  to\ndifferent  categories  of employees and describes  the\tsaid\ncategories  by reference to the duties discharged  by  them,\nnone  of the employees can ever avail himself of the  speedy\nremedy\tprovided by<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_40\"> s. 15</a> of the Act.  In such a case  every\ntime  a\t dispute may arise about the duties  assigned  to  a\nparticular employee before his wages are determined.  In our\nopinion,  to  place  such an artificial\t limitation  on\t the\nlimits of the jurisdiction conferred on the authority by  s.\n15  is wholly unreasonable.  That is the view taken  by\t the\nHigh  Court  in\t the present case and we see  no  reason  to\ndiffer from it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"999102\" id=\"span_21\">The  question  about  the nature and scope  of\tthe  limited\njurisdiction conferred on the authority under<a href=\"/doc/1106018/\" id=\"a_41\"> s. 15</a> has been\nconsidered by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/999102/\" id=\"a_42\">A.
