Despite execution of the discharge voucher, the\n                             consumer may be in a position to satisfy the Tribunal or the\n                             Commission under the Act that such discharge voucher or receipt\n                             had been obtained from him under the circumstances which can be\n                             termed as fraudulent or exercise of undue influence or by\n                             misrepresentation or the like. If in a given case the consumer\n                             satisfies the authority under the Act that the discharge voucher was\n                             obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, undue influence or the like,\n                             coercive bargaining compelled by circumstances, the authority\n                             before whom the complaint is made would be justified in granting\n                             appropriate relief. However (sic so), where such discharge voucher\n                             is proved to have been obtained under any of the suspicious\n                             circumstances noted hereinabove, the Tribunal or the commission\n                             would be justified in granting the appropriate relief under the\n                             circumstances of each case.

In the absence of pleadings and evidence the State\n                           Commission was justified in dismissing their complaints. The\n                           National Commission however granted relief solely on the ground\n                           of delay in the settlement of claim under the policies. The mere\n                           delay of a couple of months would not have authorised the\n                           National Commission to grant relief particularly when the insurer\n                           had not complained of such a delay at the time of acceptance of the\n                           insurance amount under the policy.

On NTPC not doing so,\n                    Reshmi invoked arbitration. The request for referring the dispute to\n                    arbitration was not outrightly rejected by NTPC.

The respondent herein, as noticed hereinbefore,\n                            categorically stated in its letter dated 20-12-1990 as to under what\n                            circumstances they were compelled to sign the said printed letter.

Even when rights and obligations of the parties are worked\n                           out, the contract does not come to an end inter alia for the purpose of\n                           determination of the disputes arising thereunder, and, thus, the\n                           arbitration agreement can be invoked. Although it may not be strictly\n                           in place but we cannot shut our eyes to the ground reality that in a\n                           case where a contractor has made huge investment, he cannot afford\n                           not to take from the employer the amount under the bills, for various\n                           reasons which may include discharge of his liability towards the\n                           banks, financial institutions and other persons. In such a situation, the\n                           public sector undertakings would have an upper hand. They would not\n                           ordinarily release the money unless a &quot;No-Demand Certificate&quot; is\n                           signed.

A glance at the said clause will immediately indicate that a\n                           no-claim certificate is required to be submitted by a contractor\n                           once the works are finally measured up.

On the other hand, even the first\n                           arbitrator, who had been appointed, had come to a finding that no-\n                           claim certificate had been given under coercion and duress.

NIC sent\n                    the format of the discharge voucher to Boghara which, owing to the\n                    dire financial condition in which it was placed, it had no option but to\n                    sign it and send it back. Payment was released to Boghara by NIC\n                    only after the signed undated discharge voucher was received back by\n                    NIC.

Obtaining of undated receipts-in-advance in regard to\n                           regular/routine payments by government departments and corporate\n                           sector is an accepted practice which has come to stay due to\n                           administrative exigencies and accounting necessities. The reason for\n                           insisting upon undated voucher/receipt is that as on the date of\n                           execution of such voucher/receipt, payment is not made. The payment\n                           is made only on a future date long after obtaining the receipt. If the\n                           date of execution of the receipt is mentioned in the receipt and the\n                           payment is released long thereafter, the receipt acknowledging the\n                           amount as having been received on a much earlier date will be absurd\n                           and meaningless. Therefore, undated receipts are taken so that it can\n                           be used in respect of subsequent payments by incorporating the\n                           appropriate date.

In both these decisions, the\n                    Supreme Court held that the High Court ought to have rejected the\n                    request for referring the dispute to arbitration by properly examining\n                    whether the debt stood discharge by accord and satisfaction. Had it\n                    done so, the Supreme Court holds, in both these decisions, that the\n                    High Court would have found that the debt had indeed been\n                    discharged and that, therefore, no arbitrable dispute survived.

The position in law\n                    as it exists today is that a <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 11</a> Court cannot examine anything\n                    except the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties\n                    and whether the <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 11</a> petition has been filed within three years\n                    of the <a href=\"/doc/86602/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 21</a> notice.

Nonetheless, these decisions reiterate the principles regarding\n                    discharge of debts by accord and satisfaction, consequent on the\n                    furnishing of a discharge voucher or a NCC and, to that extent, are\n                    relevant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_108\">                    64.      In ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals, the final bill of the\n                    contractor was paid 20 days after the contractor furnished a no dues/\n                    no claim certificate, certifying payment of all bills and in total\n                    settlement of the contractor&#x27;s claims under the contract.

Thereafter, the\n                    contractor sent a notice to the employer for resolving the disputes by\n                    arbitration. On the employer refusing to do so, the contractor\n                    approached the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act. The\n                    High Court allowed the petition.

This decision broadly reiterates the principles contained in the\n                    authorities cited in this judgment. Before the Supreme Court, the\n                    employer sought to contend that by virtue of the no dues certificate\n                    issued by the contractor, the contract had come to an end and all\n                    obligations thereunder stood discharged. No arbitral disputes therefore\n                    survived.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">                    67.     The Supreme Court after referring to earlier decisions,\n                    including Boghara Polyfab, held that the party approaching the Court\n                    under <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 11</a> could not content itself by raising a bald plea of\n                    fraud, duress or undue influence and was required to prima facie\n                    examine the existences of these factors by plying material before this\n                    Court. The principle that applied was thus stated in para 25 of the\n                    report:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">                           &quot;25.     When we refer to discharge of a contract by an agreement\n                           signed by both the parties or by execution of a full and final discharge\n                           voucher/receipt by one of the parties, we refer to an agreement or\n                           discharge voucher which is validly and voluntarily executed. If the\n                           party which has executed the discharge agreement or discharge\n                           voucher, alleges that the execution of such discharge agreement or\n                           voucher was on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence practised\n                           by the other party and is able to establish the same, then obviously the\n                           discharge of the contract by such agreement/voucher is rendered void\n                           and cannot be acted upon. Consequently, any dispute raised by such\n                           party would be arbitrable. But in case the party is not able to establish\n                           such a claim or appears to be lacking in credibility, then it is not open\n                           to the courts to refer the dispute to arbitration at all.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">                    68.

The contractee company accepted the final payment in\n                              full and final satisfaction of all its claims. We are of the considered\n                              opinion that in the present facts and circumstances, the raising of\n                              the final bill and mutual agreement of the parties in that regard, all\n                              claims, rights and obligation of the parties merge with the final bill\n                              and nothing further remains to be done. Further, the appellant\n                              contractor issued the completion certificate dated 19-6-2013\n                              pursuant to which the appellant contractor has been discharged of\n                              all the liabilities. With regard to the issue that the &quot;no-dues\n                              certificate&quot; had been given under duress and coercion, we are of\n                              the opinion that there is nothing on record to prove that the said\n                              certificate had been given under duress or coercion and as the\n                              certificate itself provided a clearance of no dues, the contractee\n                              could not now turn around and say that any further payment was\n                              still due on account of the losses incurred during the execution of\n                              the contract. The story about duress was an afterthought in the\n                              background that the losses incurred during the execution of the\n                              contract were not visualised earlier by the contractee.

Thus, the thread that runs through the above decisions is that\n                    submission or tendering of a final discharge voucher, or a no claim\n                    certificate, by the contractor to the employer, is not determinative of\n                    the dispute between them. It is always open to the contractor to\n                    establish that the discharge voucher or NCC was provided under\n                    duress, coercion or economic compulsion. It is only where no such\n                    factors exist and the discharge voucher, or NCC, is found to have been\n                    tendered voluntarily that the contractor would not be permitted to\n                    resile therefrom and raise a belated claim. The Court - or the\n                    arbitrator - is required to take all factors into consideration while\n                    arriving at a decision as to whether the discharge voucher or NCC\n                    had, or had not, been voluntarily tendered. While examining the\n                    aspect of economic duress, the Court, or the Arbitrator, can take into\n                    account the fact that the bills of the contractor may have remained\n                    unpaid, or that the payment, which was certified by the contractor as\n                    being in full and final settlement of his claims, was actually made\n                    after the NCC was issued. Such factors would go to indicate that the\n                    NCC was not voluntarily tendered.</p><pre id=\"pre_20\">\n\n\n                    Two passing observations\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                  O.M.P. 26/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Signature Not Verified                                                            Page 43 of 52 Signature Not Verified</span>\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT                                                                        Digitally Signed\nKUMAR                                                                                           By:CHANDRASHEKHARAN\n                                                                                                HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Date:26.09.2024                                                                         Signing Date:26.09.2024\n15:16:43                                                                                        15:15:55\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">                     81.    While examining the impact of the decisions cited earlier, on\n                    the issue in controversy, one distinction has to be borne in mind. Most\n                    of the decisions, except Ambica Constructions, relate to the issue of\n                    whether the dispute ought, or ought not, to have been referred to\n                    arbitration. The appeal to the Supreme Court arose out of a decision of\n                    the High Court either referring the disputes to arbitration or refusing\n                    to refer the dispute under <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act. Ambica\n                    Constructions is the only case in which the controversy arose out of\n                    an arbitral award in a Section 34 challenge - as in the present case. It\n                    is important to note this distinction for the simple reason that the\n                    scope of enquiry by the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 11</a> and under Section 34\n                    is radically different. Even at the time of rendition of the above\n                    decisions, the <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 11</a> Court was only required to satisfy itself as to\n                    whether there existed an arbitration agreement and whether there\n                    existed an arbitrable dispute. With the recent decision in SBI General\n                    Insurance, the <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 11(6)</a> Court is not entitled to enquire into the\n                    latter aspect and has to satisfy itself by examining whether there exists\n                    an arbitration agreement between the parties. Even at the time of the\n                    rendition of the decisions cited supra, which was in the pre-SBI\n                    General Insurance era, the Court was only concerned with whether\n                    an arbitrable dispute existed. The decisions hold that if there was any\n                    scope for enquiring into whether the NCC or discharge voucher had\n                    been furnished under duress or coercion, then irrespective of the\n                    merits of the challenge, the dispute had to be referred to arbitration.\n                    Where however, the challenge was found to be a complete after-\n                    thought with no supportive material whatsoever to indicate that there\n                    was any economic duress or coercion which vitiated the NCC or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                  O.M.P. 26/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">Signature Not Verified                                                             Page 44 of 52 Signature Not Verified</span>\nDigitally Signed By:AJIT                                                                         Digitally Signed\nKUMAR                                                                                            By:CHANDRASHEKHARAN\n                                                                                                 HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Date:26.09.2024                                                                          Signing Date:26.09.2024\n15:16:43                                                                                         15:15:55\n                     discharge voucher, the Court could refuse to refer the disputes to\n                    arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">                    82.     Which brings us to the second aspect. We are, however, in the\n                    present case, not at the <a href=\"/doc/1094200/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 11</a> stage. The disputes stand referred\n                    and an arbitral award stands rendered. The challenge before this Court\n                    is a challenge under Section 34 to the arbitral award. The limits of\n                    Section 34 jurisdiction are well known. The issue of whether the facts\n                    before the Arbitral Tribunal made out a case of economic duress,\n                    coercion or compulsion, under which the NCC was furnished by the\n                    respondent, was clearly a question of fact. The finding of the Arbitral\n                    Tribunal in that regard is also a finding of fact. The scope of\n                    interference by the Court under Section 34 of the 1996 Act, with\n                    findings of fact rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal, is all but\n                    completely foreclosed. It is only where the &quot;finding of fact is arrived\n                    at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into\n                    consideration irrelevant material or if the finding so outrageously\n                    defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality incurring the\n                    blame of being perverse&quot;, then, the finding, merits intervention under\n                    Section 34 as being &quot;perverse&quot;.41\n\n\n                    Applying the above principles\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">                    83.     When one applies the above principles to the present case, it is\n                    obvious that no scope for interference with the decision of the learned\n                    Arbitrator on the plea of accord and satisfaction can be said to exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_139\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"33194097\" id=\"span_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_108\">41 <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_58\">Associate Builders v DDA</a>, (2015) 3 SCC 49; <a href=\"/doc/33194097/\" id=\"a_59\">Konkan Railway Corporation v Chenab Bridge Project\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                  O.M.P. 26/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">Signature Not Verified                                                                                  Page 45 of 52 Signature Not Verified</span>\nDigitally Signed By</a>:AJIT                                                                                               Digitally Signed\nKUMAR                                                                                                                  By:CHANDRASHEKHARAN\n                                                                                                                       HARI SHANKAR\nSigning Date:26.09.2024                                                                                                Signing Date:26.09.2024\n15:16:43                                                                                                               15:15:55\n                     The learned Arbitrator has held that the measurements recorded in the\n                    Measurement Books did not include the items for which the claims\n                    were raised during execution of the contract. The NCC was undated\n                    and on a routine pre-printed form. Most importantly, the final bill,\n                    regarding which the NCC had been issued, was itself raised only after\n                    the NCC was submitted. The NCC was submitted on 11 October\n                    2003, the final bill was raised on 13 October 2003 and was paid on 3\n                    November 2003. The amount in relation to which the NCC was issued\n                    was substantially less than the amount covered by the final bill.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">                    84.      In these circumstances, the decision of the learned Arbitrator\n                    that the submission of the NCC was under economic pressure and\n                    coercion, and necessitated because of withholding of the processing\n                    and payment of the petitioner&#x27;s bills, cannot be said to suffer from any\n                    error of perception much less can it be said to be perverse or shocking\n                    to the conscience of the Court. At the very least, it is a plausible\n                    view, on the facts which were before the learned Arbitrator.

The\n                    Supreme Court has authoritatively laid down the law in this regard in\n                    <a href=\"/doc/22538804/\" id=\"a_60\">UOI v Manraj Enterprises42</a>. That case dealt with the very same\n                    clause 16(2) of the GCC, with which we are concerned. The sole\n                    argument raised by the respondent, to counter Mr. Tiwari&#x27;s\n                    submission that the learned Arbitrator, could not have awarded\n                    interest, is that the words &quot;or any other amounts payable to the\n                    contractor under the contract&quot; have to be read ejusdem generis with\n                    the words &quot;earnest money deposit&quot; and &quot;security deposit&quot;. Thus read,\n                    interest on damages which are awarded by the Arbitrator would not\n                    fall within the proscription of Clause 16(2).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">                    88.
