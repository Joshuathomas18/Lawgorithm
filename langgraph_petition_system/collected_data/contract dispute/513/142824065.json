Senior counsel submits that, in effect, what\n                                Gujarat Gas is seeking today is enforcement of its purported right to\n                                purchase gas from Vedanta under the MGSC/GSC, the grant of\n                                which, at this interim stage, would amount to granting specific\n                                performance of contract as an interim measure of protection.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">                          30.

Senior counsel submits that\n                                this provision was specifically dropped since it is now the law, that a\n                                contract is specifically enforceable even if damages may be adequate\n                                relief for its non-performance.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">By:SUNITA RAWAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Signing Date:12.05.2022   O.M.P (I) (COMM) 125/2022                                       Page 17 of 24</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">14:19:39</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\">                           32.

The fact\n                                                that this arrangement was not within the scope of the MGSC is\n                                                evident inter-alia from the very „subject‟ of e-mail dated\n                                                13.11.2020 and from the contents of that e-mail, which\n                                                specified that a monthly DCQ letter will be sent to Gujarat Gas\n                                                30 days in advance; and Gujarat Gas officials were required to\n                                                confirm acceptance of the increased DCQ under this\n                                                arrangement, among other things.
