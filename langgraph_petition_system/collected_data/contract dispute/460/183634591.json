The petitioner was required to complete\nthe contract works within 32 months from the commencement\ndate stipulated in the LOA.

On 31st May 2019, the petitioner also issued the\nnotice inviting the respondent for conciliation under Clause\n17.6 of the general conditions of contract.

It is stated that for constitution of\nthe arbitral tribunal in accordance with law, in its notice of\narbitration the petitioner informed the respondent that the\nparties may appoint their respective nominee arbitrators who\ncan then appoint the presiding arbitrator.

Learned       counsel      for       the   petitioner            further\nsubmitted that since the respondent failed to certify its claim\nwithin the stipulated time and did not accept the notice for\nconciliation, the petitioner issued the notice of arbitration to\nthe respondent on 08.07.2019. Clause 17.9 contemplates\nappointment of a three member arbitral tribunal, if claim is\nmore than Rs.5 million. However, the remaining procedure\nwhich provides for appointment of the tribunal from a panel of\nfive members provided by the respondent, which may also\ninclude the respondent&#x27;s officers, is not a valid procedure in\nlaw. Clause 17.9 restricts/limits the right of the petitioner to\nchoose its arbitrator only from the panel prepared and\nforwarded by the respondent, and that extent, clause 17.9 is\ninvalid    and      unenforceable.        Further,       as      per        law,     the\nrespondent cannot have a unilateral right to furnish a penal\nfor appointment of an arbitrator. The petitioner has complied\nwith procedural requirements of the dispute resolution clause\nunder the contract bu the petitioner and the respondent\nmerely disagree on the validity and interpretation of the said\nclause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.            Learned       counsel      for       the   petitioner            further\nsubmitted that <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                   Page 6 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                              Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">          C/IAAP/119/2019                                            ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\nAct, 1996 has been amended with the objective to induce\nneutrality     of     arbitrators      viz.        their   independence             and\nimpartiality. The amended provision is enacted to identify the\ncircumstances which give rise to justifiable doubts about the\nindependence or impartiality of the arbitrator. If any of those\ncircumstances as mentioned there exists, it will give rise to\njustifiable apprehension of bias. The fifth schedule of the Act\nenumerates the grounds which may give rise to justifiable\ndoubts of this nature. Likewise, seventh schedule mentions\nthose circumstances which would attract the provisions of\nsubsection 5 of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_5\">section 12</a> and nullify and prior agreement to\nthe contrary. If an arbitrator is an employee, a consultant, an\nadvisor or has any past or present business relationship with a\nparty, he is rendered ineligible to act as an arbitrator.\nLikewise, a person is treated as incompetent to perform the\nrole of arbitrator, who is a manager, director or part of the\nmanagement or has a single controlling influence in an\naffiliate of one of the parties if the affiliate is directly involved\nin the matters in dispute in the arbitration. Likewise, persons\nwho regularly advise the appointing party or affiliate of the\nappointing party are incapacitated. In view of the above,\nclause 17.9 of the Agreement is invalid. In view of the\ninvalidity of clause 17.9, the dispute cannot be adjudicated by\nappointment of arbitrators as contemplated therein, but the\narbitrators would have to be independently appointed and the\nprocess adopted by the petitioner is appropriate and legal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.           Learned       counsel        for       the    petitioner         further\nsubmitted that for the constitution of the arbitral tribunal in\naccordance with law, in its notice of arbitration, the petitioner\ninformed the respondent that the parties may appoint their\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                    Page 7 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                             Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">            C/IAAP/119/2019                               ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\nrespective nominee arbitrators who can then appoint the\npresiding arbitrator.

Firstly,   on       facts,    there    is   a\n   material distinction between the present case\n   and the Voestalpine case. In the said case, as\n   evident        from    the     observations         made        at\n   paragraph 2, read with 8 and 13 of the\n   judgment, the Respondent therein had itself\n   maintained a panel of 31 arbitrators, out of\n   which, in terms of the relevant arbitration\n   clause, it was to forward names of five persons\n   to the Petitioner therein. In the instant case,\n   the Respondent has not maintained any broad\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                           Page 15 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                       Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\"> C/IAAP/119/2019                                                  ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n   based panel of arbitrators, which would have\n   been known to the Petitioner at the time of\n   execution of the contract under dispute. In\n   fact, even the names comprising of the panel\n   of five arbitrators, came to be disclosed to the\n   Petitioner, only in the reply filed by the\n   Respondent in November, 2019, to the subject\n   petition. Secondly, while in the aforesaid\n   peculiar facts, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n   permitted the Petitioner therein to nominate\n   any      person         from        the     entire    panel       of\n   arbitrators, observing in the same breath that\n   a panel should, &quot;apart from serving or retired\n   engineers of government departments and\n   public         sector      undertakings,        engineers         of\n   prominence and high repute from private\n   sector should also be included. Likewise panel\n   should         comprise        of     persons        with     legal\n   background like Judges and lawyers of repute\n   as it is not necessary that all disputes that\n   arise, would be of technical nature. There can\n   be dispute involving purely or substantially\n   legal issues, that too, complicated in nature.\n   Likewise,         some       disputes        may      have      the\n   dimension of accountancy, etc. therefore, it\n   would also be appropriate to include person\n   from      this     filed    as      well&quot;.    However,        fully\n   approving the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble\n   Supreme          Court      as      regards     neutrality        of\n   arbitrators        and       their         independence        and\n   impartiality, made in the Voestalpine case, the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                              Page 16 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                                          Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\"> C/IAAP/119/2019                                                     ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n   Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of Perkins\n   went further to effectively disentitle a person\n   who has an interest in the outcome or decision\n   of the dispute, to have any power of appointing\n   arbitrators.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155925871\" id=\"span_53\">8.

The Respondent has further submitted\n   that its autonomy as to appointment of the\n   Arbitrators, has to be respected. In this\n   context, it is submitted that party autonomy\n   cannot be exercised in disregard of the\n   principles of impartiality and independence.\n   The spirit of amending <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 12</a> is to provide\n   for neutrality of arbitrators if an arbitration\n   clause is found to be contrary to this spirit,\n   appointment              of        arbitrators         beyond      the\n   arbitration agreement is permissible and the\n   Respondent cannot insist for appointment of\n   arbitrators         in        terms       of     the     arbitration\n   agreement. The mere fact that the parties may\n   have           agreed         to     an       unfair     arbitration\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                 Page 17 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                             Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\"> C/IAAP/119/2019                                                   ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n   agreement, is not reason enough, for such a\n   party to be compelled to submit itself to\n   arbitration, before an arbitral tribunal which\n   may       not        inspire     confidence        and        where\n   neutrality is not assured or visible. The instant\n   case is the case where giving a go-by to the\n   agreed arbitration clause is fully justified. In\n   the       circumstances,             nomination          by     the\n   Petitioner of its nominee arbitrator was fully\n   justified and in accordance with law. The very\n   decision in the case of Voestalpine relied upon\n   by             the      Respondent,            notes            the\n   recommendations of the Law Commission on\n   the issue of neutrality of arbitrators to the\n   effect that the principals of impartiality and\n   independence cannot be disregarded at any\n   stage of the proceedings and that it would be\n   incongruous to say that party autonomy can be\n   exercised in disregard of these principles even\n   if the same has been agreed prior to the\n   dispute having arisen. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n   Court in the said case of Voestalpine itself\n   noted and observed that in a number of\n   judgments             the      courts       have    appointed\n   arbitrators giving a go-by to the agreed\n   arbitration clause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">   10.

As against that, in the\ninstant case, as it is submitted by the petitioner and not\ncontroverted by the respondent that for the first time the five\nnames in the panel were disclosed in the reply affidavit in the\npresent proceedings by the respondent and therefore it can\nwell be said that the parties were not ad idem when the\ncontract was being executed qua the selection of panel or\nselection of arbitrators for adjudicating the dispute under the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                               Page 33 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                           Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">         C/IAAP/119/2019                               ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_42\">Arbitration Act</a> and one need not loose sight of\nthe fact that the counsel for the petitioner also invited Court&#x27;s\nattention to the observations of the Supreme Court in the\naforesaid case, wherein the Court did observe that apart from\nserving and retired engineers of Government Departments,\nthe prominent and reputed engineers of private sector should\nbe included and the persons with legal background like\nJudges and Lawyers of repute be included, as it is not always\nthat the dispute would contain only technical aspect.

It was contended that the\nproceedings will have to be proceeded in accordance with the\npre-amended provision of the Act of 1996 and it was\ncontended that the High Court erred in appointing an\nindependent arbitrator instead of directing the General\nManager, Railway Administration to appoint an arbitrator as\nper the terms and conditions of clause 64 of GCC which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                            Page 34 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                               Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">         C/IAAP/119/2019                                ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nstipulated &quot;accepted matters&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"183939473\" id=\"span_133\">The said judgment thereafter\ncontain extract of the observation of the Court in <a href=\"/doc/183939473/\" id=\"a_48\">S.P.

In the instant case, it is required to be noted\nthat the provision of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 12</a> read with Schedule 5 and 7 is\na provision indicating that how and in what manner the\nneutrality in the arbitrators are to be of paramount concern\nand therefore, the clauses and arbitration contract will have\nto be strictly in consonance therewith.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"155925871\" id=\"span_134\">In the instant case,\ntherefore, when the said provision is followed and the\narbitrators&#x27; panel which had never been disclosed while the\ncontract was being executed, then in light of the observation\nof the Supreme Court judgment in case of <a href=\"/doc/155925871/\" id=\"a_50\">Perkins Eastman\nArchitects DPC</a> (supra) it can well be said that the petitioner\ndid have a right to nominate his own arbitrator likewise\npetitioner was not required to call for the panel of arbitrators\nwhich on the face of it would not be in consonance with the\nprovision cited hereinabove. The procedure for appointment is\nrequired to be followed and therefore the so called right of the\nrespondent in suggesting five persons&#x27; name, decision of\nwhich the petitioner is essentially required to choose one\nname who will act as an arbitrator and one name will be\nchosen by the employer and those two will have no other go\nbut to appoint the 3rd arbitrator. Decision of the panel in itself\nwould indicate that there is virtually no choice and freedom\nleft to the petitioner for making appointment, which in my\nconsidered opinion, would be contrary to the provision of\n<a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 12</a> and therefore, the clause 17.9 of the contract will\nhave to be made operational whereunder both the parties may\nhave liberty to appoint their respective arbitrators and those\narbitrators in turn would appoint third arbitrator.</span>\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                            Page 35 of 36</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                                Downloaded on : Sat Feb 01 02:46:39 IST 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">          C/IAAP/119/2019                                  ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">25.
