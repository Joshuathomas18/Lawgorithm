The present suit has been filed by the plaintiff for recovery of an\namount of Rs.74,32,700/- against the defendants. Defendant No.1 is\na company incorporated in Switzerland that is carrying on business in\nIndia through defendant No.2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.     Brief facts of the case as per the plaint are that defendants\nmade a sales offer to the plaintiff bearing No.S-6097-08 dated 15th\nJanuary, 2009 for the sale of 200 MT of Secondary Aluminium Alloy\nADC 12 ingots. The said sales offer was accepted by the plaintiff as\nper the terms and conditions as contained in the purchase contract\ndated 16th January, 2009 bearing No.CMML/08-09/136. In pursuance\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                           Page 1 of 41</span>\n of the said contract, the defendants supplied the goods, however,\nthere were certain objections with regard to the quality specification\nwhich were conveyed to the defendants vide complaints dated 13th\nMarch, 2009 and 23rd March, 2009.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.     Subsequently, the defendants sent another sale offer bearing\nNo.6429-09 dated 20th January, 2009 to the plaintiff for the supply of\n200 MT of Secondary Aluminium Alloy ADC 12 ingots of a particular\nspecification. The said sales offer was accepted by the plaintiff as per\nthe terms and conditions of the purchase contract bearing No.\nCMML/08-09/146 dated 22nd January, 2009. Again the goods were\nsupplied to the plaintiff who had certain objections with regard to the\nquality specification. The same were conveyed to the defendants vide\ncomplaint dated 6th March, 2009 along with a test report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.     It has been stated by the plaintiff that pursuant to the said\ncomplaint, defendants appointed an independent surveying agency\nfor inspecting the goods. On inspection, sample of the goods were\nsent to a testing laboratory wherein it was found out that material did\nnot meet the quality specifications as per the contracts. Thereafter\nplaintiff lodged a claim of $ 168,925 in respect of the entire material\nsupplied by the defendants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.     It is the case of the plaintiff that despite lodging the claims and\nmaking repeated reminders and requests, the defendants did not\ntake any action and failed to make any payment thereof. The plaintiff\nsent a legal notice dated 8th June, 2010 to the defendants for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                           Page 2 of 41</span>\n recovering the said amount, while defendants vide notice dated 12th\nJuly, 2010 also raised certain pleas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">6.     This led to filing of the present suit by the plaintiff. The suit was\ncontested by the defendants by filing an application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 8</a>\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to\nas &quot;the Act&quot;) which was contested by the plaintiff stating that <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_2\">Part I of\nthe Act</a> is not applicable to the cases of International Commercial\nArbitration while the said application ought to have been filed under\n<a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 45</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.     During the course of proceedings, defendants filed an\napplication bearing I.A. No.12391/2013 under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 45</a> of the Act\nstating that under the contracts entered into by the parties, there was\nan arbitration clause which provided that all the disputes between the\nparties were to be referred to the London Metal Exchange in London.\nAccordingly, the present Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the\npresent suit and the matter be referred for arbitration under the\nLondon Metal Exchange Rules at London. The arbitration clause\nunder the contracts read as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">       &quot;J)     Arbitration-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">       All disputes and differences which may arise out of this\n       contract are to be submitted to the Rules and\n       Regulations of the LONDON METAL EXCHANGE in\n       London.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.     In reply to the said application the plaintiff contended that while\none sales confirmation bearing No.S-6097-08 dated 15th January,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                             Page 3 of 41</span>\n 2009 is not signed by the plaintiff, the other sales confirmation\nbearing No.6429-09 dated 20th January, 2009 has been signed and\naccepted by the plaintiff as per the terms and conditions of the\npurchase contract bearing No.CMML/08-09/146. The relevant terms\nof the purchase contract is reproduced herein below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;The contract is to be duly signed and faxed to us\n      within three working days from the date hereof, failing\n      which contract terms &amp; conditions will be deemed\n      binding both buyers &amp; Sellers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        Claims, if any, relating to quality/quantity shall be\n      made by us within 15 days after delivery of goods at\n      final destination and the same shall be settled by seller\n      within one month of receipt of claim. All disputes\n      relating to this contract will be subject to the jurisdiction\n      of Courts at New Delhi, India.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">       It is averred by the plaintiff that from the above it is clear that\nthough the offer of the defendants contained arbitration clause but\nthe same was not accepted by the plaintiff and as per the purchase\ncontract all the disputes relating to the contract were subject to the\njurisdiction of the Courts at New Delhi. It was mentioned that if the\nduly signed contract was not sent the terms and conditions of the\npurchase contract would be deemed to be binding totally on the\nbuyers and the sellers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">9.     In the rejoinder, contentions of the plaintiff are denied and the\naverments made in the application are reiterated by the defendants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">10.    By this order I propose to decide the said application bearing\nI.A. No. 12391/2013 of the defendants. When the matter came up for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                             Page 4 of 41</span>\n hearing, Mr.Vipin Singhania, learned counsel appeared on behalf of\nthe plaintiff and Mr.Chetan Sharma, learned Senior counsel appeared\non behalf of the defendants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">11.    Mr.Chetan Sharma, learned Senior counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the defendants made his submissions in support of the\napplication and the same are outlined in the following manner :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">a)    Firstly, learned Senior counsel argued that there were two\n      contracts which were entered into between the parties towards\n      the sale and supply of 200 MT of Secondary Aluminium Alloy\n      ADC 12 ingots. It has been argued that the plaintiff has\n      consciously not filed the sales confirmation which contained the\n      dispute resolution clause that refers the disputes to London\n      Metal Exchange, London. It is stated that plaintiff has filed the\n      amended sales confirmation which was subsequently issued by\n      the defendants with backdate as the plaintiff had subsequently\n      requested for inclusion of the detailed product specification in the\n      sales confirmation dated 15th January, 2009 later in the\n      communication dated 19th January, 2009. Likewise, it has been\n      argued that there was another sales confirmation in the form of\n      second contract dated 20th January, 2009 which was signed by\n      both the parties containing the similar clause &#x27;J&#x27; which is an\n      arbitration clause referring the dispute to London Metal\n      Exchange, London. The plaintiff unilaterally issued a subsequent\n      purchase contract attempting to alter the terms of the concluded\n      contract by conferring the jurisdiction upon the Courts in Delhi\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                           Page 5 of 41</span>\n      which was neither acceded to nor signed by the defendants. It is\n     thus argued that this Court should refer the disputes, if any,\n     between the plaintiff and defendants before the Arbitral Tribunal\n     in London in view of the arbitration clause contained in the form\n     of clause &#x27;J&#x27; and should not proceed with the present suit.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">b)   Secondly, learned Senior counsel argued that the plaintiff&#x27;s basis\n     of filing the suit that there is no valid arbitration agreement\n     between the parties and therefore, this Court can interfere on the\n     basis of the invalidity of the agreement under the provisions of\n     <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 45</a> of the Act, is misplaced and frivolous in nature. It has\n     been argued that there exists the sales confirmation which has\n     been signed by both the parties wherein the arbitration clause is\n     explicitly mentioned. The said sales confirmation which is signed\n     by the parties are not denied by the plaintiff. The plaintiff merely\n     disputes the position by stating that signature has been affixed\n     by him on the sales confirmation subject to the terms and\n     conditions contained in the purchase contract issued by him\n     containing the clause conferring jurisdiction to Delhi Court which\n     is the point required to be determined by the Court. But that\n     apart, there exists an agreement by virtue of the written\n     communication in the form of sales confirmation signed by both\n     the parties and thus it cannot be said that there is no valid\n     contract between the parties. It is argued that the arbitration\n     agreement is in writing in the nature of documents provided\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1534152/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 7 (4)</a> of the Act. The original of the arbitration\n     agreement is not required to be proved when the plaintiff himself\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                          Page 6 of 41</span>\n      signed the sales confirmation and does not deny his signatures\n     on the sales confirmation but merely states that the same were\n     signed under the protest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"123878146\" id=\"span_7\">c)   Learned Senior counsel argued that though the agreement in the\n     form of the sales confirmation has been signed by both the\n     parties, still, the plaintiff relies upon the judgments stating that\n     the communication exchanged through emails do not constitute\n     the valid arbitration agreement. Learned Senior counsel for the\n     defendants has argued that the said submission of the plaintiff\n     runs counter to the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1534152/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 7 (4)</a> of the Act and\n     the well settled position of law on the subject and as such should\n     not be readily accepted by this Court. Learned Senior counsel\n     for the defendants relied upon the judgment passed by the\n     Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/123878146/\" id=\"a_8\">Great Offshore Limited v.\n     Iranian Offshore Engineering &amp; Construction Company</a>,\n     (2008) 14 SCC 240 wherein it was observed that the intention of\n     the Act is to minimize the role of the Courts and the same can be\n     done only when the Courts will not insist upon the originals of the\n     documents, stamps, seals and even signatures in cases wherein\n     there is a clear intention to arbitrate which is emerging from the\n     intention of the parties through the negotiations between them.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">     As per the learned Senior counsel for the defendants, the\n     requirement to insist the original of the agreement as well as\n     unilaterally amending the terms of the contract does not aid the\n     case of the plaintiff at all.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                          Page 7 of 41</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\"> d)   Learned Senior counsel further stated that there is no ambiguity\n     in the arbitration clause contained in the sales confirmation in the\n     manner contended by the plaintiff. The arbitration clause as per\n     the learned Senior counsel for the defendants is clear enough to\n     include all future disputes between the parties. Therefore, the\n     said plea of the plaintiff to come out of the arbitration clause is\n     also frivolous in nature and as such liable to be rejected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"27314833\" id=\"span_9\">e)   Learned Senior counsel has argued that the challenge to the\n     arbitration to be conducted in London by the plaintiff on the\n     ground that there is no cause of action which has occurred in UK\n     is also misplaced in as much as the concept of the occurrence of\n     the cause of action with respect of the jurisdiction of the Civil\n     Court is altogether distinct from that of fixation of the seat of the\n     arbitration in foreign place. The learned Senior counsel relied\n     upon the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/27314833/\" id=\"a_9\">Gopal Singh v. Ashok Leyland Finance\n     and Anr.</a>, 164 (2009) DLT 471 in this respect.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">f)   It has been argued that the plaintiff&#x27;s plea that the arbitration\n     agreement referring the dispute to the London Metal Exchange\n     is violative of the public policy in India, is devoid of any merit in\n     as much as the rules and regulations of London Metal Exchange\n     merely      regulate   the   procedural   aspects   of   the   arbitral\n     proceedings and the proper law shall be applied whichever is\n     applicable. Further, it has been argued that the institutional\n     arbitration is a widely recognized concept in the field of the\n     arbitration and approved by the Courts. Therefore, it cannot be\n     said that the reference of the dispute to the institution located\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                            Page 8 of 41</span>\n       overseas would be against the public policy solely due to the fact\n      that there are certain variation in the appointment process and\n      procedural aspects relating to the conducting of the arbitral\n      proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">12.    In order to support this contention, learned Senior counsel for\nthe defendants has relied upon the following judgments passed by\nSupreme Court of India :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_11\">(<a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_10\">a) Bhatia International v.

By making the aforementioned submissions, learned Senior\ncounsel prayed that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the Court as to\nhow there exists no valid arbitration agreement between the parties\nand the pleas as to invalidity of the agreement are all frivolous in\nnature and ought to be rejected and this Court should thus consider\nallowing the application filed by the defendants under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 45</a> of\nthe Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">14.    Per contra, Mr.Vipin Singhania, learned counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the plaintiff has made his submissions in opposition to the\nsaid application under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 45</a> of the Act filed by the defendants\nand the same are enumerated as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">a)    Learned counsel for the plaintiff has argued that the provisions of\n      the <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8</a> of the Act are distinct from that of provisions of\n      <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 45</a> of the Act. This distinction as per the learned counsel\n      for the plaintiff is necessary as the Civil Court can while deciding\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                           Page 9 of 41</span>\n      as to whether to refer the case to the arbitration can also look\n     into the validity or otherwise of the agreement in view of the\n     express language of <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 45</a> of the Act which is impermissible\n     under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8</a> of the Act. This distinction as\n     per the learned counsel for the plaintiff makes the present case\n     different from the cases seeking the references under the\n     provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8</a> of the Act as <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 8</a> is not completely\n     analogous to <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 45</a> of the Act in every respect. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"633209\" id=\"span_14\">In order to\n     substantiate his submission, learned counsel for the plaintiff has\n     relied upon the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/633209/\" id=\"a_21\">Shin - Etsu Chemical Co. Vs.\n     Aksh Optifibre Ltd. and Anr.</a> (2005) 7 SCC 234 which lays\n     down the similar proposition.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">b)   Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the plaintiff has\n     signed the sales confirmation document under the protest that\n     the same is subject to the terms and conditions contained in the\n     purchase contract. In the said purchase contract, there existed a\n     clause wherein it has been stated that all the disputes relating to\n     the contract will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts at\n     New Delhi. As per the learned counsel for the plaintiff, the\n     defendants never objected to the existence of the said clause\n     under the purchase contract and it was also mentioned in the\n     said purchase contract that if the duly signed contract is not sent,\n     the terms and conditions of the purchase contract will be\n     deemed to be totally binding upon the buyers and the sellers. On\n     similar lines, the subsequent sale has been effected where there\n     was similar purchase order. The defendants thus have agreed to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                         Page 10 of 41</span>\n      abide by the terms and conditions of the two purchase contracts\n     including the arbitration clause. Under these circumstances, the\n     arbitration clause contained in the sales confirmation cannot be\n     pressed into service.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1360102\" id=\"span_16\">c)   Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the arbitration\n     clause in the sales offers is contrary to the purchase contract\n     wherein the jurisdiction of Delhi court has been conferred. It has\n     been argued that the offer sent by the defendants was accepted\n     by the plaintiff subject to the terms and conditions of the\n     purchase contract. Therefore, the arbitration clause contained in\n     the offer of the defendant is not applicable and is overridden by\n     the clause of the purchase contract. Learned counsel for the\n     plaintiff further argued that the arbitration clause contained in the\n     sales confirmation is null and void and incapable of being\n     performed in as much as the said agreement is not signed by the\n     plaintiff and the same is also not in writing. For all these reasons\n     stated by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, it has been argued\n     that neither there exists any valid arbitration agreement between\n     the parties nor the arbitration clause can be performed by the\n     parties and thus, the Court can infer the invalidity of the\n     arbitration agreement or incapability of the performance within\n     the meaning of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 45</a> of the Act and reject\n     the reference.

Unlike <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8</a> which\n              provides that the application shall be moved not\n              later than when submitting the first statement of the\n              substance of the dispute under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 45</a> there is\n              no such limitation. All that <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 45</a> says is that\n              when a judicial authority is seized of an action in a\n              matter in respect of which parties had made an\n              agreement for arbitration the judicial authority at the\n              request of one of the parties or any person claiming\n              through them or under him refer the parties to\n              arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is\n              null android, inoperative or incapable of being\n              performed. Prima facie, therefore, there seems to be\n              no time limit within which such an application can be\n              made. A further aspect of the matter is that even if\n              <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 45</a> is invoked, the Civil Court would continue\n              to nave jurisdiction until it decides whether the\n              arbitration agreement is void, inoperative or\n              unlawful.

To illustratively demonstrate it, we may\n     give an example. Where party is seeking reference to\n     arbitration and party raises objections going to the\n     very root of the matter that the arbitration agreement is\n     null and void, inoperative and incapable of being\n     performed, such objections, if left open and not\n     decided finally at the threshold itself may result in not\n     only parties being compelled to pursue arbitration\n     proceedings by spending time, money and efforts but\n     even the arbitral tribunal would have to spend valuable\n     time in adjudicating the complex issues relating to the\n     dispute between the parties, that may finally prove to\n     be in vain and futile. Such adjudication by the arbitral\n     tribunal may be rendered ineffective or even a nullity in\n     the event the courts upon filing of an award and at\n     execution stage held that agreement between the\n     parties was null and void inoperative and incapable of\n     being performed.&quot;                      (Emphasis Supplied)\n     &quot;The Court may also hold that the arbitral tribunal had no\n     jurisdiction to entertain and decide the issues between the\n     parties. The issue of jurisdiction normally is a mixed\n     question of law and facts. Occasionally, it may also be a\n     question of law alone. It will be appropriate to decide\n     such questions at the beginning of the proceedings\n     itself and they should have finality. Even when the\n     arbitration law in India contained the provision like\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                            Page 27 of 41</span>\n       <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 34</a> of the 1940 Act which was somewhat\n      similar to Section 4 of the English Arbitration Act,\n      1889, this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/123878146/\" id=\"a_72\">Anderson Wright Ltd.</a>\n      (supra) took the view that while dealing with the\n      question of grant or refusal of stay as contemplated\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 34</a> of the 1940 Act, it would be\n      incumbent upon the Court to decide first of all whether\n      there is a binding agreement for arbitration between\n      the parties to the suit or not. Applying the analogy\n      thereof will fortify the view that determination of\n      fundamental issues as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/724501/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 45</a> of\n      the 1996 Act at the very first instance by the judicial forum\n      is not only appropriate but is also the legislative intent.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">      Even, the language of <a href=\"/doc/724501/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 45</a> of the 1996 Act\n      suggests that unless the Court finds that an agreement\n      is null and void, inoperative and incapable of being\n      performed, it shall refer the parties to arbitration.&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      &quot;157.

From the reading of the aforementioned observations of\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/92712826/\" id=\"a_78\">Chloro Control</a> (supra), it can be\nsafely said whenever there is a plea raised by the party resisting the\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/724501/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 45</a> of the Act relating to the invalidity of the\nor inoperativeness of the arbitration agreement, the Court is obligated\nto decide the said plea prior to making the reference and once the\nCourt finds that the agreement is valid and it is equally obligatory on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                         Page 28 of 41</span>\n the Court to stay the suit by exercise of inherent powers and pass the\nappropriate orders as to reference of the dispute to the arbitration.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">19.    Therefore, the moot question which falls for consideration is the\ntenability of the plea as to invalidity of the arbitration agreement or\ninoperativeness of the arbitration agreement as raised by the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff while resisting the application under <a href=\"/doc/724501/\" id=\"a_80\">Section\n45</a> of the Act. If the said objection as to invalidity of the agreement is\nupheld, then the Court may not make the reference of the dispute to\nthe Arbitral Tribunal and as against the same if the said objection is\nrejected, the Court should immediately refer the dispute to the\narbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">20.    The plaintiff has challenged the arbitration agreement on\nvarious aspects by raising number of pleas which are dealt with in the\nfollowing manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">a)    Learned Counsel for the plaintiff has argued that there is no\n      written agreement between the parties duly signed by them\n      containing the arbitration clause. The said plea is sought to be\n      made on the ground that the sales confirmations No.6097-08\n      dated 15th January, 2009 and No.6429-09 dated 20th January,\n      2009 are the documents which have been signed under protest\n      and the said documents also do not establish the legal\n      relationship between the parties as the plaintiff has thereafter on\n      22nd January, 2009 sent the purchase contract containing the\n      terms and conditions, also containing the jurisdiction of the Delhi\n      Court clause. I find that the perusal of the documents filed along\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                         Page 29 of 41</span>\n      with the suit and the continuous communications exchanged\n     between the parties speak otherwise. This is due to the reason\n     that the sales confirmation dated 15th January, 2009 and 20th\n     January, 2009 are signed by defendant as well by the plaintiff.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">     The sales confirmation dated 15th January, 2009 is already on\n     record, however so far as the second contract is concerned, the\n     plaintiff in its legal notice dated 8th June, 2010 addressed to the\n     defendants stated that there was a second contract entered into\n     between the plaintiff and defendants on similar lines on 20th\n     January, 2009. It is correct that the said sales confirmation is\n     signed by the plaintiff by putting a note &quot;15 Days Detention\n     period is required at final destination Accepted subject to the\n     terms and condition of our purchase contract ref No. CMML/08-\n     09/146 dated 22.01.09&quot;. However, that fact by itself does not\n     mean that the said sales confirmation are not agreements in\n     writing or do not contain terms and conditions including\n     arbitration clause and are not per se signed by the parties and\n     are not intended to create a contractual or legal relationship.\n     Thus there exists clearly an agreement in writing in the form of\n     the sales confirmation which has been duly signed by both the\n     parties although the signature done by the plaintiff is under\n     protest by putting a note on the agreement &quot;15 Days Detention\n     period is required at final destination Accepted subject to the\n     terms and condition of our purchase contract ref No. CMML/08-\n     09/146 dated 22.01.09&quot; which as per the plaintiff has some legal\n     effect of making the sales confirmation non operative. I find that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                        Page 30 of 41</span>\n      from the perusal of the sales confirmation, at least one thing is\n     clear which is that there exists an agreement in writing duly\n     signed by the parties containing terms and condition and dispute\n     resolution clause and the plea of legal effect if any of the alleged\n     protest raised by the plaintiff on the sales confirmation will be\n     seen in the next paragraph of this discussion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">b)   The second plea of the plaintiff is that as the plaintiff has signed\n     the sales confirmation dated 15th January, 2009 under the\n     protest, which as per the plaintiff is subject to the terms and\n     conditions contained in the purchase contract dated 22nd\n     January, 2009 that was sent to the defendants later on,\n     therefore, the terms and conditions of the sales confirmation\n     shall stand overridden with the terms and conditions of the\n     purchase contract. As per plaintiff, the terms of the sales\n     confirmation are overridden by the purchase contract more so\n     due to the reason that the purchase contract contained a clause\n     containing deeming fiction if the agreement is not returned by the\n     party to the plaintiff within the period of three days and the said\n     deeming provision makes the purchase agreement binding on\n     both the parties. I find that the said plea of the plaintiff deserves\n     rejection for manifold reasons which are highlighted below :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">          Firstly, it is noteworthy to mention that the purchase contract\n           dated 22nd January, 2009 was not signed by the defendants\n           in any capacity, thus it is inconceivable as to how the terms\n           and conditions of the concluded contract in the form of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                          Page 31 of 41</span>\n            sales confirmation can be replaced by way of the\n           subsequent agreement which is not even signed by both the\n           parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">          Secondly, even it is assumed that there was any such\n           counter offer made by the plaintiff to the defendants by\n           sending the purchase contract, the said counter offer has to\n           be specific about the alteration of the terms and conditions\n           required to be effected within the terms of the sales\n           confirmation itself. The supply of another agreement in lieu\n           of one can never be construed as counter offer for the\n           purposes of the earlier agreement. The offer to sign a fresh\n           agreement is always an offer and not the counter offer\n           seeking to amend the terms of the previous contract unless\n           it is made clear to the other party. Further, the counter offer\n           cannot be ambiguous in nature which leaves a room of\n           doubt with respect to performance of the obligations in the\n           future. I have discerned this position by reading of the\n           documents alongside the happening of the events. On 15th\n           January, 2009, the defendants sent the sales confirmation\n           to the plaintiff for signatures. The plaintiff did not sign the\n           said sales confirmation and instead sent the purchase\n           contract on 22nd January, 2009 containing certain terms and\n           conditions upon the defendants. Later on 27th January,\n           2009, the same very plaintiff signs the sales confirmation by\n           writing a note alongside the signatures which reads &quot;15\n           Days free Detention period is required at final destination\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                          Page 32 of 41</span>\n            Accepted subject to the terms and condition of our purchase\n           contract ref No.CMML/08-09/146 dated 22.01.09&quot;. All this\n           would mean that the plaintiff was not insistent upon his\n           counter offer to alter the terms of the sales confirmation and\n           even if he was so, then the said counter offer was limited to\n           15 days time period for retention which was required by the\n           plaintiff for detention purposes at the final destination and\n           not beyond the same which the plaintiff had stated in\n           specific words at the time of signing of the sales\n           confirmation which was the event post the service of the\n           purchase contract by the plaintiff to the defendants. This is\n           due to the reason that at the time of the signing of the sales\n           confirmation on 27th January, 2009 and writing the alleged\n           protest note, the plaintiff was specific about the term namely\n           &quot;15 days free time period was required at the final\n           destination&quot; which can also be found in the purchase\n           contract as one of the term, thus the plaintiff himself limited\n           his counter offer only for 15 days time period required at the\n           final destination for detention by being specific only to the\n           said       condition   contained   in   the   note   and    thereby\n           conditionally signing the sales confirmation if at all it is to be\n           inferred that the same is conditional acceptance.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">                  Had the plaintiff really intended to alter the clause\n           relating to dispute resolution contained in the sales\n           confirmation, the plaintiff could not have readily signed the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                              Page 33 of 41</span>\n            sales confirmation/agreement but should have insisted the\n           defendants to sign the purchase contract instead of the\n           sales confirmation or otherwise could have been specific\n           about the alterations which the plaintiff intended to insist in\n           the        sales   confirmation     prior   to   signing    the     sales\n           confirmation. The note of the plaintiff does not contain any\n           specificity about the alteration of the dispute resolution\n           clause        contained   in      the   sales    confirmation      which\n           unequivocally shows his intention to alter the said clause. In\n           the absence of the same, it can be assumed or inferred that\n           all the terms of the purchase contract axiomatically stand\n           incorporated in the sales confirmation to the extent they are\n           repugnant to the terms of the sales confirmation. Adopting\n           this interpretation would mean rewriting the contract and\n           also reducing the sales confirmation into dead letters.\n           Therefore, the counter offer/ conditional acceptance of the\n           plaintiff at the time of the signing of the sales confirmation\n           agreement was not specific in nature to the extent of\n           replacement of the dispute resolution clause or mode of\n           resolving the dispute enabling the defendants to become\n           aware of the plaintiff&#x27;s position immediately prior to the\n           signing of the sales confirmation. There is also no letter or\n           communication on record written by the plaintiff either prior\n           to 22nd January, 2009 or thereafter to the defendants\n           pointing out that the plaintiff could not sign the sales\n           confirmation unless certain terms including the clause\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                                   Page 34 of 41</span>\n            relating to the dispute resolution are altered in the sales\n           confirmation. In such circumstances, the parties were not\n           ad idem as to the alleged counter offer of plaintiff towards\n           the alterations which the plaintiff intended to conduct in the\n           sales confirmation that could have given the defendants\n           chance to either accept or reject the counter offer of the\n           plaintiff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">          Thirdly, the plea of the plaintiff that once the purchase\n           contract was served upon the defendants, the same is\n           sufficient counter offer to the defendants may not also be\n           accepted. This is due to the reason that serving of the\n           purchase contract upon the defendants is offering the\n           defendants to sign the purchase contract instead of the\n           sales confirmation. The defendants always maintained the\n           position that they intended the plaintiff to sign the sales\n           confirmation in the form of the agreement, which was\n           eventually signed by the plaintiff later on 22nd January,\n           2009. The defendants did not either accept the offer of the\n           plaintiff to sign the purchase contract nor reject the same\n           but always insisted upon signing of the sales confirmation.\n           The plaintiff in order to counter this position also stated that\n           there is a deeming clause contained in the purchase\n           contract making it binding upon both the parties to accept\n           the terms of the purchase contract. I find that said position is\n           unreasonable and cannot be accepted. This is due to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                           Page 35 of 41</span>\n            reason that if the deeming fiction could have come into play\n           on 19th January, 2009 or three days thereafter or even later\n           on when the defendants did not provide the duly signed\n           version of the purchase contract to the plaintiff. The plaintiff\n           could have written to the defendants that the purchase\n           contract has now become binding upon us and there is no\n           need to sign the sales confirmation as a separate\n           agreement. The plaintiff on the contrary fails to take any\n           action of this nature but proceeds to sign the sales\n           confirmation on 27th January, 2009 which was already given\n           signed to him from the defendants&#x27; end by putting a limited\n           protest relating to 15 days period required for detention\n           purposes at the final destination without mentioning the\n           alteration of the dispute resolution clause so that the chance\n           may be given to the defendants to consider such offer of\n           alteration. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to\n           assume that any such deeming provision has come into play\n           which makes the purchase contract binding upon the\n           plaintiff and defendants when the plaintiff itself is signing the\n           sales confirmation later on 22nd January, 2009 without\n           informing the defendants anything about the operation of the\n           deeming clause. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140286\" id=\"span_60\">The said argument of the plaintiff is thus\n           without any substance and is liable to be rejected.\n          Fourthly, it is well established principle of law that the\n           arbitration clause is distinct agreement from that of the\n           underlying contract.

(See <a href=\"/doc/140286/\" id=\"a_81\">National\n           Agricultural Co-op.

Maharashtra       Krishna      Valley\n           Development Corporation and Ors., (2009) 2 SCC 494).\n           Therefore, even if the parties intended to change the\n           performance of the obligations under the contract like 15\n           days free time period required for detention at the final\n           destination and accepted subject to terms of the purchase\n           contract, still, it was all the more necessary for the plaintiff to\n           point out about the alteration of dispute resolution\n           mechanism to the defendants as the said term is collateral\n           term in the agreement and does not get perished on\n           account of change in the performances or other alterations\n           in the agreement. The plaintiff did not point out the said fact\n           to the defendants immediately prior to the signing of the\n           sales confirmation on 27th January, 2009 nor there is any\n           communication giving any hint towards the same. Therefore,\n           the dispute resolution clause cannot be said to be altered\n           automatically and impliedly till the time it is specifically the\n           same is abrogated with the consent of the parties.\n           Therefore, the plaintiff cannot wriggle out of the arbitration\n           clause in the manner sought to be done by him.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                             Page 37 of 41</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">           Fifthly, it is also noteworthy to mention that both the plaintiff\n           and defendants after signing the sales confirmation carried\n           forward with the working of the contract by referring to the\n           sales confirmation No.6097-08 which can be seen from the\n           communications and emails which have been exchanged\n           between the plaintiff, third parties and the defendants in the\n           month of February and March, 2009. All this means that the\n           intention of the parties was to further the intention of the\n           parties contained in the sales confirmation and not to alter\n           the same after signing the agreement in the month of\n           January, 2009. Therefore, the intention of the parties was\n           always to proceed with the working of the sales confirmation\n           and not to obstruct the same. Thus, in such a case, it cannot\n           be said that the arbitration agreement should be replaced\n           with clause contained in the purchase contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">                 For all these reasons, I reject the plea of the plaintiff\n           that the terms of the purchase contract are to be read into\n           the sales confirmation or the sales confirmation was\n           subrogated with the purchase contract by operation of the\n           deeming provision contained in the purchase contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">c)   The plaintiff has also challenged the arbitration clause contained\n     in clause &#x27;J&#x27; as being ambiguous in nature and not qualifying the\n     ingredients of the valid arbitration clause. This plea has been\n     taken by the plaintiff by urging that the arbitration clause\n     nowhere points out the manner of conducting the arbitration and\n     also the number of the arbitration, binding decision attached to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                            Page 38 of 41</span>\n      the arbitration etc. I find the said plea as meritless. This is due to\n     the reason that clause &#x27;J&#x27; of the sales confirmation starts with the\n     head note arbitration and then it says that all the disputes\n     differences which may arise out of this contract are to be\n     submitted to the Rules and Regulations of the London Metal\n     Exchange in London. The rules and regulations of London Metal\n     Exchange further contain the details, the manner of the\n     appointment of the arbitrator and further procedural aspects\n     contained therein. Even the plaintiff itself argued alternatively\n     that the arbitration in London Metal Exchange is not workable as\n     the rules of London Metal Exchange provides for appointment of\n     two arbitrators which are against the public policy. Once, the\n     plaintiff himself points out that the rules of London Metal\n     Exchange contains the mechanism for appointment of the\n     arbitrator and the manner of conducting of the proceedings, I do\n     not find that the arbitration clause is ambiguous or is not\n     workable on any count merely if the clause provides minimum\n     details of working of the Arbitral Tribunal till the time it\n     incorporates the rules and regulation of the London Metal\n     Exchange in its wordings and subject the parties to the said rules\n     and regulations containing the said procedural rules and the\n     manner of conducting the proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28713830\" id=\"span_64\">d)   The plaintiff has also challenged the rules and regulation of\n     London Metal Exchange as being contrary to public policy by\n     pointing out variations in the methods of the working of the\n     arbitrators. Further, it has been argued that there was no cause\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">CS(OS) No.2349/2010                                           Page 39 of 41</span>\n       of action in London therefore, the arbitration in London is also\n      against the public policy as the London would not be forum\n      vested with the jurisdiction. I reject this contention of the learned\n      counsel for the plaintiff as well. This is due to the reason that the\n      parties are free to choose the place or seat of the arbitration at\n      any place and subject to the rules and regulations of any\n      institution situated therein at least in the cases involving\n      International Commercial Arbitration. Such choice of the forum\n      for conducting the International Commercial Arbitration is\n      provided even under the Act. Thus, there are no public policy\n      issues by merely choosing the forum for the purposes of the seat\n      of the arbitration. Likewise, the curial law for the purposes of the\n      conducting the International Commercial Arbitration proceedings\n      in the foreign court is also within the free choice of the parties\n      and thus the mere fact that the appointments and challenge to\n      the award shall be subject to the different system of law or the\n      said provides different number of the arbitrators or different set\n      of procedure are no grounds which allows this Court to interdict\n      in the cases involving the International Commercial Arbitrations.\n      The recent decision of <a href=\"/doc/28713830/\" id=\"a_82\">Reliance Industries Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. U.O.I</a>,\n      (2014) 7 SCC 603 expounds the same view. Accordingly, the\n      submission of the learned counsel for the plaintiff is rejected.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92712826\" id=\"span_66\">21.

In view of my discussion done in the preceding\nparagraphs, I find that none of the grounds raised by the plaintiff to\ndispute the validity of the arbitration agreement is tenable which can\nbe said to vitiate the arbitration agreement entered into between the\nparties contained in the sales confirmation. Accordingly, following the\ndictum in <a href=\"/doc/92712826/\" id=\"a_83\">Chloro Control</a> (supra), I find that no ground exists for this\nCourt to hold that the agreement containing the arbitration clause is\ninvalid, inoperative or incapable of being performed and consequently\nthe present suit is not maintainable and disposed of accordingly.
