Whatever services of GTA\n      were availed by them was in respect of\n      Construction service and the exemption\n      on value which is in excess of 33% was\n      availed by them continuously.

The\n      construction activity was not initiated\n      and completed in March&#x27;2006, therefore\n      the GTA services before March&#x27;06 has\n      clear linkage for the service tax paid\n      on construction service in March &#x27;06.

At this stage, it is important to\n        note the scheme of taxation under our\n        Constitution. In the lists contained in\n        the 7th Schedule to the Constitution,\n        taxation entries are to be found only in\n        lists I and II. This is for the reason\n        that   in   our   Constitutional   scheme,\n        taxation powers of the Centre and the\n        States are mutually exclusive. There is no\n        concurrent power of taxation. This being\n        the case, the moment the levy contained in\n        a taxing statute transgresses into a\n        prohibited exclusive field, it is liable\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                 Page 22 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                          Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n  to be struck down. In the present case,\n  the   dichotomy   is   between   sales   tax\n  leviable by the States and service tax\n  leviable by the Centre. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"716582\" id=\"span_51\">When it comes to\n  composite   indivisible   works   contracts,\n  such contracts can be taxed by Parliament\n  as well as State legislatures. Parliament\n  can only tax the service element contained\n  in these contracts, and the States can\n  only tax the transfer of property in goods\n  element contained in these contracts.\n  Thus,   it   becomes   very   important   to\n  segregate the two elements completely for\n  if some element of transfer of property in\n  goods remains when a service tax is\n  levied, the said levy would be found to be\n  constitutionally infirm. This position is\n  well reflected in <a href=\"/doc/716582/\" id=\"a_17\">Bharat Sanchar Nigam\n  Limited v. Union of India</a>, (2006) 3 SCC 1,\n  as follows:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1483017\" id=\"span_52\">&quot;No one denies the legislative competence\n  of the States to levy sales tax on sales\n  provided that the necessary concomitants\n  of a sale are present in the transaction\n  and the sale is distinctly discernible in\n  the transaction. This does not however\n  allow the State to entrench upon the Union\n  List and tax services by including the\n  cost of such service in the value of the\n  goods. Even in those composite contracts\n  which are by legal fiction deemed to be\n  divisible   under <a href=\"/doc/92143428/\" id=\"a_18\">Article   366(29-A)</a>, the\n  value of the goods involved in the\n  execution of the whole transaction cannot\n  be assessed to sales tax.

Although generally\n  speaking, a liberal interpretation must be\n  given to taxing entries, this would not\n  bring within its purview a tax on subject-\n  matter which a fair reading of the entry\n  does not cover. If in substance, the\n  statute is not referable to a field given\n  to the State, the court will not by any\n  principle   of   interpretation   allow   a\n  statute not covered by it to intrude upon\n  this field.&quot; (at paras 88 and 89)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">  17. We find that the assessees are correct\n  in their submission that a works contract\n  is a separate species of contract distinct\n  from contracts for services simpliciter\n  recognized by the world of commerce and\n  law   as  such,    and   has   to   be   taxed\n  separately as such.

The\n  several   forms   which   such   kinds   of\n  contracts can assume are set out in Hudson\n  on Building Contracts, at p. 165. It is\n  possible that the parties might enter into\n  distinct and separate contracts, one for\n  the   transfer  of   materials  for   money\n  consideration, and the other for payment\n  of remuneration for services and for work\n  done. In such a case, there are really two\n  agreements, though there is a single\n  instrument embodying them, and the power\n  of the State to separate the agreement to\n  sell, from the agreement to do work and\n  render service and to impose a tax thereon\n  cannot be questioned, and will stand\n  untouched by the present judgment.&quot; (at\n  page 427)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"85571316\" id=\"span_58\">18.

This Court in Mathuram Agrawal                       v.\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">  State of M.P., (1999) 8 SCC 667, held:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">  &quot;Another    question     that     arises   for\n  consideration    in    this    connection   is\n  whether sub-section (1) of Section 127-A\n  and the proviso to sub-section (2)(b)\n  should be construed together and the\n  annual letting values of all the buildings\n  owned by a person to be taken together for\n  determining the amount to be paid as tax\n  in respect of each building. In our\n  considered view this position cannot be\n  accepted. The intention of the legislature\n  in a taxation statute is to be gathered\n  from   the   language    of   the   provisions\n  particularly where the language is plain\n  and unambiguous. In a taxing Act it is not\n  possible   to   assume    any   intention   or\n  governing purpose of the statute more than\n  what is stated in the plain language. It\n  is not the economic results sought to be\n  obtained by making the provision which is\n  relevant in interpreting a fiscal statute.\n  Equally impermissible is an interpretation\n  which does not follow from the plain,\n  unambiguous language of the statute. Words\n  cannot be added to or substituted so as to\n  give a meaning to the statute which will\n  serve the spirit and intention of the\n  legislature. The statute should clearly\n  and   unambiguously     convey     the   three\n  components of the tax law i.e. the subject\n  of the tax, the person who is liable to\n  pay the tax and the rate at which the tax\n  is to be paid. If there is any ambiguity\n  regarding any of these ingredients in a\n  taxation statute then there is no tax in\n  law. Then it is for the legislature to do\n  the needful in the matter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">   This construction, in our considered\n  view,    amounts    to    supplementing    the\n  charging section by including something\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                   Page 28 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                   Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n  which the provision does not state. The\n  construction placed on the said provision\n  does not flow from the plain language of\n  the provision. The proviso requires the\n  exempted property to be subjected to tax\n  and for the purpose of valuing that\n  property alone the value of the other\n  properties    is   to    be   taken   into\n  consideration. But, if in doing so, the\n  said property becomes taxable, the Act\n  does not provide at what rate it would be\n  taxable. One cannot determine the rateable\n  value of the small property by aggregating\n  and adding the value of other properties,\n  and arrive at a figure which is more than\n  possibly the value of the property itself.\n  Moreover, what rate of tax is to be\n  applied to such a property is also not\n  indicated.&quot; (at paras 12 and 16)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">  22.

The first\n  is the character of the imposition known\n  by its nature which prescribes the taxable\n  event attracting the levy, the second is a\n  clear indication of the person on whom the\n  levy is imposed and who is obliged to pay\n  the tax, the third is the rate at which\n  the tax is imposed, and the fourth is the\n  measure or value to which the rate will be\n  applied for computing the tax liability.\n  If those components are not clearly and\n  definitely ascertainable, it is difficult\n  to say that the levy exists in point of\n  law. Any uncertainty or vagueness in the\n  legislative scheme defining any of those\n  components of the levy will be fatal to\n  its validity.&quot; (at para 6)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                   Page 29 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                   Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1411881\" id=\"span_70\">23. To similar effect is this Court&#x27;s\n  judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1411881/\" id=\"a_30\">CIT v. B.C.

The asset must be one\n  which falls within the contemplation of\n  the section. It must bear that quality\n  which brings <a href=\"/doc/152475884/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 45</a> into play. To\n  determine whether the goodwill of a new\n  business   is    such  an   asset,   it   is\n  permissible, as we shall presently show,\n  to refer to certain other sections of the\n  head, &quot;Capital gains&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/152475884/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 45</a> is a\n  charging section. For the purpose of\n  imposing   the    charge.   Parliament   has\n  enacted detailed provisions in order to\n  compute the profits or gains under that\n  head. No existing principle or provision\n  at variance with them can be applied for\n  determining the chargeable profits and\n  gains. All transactions encompassed by\n  <a href=\"/doc/152475884/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 45</a> must fall under the governance\n  of    its    computation    provisions.    A\n  transaction to which those provisions\n  cannot be applied must be regarded as\n  never intended by <a href=\"/doc/152475884/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 45</a> to be the\n  subject of the charge. This inference\n  flows from the general arrangement of the\n  provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_36\">Income Tax Act</a>, where\n  under each head of income the charging\n  provision is accompanied by a set of\n  provisions    for   computing   the   income\n  subject to that charge. The character of\n  the computation provisions in each case\n  bears a relationship to the nature of the\n  charge. Thus the charging section and the\n  computation provisions together constitute\n  an integrated code. When there is a case\n  to which the computation provisions cannot\n  apply at all, it is evident that such a\n  case was not intended to fall within the\n  charging section. Otherwise one would be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                   Page 30 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                   Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n  driven to conclude that while a certain\n  income seems to fall within the charging\n  section there is no scheme of computation\n  for   quantifying     it.   The    legislative\n  pattern discernible in the Act is against\n  such a conclusion. It must be borne in\n  mind   that   the   legislative    intent   is\n  presumed to run uniformly through the\n  entire conspectus of provisions pertaining\n  to each head of income. No doubt there is\n  a   qualitative    difference    between   the\n  charging    provision   and   a    computation\n  provision. And ordinarily the operation of\n  the charging provision cannot be affected\n  by   the   construction   of    a   particular\n  computation provision. But the question\n  here is whether it is possible to apply\n  the computation provision at all if a\n  certain interpretation is pressed on the\n  charging provision. That pertains to the\n  fundamental integrality of the statutory\n  scheme provided for each head.&quot; (at para\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">  10)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">  24. A close look at the <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_37\">Finance Act, 1994</a>\n  would show that the five taxable services\n  referred   to   in    the    charging <a href=\"/doc/186455273/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n  65(105)</a> would   refer     only   to   service\n  contracts simpliciter and not to composite\n  works contracts. This is clear from the\n  very   language   of <a href=\"/doc/186455273/\" id=\"a_39\">Section    65(105)</a> which\n  defines &quot;taxable service&quot; as &quot;any service\n  provided&quot;. All the services referred to in\n  the said sub-clauses are service contracts\n  simpliciter without any other element in\n  them, such as for example, a service\n  contract which is a commissioning and\n  installation, or erection, commissioning\n  and    installation    contract.     Further,\n  under <a href=\"/doc/61667332/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 67</a>, as has been pointed out\n  above, the value of a taxable service is\n  the gross amount charged by the service\n  provider for such service rendered by him.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                   Page 31 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                   Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\"> C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n  This would unmistakably show that what is\n  referred to in the charging provision is\n  the   taxation    of     service    contracts\n  simpliciter   and    not    composite   works\n  contracts, such as are contained on the\n  facts of the present cases. It will also\n  be noticed that no attempt to remove the\n  non-service elements from the composite\n  works contracts has been made by any of\n  the aforesaid Sections by deducting from\n  the gross value of the works contract the\n  value of property in goods transferred in\n  the execution of a works contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">  25.

This is\n  done by adopting the value that is adopted\n  for the purpose of payment of VAT. The\n  rule goes on to say that the service\n  component of the works contract is to\n  include the eight elements laid down in\n  the second Gannon Dunkerley case including\n  apportionment     of    the     cost    of\n  establishment, other expenses and profit\n  earned by the service provider as is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                   Page 32 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                   Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n  relatable only to supply of labour and\n  services.

These infrastructure projects have\n     been excluded and continue to be excluded\n     presumably because they are conceived in\n     the national interest. If learned counsel\n     for the revenue were right, each of these\n     excluded works contracts could be taxed\n     under    the    five    sub-heads    of <a href=\"/doc/186455273/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n     65(105)</a> contained      in    the <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_44\">Finance   Act,\n     1994</a>.

Yet, if\n     learned counsel for the revenue is right,\n     such contracts, not being exempt under\n     the <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_46\">Finance Act, 1994</a>, would fall within\n     its   tentacles,     which    was   never   the\n     intention of Parliament.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">4.11.

We have heard both the sides and\n  perused the appeal records. Admittedly,\n  the contracts executed by the appellants\n  are composite in nature and are rightly to\n  be classified under tax entry &quot;works\n  contract service&quot;. As held by Hon&#x27;ble\n  Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/155272316/\" id=\"a_52\">Larsen &amp; Toubro Limited</a>\n  (supra) there is no liability to service\n  tax in respect of indivisible, composite\n  works contract prior to 1.6.2007. The\n  appellants   are    not    contesting   their\n  service tax liability under works contract\n  service after 1.6.2007. The dispute is\n  only relating to their entitlement to pay\n  the said tax in terms of the composition\n  scheme of 2007. The Original Authority\n  held that the appellants switched over\n  from &#x27;construction service&#x27; to &#x27;works\n  contract service&#x27; without intimating the\n  service    tax     department     and    thus\n  contravened the provisions of the said\n  scheme.   We   note   that   the   activities\n  carried out by the appellants are taxable\n  only w.e.f. 1.6.2007. In such situation,\n  it is clear that their payment of tax in\n  terms of composition scheme should be\n  examined for correctness based on the said\n  provisions only. It is seen that there is\n  no format or prescribed specific procedure\n  for exercising separate option under the\n  scheme. After the introduction of new tax\n  entry   when   the   appellants    discharged\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                             Page 38 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                      Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n C/SCA/11513/2019                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n  service tax in terms of the applicable\n  provisions, it is clear their entitlement\n  cannot be denied. We note that in terms of\n  calculation in Annexure B to the show\n  cause notice, the differential service tax\n  is only relatable to denial of the said\n  composition scheme to the appellant. We\n  find that the denial of composition scheme\n  by the Original Authority is mainly on the\n  ground that the appellant cannot exercise\n  option under the scheme as the contracts\n  were    taxable     under   &#x27;commercial     or\n  industrial        construction       service&#x27;/\n  &#x27;construction of complex service&#x27; prior to\n  1.6.2007 and accordingly after 1.6.2007\n  they cannot opt for payment of service tax\n  under    works    contract    service    under\n  composition scheme.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155272316\" id=\"span_92\">We find that in view\n  of the legal position settled by the\n  Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/155272316/\" id=\"a_53\">Larsen &amp; Toubro\n  Limited</a> (supra) the appellant is not\n  liable to any service tax in respect of\n  these     indivisible,     composite     works\n  contract prior to 1.6.2007, As such,\n  subject to fulfillment of the conditions,\n  the appellants are eligible to discharge\n  service tax on such works contract, after\n  1.6.2007, in terms of composition scheme\n  of 2007. The reason for denial of the\n  benefit recorded in the impugned order is\n  not sustainable. We find, considering the\n  facts and circumstances of the case, the\n  imposition of penalties on the appellant\n  is not justified. The tax liability of the\n  composite    works   contract   has   been   a\n  subject    matter    of   large    number   of\n  litigations and the final legal position\n  was clarified only after the decision of\n  the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, as above. In such\n  situation, no penalty can be imposed on\n  the appellant, especially when they have\n  discharged service tax in terms of the\n  provisions,    as   applicable    during   the\n  relevant time and as per the understanding\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                   Page 39 of 55</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                   Downloaded on : Mon Feb 15 13:20:58 IST 2021</span>\n    C/SCA/11513/2019                                                JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n     of such provision during the relevant\n     time.

The Apex Court\n    therefore was of the opinion that the service\n    tax     charging           Section         itself        must         lay       down\n    with specificity that the levy of the service\n    tax can only be on works contracts, and the\n    measure of tax only be on that portion of\n    works        contracts            which          contain          a      service\n    element which is to be derived from the gross\n    amount charged for the works contract less\n    the       value           of      the           property           in         goods\n    transferred           in       the     execution            of      the       works\n    contract.            In    such       circumstances,                  the       Apex\n    Court       held      that        when          the    legislature                has\n    introduced            the      concept           of    service            tax       on\n    indivisible               works          contracts               then           such\n    contracts were never intended to the subject\n    matter        of     the       service          tax,    and        therefore,\n    such contracts, not being exempt under the\n    <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_71\">Finance Act, 1994</a>, cannot be said to fall\n    within its tentacles, as which was never the\n    intention            of     Parliament.
