In the matter of a contract there may arise causes of action of \n     various kinds. In a suit for damages for breach of contract the cause \n     of action consists of the making of the contract, and of its breach, so \n     that the suit may be filed either at the place where the contract was \n\n\n\n\n                                                \n     made or at the place where it should have been performed and the \n     breach occurred. The making of the contract is part of the cause of \n     action. A suit on a contract, therefore, can be filed at the place where \n                           \n     it was made. The determination of the place where the contract was \n     made is part of the law of contract. But making of an offer on a \n     particular place does not form cause of action in a suit for damages \n                          \n     for   breach   of   contract.   Ordinarily,   acceptance   of  an   offer   and   its \n     intimation result in a contract and hence a suit can be filed in a court \n     within whose jurisdiction  the acceptance  was  communicated.  The \n     performance of a contract is part of cause of action and a suit in \n     respect   of the  breach   can  always   be filed   at  the  place   where  the \n      \n\n\n     contract should have performed or its performance completed. If the \n     contract is to be performed at the place where it is made, the suit on \n   \n\n\n\n     the contract is to be filed there and nowhere else In suits for agency \n     actions the cause of action arises at the place where the contract of \n     agency was made or the place where actions are to be rendered and \n     payment is to be made by the agent. Part of cause of action arises \n\n\n\n\n\n     where money is expressly or impliedly payable under a contract. In \n     cases of repudiation  of a contract,  the place where repudiation  is \n     received is the place where the suit would lie. If a contract is pleaded \n     as part of the cause of action giving jurisdiction to the Court where \n     the suit is filed and that contract is found to be invalid, such part of \n\n\n\n\n\n     cause of the action disappears. The above are some of the connecting \n     factors.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     16. So long as the parties to a contract do not oust the jurisdiction of \n     all the Courts which would otherwise have jurisdiction to decide the \n     cause of action under the law it cannot be said that the parties have \n     by their contract ousted the jurisdiction of the Court.

But objection based on jurisdiction \n     is a matter which parties could waive and it is in this sense if such \n     jurisdiction is exercised by Courts it does not go to the core of it so \n     as to make the resultant judgment a nullity. Thus it is now a settled \n     principle that where there may be two or more competent Courts \n\n\n\n\n                                                \n     which   can   entertain   a   suit   consequent   upon   a   part   of   the   causes \n     action having arisen there within, if the parties to the contract agree \n                           \n     to vest jurisdiction in one such court to try the dispute which might \n     arise as between themselves the agreement would be valid.

When   the   Court   has   to   decide   the   question   of \n     jurisdiction pursuant to an ouster clause it is necessary to \n   \n\n\n\n     construe the ousting expression or clause properly. Often \n     the   stipulation   is   that   the   contract   shall   be   deemed   to \n     have been made at a particular place. This would provide \n     the connecting factor for jurisdiction to the Courts of that \n\n\n\n\n\n     place in the matter of any dispute on or arising out of that \n     contract.   It   would   not,   however,   ipso   facto   take   away \n     jurisdiction   of   other   Courts.   Thus,   in   <a href=\"/doc/1647074/\" id=\"a_21\">Salem   Chemical \n     Industries   v.

From the foregoing decisions it can be reasonably deduced that \n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n     where such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether \n     there is ouster of jurisdiction of other Courts. When the clause is \n     clear, unambiguous and specific accepted notions of contract would \n     bind the parties and unless the absence of ad idem can be shown, the \n\n\n\n\n                                                                   \n     other   Courts   should   avoid   exercising   jurisdiction,   As   regards \n     construction   of   the   ouster   clause   when   words   like   &#x27;alone&#x27;,   &#x27;only, \n     &#x27;exclusive&#x27; and the like have been used there may be no difficulty. \n     Even without such words in appropriate cases the maxim &#x27;expressio \n     unius  est exclusio  alterius&#x27;  -expression of one is  the  exclusion  of \n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n     another may be applied. What is an appropriate case shall depend on \n     the facts of the case. In such a case mention of one thing may imply \n                            \n     exclusion   of   another.   When   certain   jurisdiction   is   specified   in   a \n     contract an intention to exclude all others from its operation may in \n     such cases be inferred. It has therefore to be properly construed.\n</p>                           \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">     22.   Coming   to   Clause   11   we   already   found   that   this   clause   was \n     included in the general terms and conditions of sale and the order of \n     confirmation No. 68/59 dated 2.10.1974 with the general terms and \n     conditions was sent from Udyognagar, Mohmadabad, Gujarat to the \n     respondent&#x27;s address at 12 Suramangalam Road Salem, Tamilnadu. \n</p>      \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">     The statement made in the Special Leave Petition that Udyognagar, \n     Mohamadabad, Gujarat is within the jurisdiction of the civil Court of \n   \n\n\n\n     Kaira has not. been controverted. We have already seen that making \n     of the contract  was a part of the cause of action and a suit on a \n     contract therefore could be filed at the place where it was made. \n     Thus Kaira court would even otherwise have had jurisdiction. The \n\n\n\n\n\n     bobbins   of   metallic   yarn   were   delivered   at   the   address   of   the \n     respondent at Salem which, therefore, would provide the connecting \n     factor   for   Court   at   Salem   to   have   jurisdiction.   If   out   of   the   two \n     jurisdictions one was excluded by Clause 11 it would not absolutely \n     oust the jurisdiction of the Court and, therefore, would not he void \n     against public policy and would not violate <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_24\">28</a> of the \n\n\n\n\n\n     Contract Act.

In the clause &#x27;any \n     dispute arising out of this sale shall be subject to Kaira jurisdiction&#x27; \n     ex facie we do not find exclusive words like &#x27;exclusive&#x27;, &#x27;alone, &#x27;only&#x27; \n     and the like. Can the maxim &#x27;expressio unius est exclusio alterius&#x27; be \n     applied under the facts and circumstances of the case ? The order of \n     confirmation   is   of   no   assistance.

In the latter \n     case   the   suit   was   based   wholly   on   tort   and   tort   alone   and   the   action \n                             \n     complained of was totally unconnected with the Contract; the High Court \n     actually recorded a finding that the cause of action in the suit had no \n     connection direct or indirect with the Contract itself and the reference to \n                            \n     the Contract was only a link in the story to show how the goods came to \n     be in the possession of the defendants and the claim was not based in any \n     way on or related to the contract itself. In the final analysis the question \n     as to whether a claim based on tort is a claim de hors the contract which \n      \n\n     contains   the   arbitration   clause   or   is   directly   or   inextricably   connected \n     with the contract  has to be decided on the facts  of each case and the \n     language used in the arbitration clause.&quot;\n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1996483\" id=\"span_25\">(i)             Learned counsel for the  defendant placed reliance \n     on the judgment   of this court in   case of <a href=\"/doc/1996483/\" id=\"a_30\">Pacific Refractories \n\n\n\n\n\n     Ltd.

An important question to be determined in such cases, would be the \n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n     reason for the inclusion of such a clause. The Calcutta High Court and \n     Courts situated within the territorial limit of the Calcutta High Court \n     (for brevity referred to as the Calcutta High Court), in any event, had \n     jurisdiction.   Thus,   in   the   present   case,   <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_37\">Article   39</a>   was   not   for   the \n     purpose of conferring jurisdiction on the Calcutta High Court because \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n     the parties were of the view that otherwise the Calcutta High Court \n     would   have   no   jurisdiction.   Parties   cannot   by   consent   confer \n                              \n     jurisdiction upon a place or a Court which has none. I am not, however, \n     on the question of law. I am considering what the parties had in mind \n     when they entered into the contract. The Calcutta High Court, in any \n                             \n     event, had jurisdiction and the parties knew, and, in any event, must be \n     deemed to have known the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">     38. Further, atleast three places would have jurisdiction in respect of \n     disputes arising under the contract. The Calcutta  High Court, as we \n     have seen, has jurisdiction. If a claim was to be brought against the \n      \n\n\n     plaintiff by the defendant, the Courts in Bombay, would certainly have \n     jurisdiction for the defendant carries on business in Bombay. Thirdly, \n   \n\n\n\n     the   place   where   the   contract   was   to   be   performed   would   have \n     jurisdiction. The goods were supplied by the defendant from Rajasthan \n     to the defendants in Bellary, Karnataka.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">     39.   Added   to   this   is   the   fact   that   Mr.   Kutty   did   not   offer   any \n     explanation for the inclusion of <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 39.</a> The inclusion of a term in a \n     contract   must   signify   something   unless   it   is   shown   to   have   been \n     included by mistake. It is not the plaintiff&#x27;s case that the parties were \n     not ad-idem or that the clause was included in the contract by mistake. \n     It is not the plaintiff&#x27;s case that they were unaware of <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 39</a> in the \n\n\n\n\n\n     contract. It is not the plaintiff&#x27;s case that the clause was inserted for a \n     purpose other than for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction. It is not \n     even   the   plaintiff&#x27;s   case   that   the   parties   were   of   the   view   that   the \n     Calcutta High Court would otherwise have no jurisdiction and that the \n     clause was therefore included.

(36) 1949 Ca. 179).  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">            What the Court is to look into is what the substance of the plaint is but not  \n            how the claim is framed.  If the cause of action on which the claim is based is  \n            an independent one which does not arise on the contract or is in relation to  \n            the contract, it is idle to suggest that merely because at some earlier stage  \n\n\n\n\n\n            there was a contract and, not giving the history of the case, some reference  \n            has to be made to a previous contract, it cannot be said in every such case  \n            that it is in some way or other related to the contract.  Reliance however was  \n            placed by thelearned advocate on behalf of the opposite party on Woolf v.  \n            Collis Removal Services, (1948) 1 K. B. 11.  As observed by Lord Asquith, the  \n            breach in this particular case on which the cause of action was based was  \n            principally one of neglect in the performance of the contract itself.  Under the  \n            contract,   a   party   was   bound   to   take   due   care   of   the   different   items   of  \n            furniture and if such articles had been removed to an undesirable place and  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 27/08/2013 21:19:21 :::</span>\n                                                  .. 27 ..                            chs-163.09.jsxw\n\n\n             no proper care had been taken during the period the goods were so stored  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  \n             there, it is the failure of the party to take due care of those articles which they  \n             were  bound  to do  under  the  contract.    In this view  of  the reading  of the  \n             contract, the Court of appeal came to the conclusion that even though the suit  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n             was technically framed in tort, there is a sufficiently close connection between  \n             the claim as made and the transaction as under the contract to bring the  \n             claim   within   the   arbitration   clause.     It   was   further   observed   that   claims  \n             which   were   entirely   unrelated   to   the   transaction   covered   by   the   contract  \n             would no doubt be excluded.  The claim in that case was held to be one which  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n             came within the arbitration clause as having arisen though not directly but  \n             at least indirectly under the contract.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">             (7)           Whether in a case the dispute arisen out of the contract or its in  \n             relation to the contract or not must depend on the particular facts of each  \n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n             case.  The facts of the case now before us however do not make it possible to  \n             attract the special reasons given by the Court of Appeal in Woolf v.

The cause of action in this case  \n             is based wholly upon tort and tort alone which has got no connection direct  \n             or indirect with the contract itself.  As indicated already, the reference to the  \n             contract is only a link in the story to show how the goods came to be in the  \n                                \n             possession of the defendants and the claim is not based in any way or related  \n             to the contract itself.  \n</p>     \n          \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">        (c   )   Mr   Cama   learned   counsel   also   placed   reliance   on   the \n       \n\n\n\n        Judgment  of  court  of  Appeal  in  case  of  Monro  Vs.

They filed an affidvit to which the  \n         plaintiff filed another affidavit in reply.

Now,   I   do   not   think   that   that   was   a  \n         question for the master at all.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">         The question was whether this actions should be stayed.   In my opinion this  \n         is in no sense of the word an action upon the contract at all.  It is an action  \n         for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation which induced the plaintiff to  \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n         enter into the contract, and it is also an action for an injunction to prevent  \n         the defendants  from using or in any way dealing with the plaintiff&#x27;s plant  \n                            \n         and   material,   and   then,   in   the   alternative,   although   not   in   terms   so  \n         expressed,   there   is   a   claim   for   work   and   labour   done   upon   a   quantum  \n         meruit   which   he   could   not   maintain   if   his   contract   were   in   existence,  \n         because   he   could   then   only   sue   for   any   instalments   that   might   be   due  \n                           \n         according to the terms of the contract.  It is, therefore, in no sense an action  \n         on the contract at all.  Nor do I think that it is an action in relation to or in  \n         connection with the contract.  In one sense it is an action in relation to or in  \n         connection with the ocntract, because if there has never been any contract  \n         there would never have been any cause of action, there would never have  \n          \n\n\n         been any representation, and there would never have been any claim for  \n         damages.  But it is not in relation to or in connection with the contract, in  \n       \n\n\n\n         my opinion, within the meaning of the arbitration clause.  That being so, I  \n         think the action is with reference to matters wholly outside the powers of the  \n         arbitrator and with which he could not possibly deal.  It may be a very bad  \n         action; the master thinks it is.   The defendants, if they have a sufficiently  \n         strong opinion about it, and if they have sufficient materials to do so, have  \n\n\n\n\n\n         the power to apply to stay the action or to dismiss it on the ground of it  \n         being frivolous and vexatious, or on the ground that the claim discloses no  \n         cause of action, or that it is an abuse of the process of court.  They have all  \n         those steps that they can take if they think fit to do so.  But that is not the  \n         point that we have to decide.  What we have to decide is whether this is an  \n         action that ought to be brought withing the provisions of the arbitration  \n\n\n\n\n\n         within that clause.  I do not think that it is an action which comes within  \n         the arbitration clause at all, and therefore I think there was no power to  \n         stay it, and ought not to have been stayed.  I think the master proceeded on  \n         a wrong basis  He said : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">         &quot;   I do not think this is a well-founded action.   I think there is no case of  \n         fraud, and therefore I will stay the action and send it to arbitration - that is  \n         to say, I will send to arbitration something that the arbitrator has no power  \n         to deal with at all. &quot;  \n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 27/08/2013 21:19:21 :::</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">                                                  .. 29 ..                               chs-163.09.jsxw\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     \n             BANKES,  L.J.   - I  agree.    It  seems  to  me  that a  person  who  takes  out  a  \n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">             summons such as this to stay proceedings on the ground that the question  \n             which is thereby raised ought to be referred to arbitration as, the first step,  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                         \n             to establish that the matter in question in the legal proceedings is one which  \n             is withing the scope of the submission to arbitration, and that is the real  \n             question which has to be decided here.  In the first place, one has to see what  \n             the   matter   in   question   in   the   legal   proceedings   is,   and   then   to   consider  \n             whether it comes within the scope of the submission to arbitration.  Here the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                        \n             plaintiff has brought an action and endorsed his claim upon the writ.  The  \n             defendants without waiting for the statement of claim which I think they  \n             might have done, have elected to take out a summons at once to stay the  \n             action of which the claim has been indorsed on the writ.  I do not think the  \n             plaintiff ought to be in a better position he had amended the writ.   At the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n             same time, I do not think that the amendment alters the character of the  \n             claim.  It is a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation whereby  \n                                \n             the plaintiff was induced to enter into a contract, and there are claims for  \n             consequential relief, one of which put in the form of a claim for work and  \n             labour done, but the essence of the claim is that the plaintiff is asserting that  \n             he was induced by fraud to enter into the contract, and that therefore the  \n                               \n             contract never was binding.  If that is the nature of the claim, it seems to me  \n             plain that it does not come within the scope of the submission to arbitration,  \n             and it is no answer to say that the plaintiff has mistaken his remedy and  \n             ought not to have brought this form of claim which he cannot substantiate,  \n             and,   if  you   look   into  it,   you   will   find   that   he   ought   to  have   brought   a  \n          \n\n\n             different action altogether, and, if he had, it would have been plain that it  \n             came within the submission to arbitration.&quot;\n</blockquote>       \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">        (d)   Mr   Cama   also   placed   reliance   upon   the   Judgment   of \n\n        Queen&#x27;s Bench Division in case of   Government of Gibraltar  \n\n\n\n\n\n        Vs.

But where two courts have  \n     jurisdiction under the Code to try a suit or proceeding an agreement between  \n     the parties that the dispute between them shall be tried in one of such courts  \n     is   not   contrary   to   public   policy   nor   does   such   an   agreement   contravene  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                \n     <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_49\">Section  28</a>  of the Contract Act. In that case also there was a Clause in the  \n     agreement being Clause No. 13 which provided that not with striding the  \n     place where the work under the contract was to be executed the contract shall  \n     be deemed to have been entered into between the parties at Bombay and the  \n     court in Bombay alone shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate thereon.

In   a   civil   revision   filed   by   the  \n     respondent the Allahabad High Court held that the courts at Bombay had  \n     also jurisdiction and in of Clause 13 of the agreement the jurisdiction of the  \n     courts at Varanasi stood ousted.

The appeal was accordingly dismissed. This view was reiterated  \n     by this Court in Globe Transport Corporation Triveni Engineering Works and  \n   \n\n\n\n     Anr.

Reliance has been placed by learned Counsel for the appellant on these two  \n     decisions and if it can be held that the courts at Bombay also had jurisdiction  \n     in the two suits <a href=\"/doc/1548537/\" id=\"a_54\">referred to above</a> the judgments appealed against will have to  \n\n\n\n\n\n     be set aside on the basis of these decisions. The question, however, is as to  \n     whether in any of these two suits the courts at Bombay also had jurisdiction  \n     apart from the courts within whose jurisdiction the goods were entrusted to  \n     the   appellant   for   purposes   of   transport.   Having   given   our   anxious  \n     consideration to the matter we are of the opinion that the courts at Bombay  \n     in   these   two   cases   did   not   at   all   have   jurisdiction   and   consequently   the  \n\n\n\n\n\n     agreement between the parties conferring exclusive jurisdiction on courts at  \n     Bombay is of no avail.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">     9.

Clause (c) on the other hand refers to a court within the local  \n     limits of whose jurisdiction the cause of action wholly or in part arises.

Consequently Clause (c) is not attracted  \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 27/08/2013 21:19:21 :::</span>\n                                              .. 34 ..                              chs-163.09.jsxw\n\n\n        to   the   facts   of   these   cases.   What   has   been   urged   with   the   aid   of   the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                \n        Explanation  to  <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_56\">Section  20</a>  of  the  Code   is  that  since   the  appellant   has  its  \n        principal office in Bombay it shall be deemed to carry on business at Bombay  \n        and consequently the courts at Bombay will also have jurisdiction. On a plain  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                     \n        reading of the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_57\">Section  20</a>  of the Code we find an apparent  \n        fallacy in the aforesaid argument. The Explanation is in two parts, one before  \n        the word &quot;or&quot; occurring between the words &quot;office in India&quot; and the words &quot;in  \n        respect of&quot; and the other thereafter. The Explanation applies to a defendant  \n        which   is   a   corporation   which   term,   as   seen   above,   would   include   even   a  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n        company   such   as   the   appellant   in   the   instant   case.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1548537\" id=\"span_47\">The   first   part   of   the  \n        Explanation applies only to such a corporation which has its sole or principal  \n        office at a particular place. In that event the courts within whose jurisdiction  \n        the   sole   or   principal   office   of   the   defendant   is   situate   will   also   have  \n        jurisdiction inasmuch as even if the defendant may not be actually carrying  \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n        on business at that place, it will &quot;be deemed to carry on business&quot; at that  \n        place because of the fiction created by the Explanation. The latter part of the  \n                            \n        Explanation takes care of a case where the defendant does not have a sole  \n        office but has a principal office at one place and has also a subordinate office  \n        at   another   place.   The   words   &quot;at   such   place&quot;   occurring   at   the   end   of   the  \n        Explanation and the word &quot;or<a href=\"/doc/1548537/\" id=\"a_58\">&quot; <a href=\"/doc/1548537/\" id=\"a_59\">referred to above</a></a> which is disjunctive clearly  \n                           \n        suggest that if the case falls within the latter part of the Explanation it is not  \n        the Court within whose jurisdiction the principal office of the defendant is  \n        situate but the court within whose jurisdiction it has a subordinate office  \n        which alone shall have jurisdiction &quot;in respect of any cause of action arising  \n        at any place where it has also a subordinate office&quot;.</span>\n</p>      \n   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"96699\" id=\"span_48\">(g) Mr Cama also placed reliance on the Judgment of this Court \n\n     in   case   of  <a href=\"/doc/96699/\" id=\"a_60\">Kotak   Mahindra   Finance   Ltd.

There was a clause in the agreement providing  \n           \n\n\n             that   any   dispute   arising   out   of   that   sale   shall   be   subject   to   Kaira  \n             jurisdiction.   A   preliminary   issue   was   raised   whether   the   Court   had  \n        \n\n\n\n             jurisdiction. The trial Court found that it had no jurisdiction considering  \n             Clause   11.   In   an   Appeal   preferred   the   Madras   High   Court   allowed   the  \n             Appeal and set aside the judgment of the trial Court. That is how an S.L.P.  \n             was preferred before the Apex Court.</span> The Apex Court quoted with approval  \n\n\n\n\n\n             the observation of Lord Denning in Lee v.

The Apex  \n\n\n\n\n\n             Court noted that &quot;where there may be two or more competent courts which  \n             can entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause or action having  \n             arisen within the jurisdiction of one such Courts to try the dispute which  \n             might arise as between themselves, the agreement would be valid, however  \n             by such an agreement the parties could not confer jurisdiction on a Court  \n             where no part of cause of action had arisen.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1548537\" id=\"span_53\">We then have the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of M/s. <a href=\"/doc/1548537/\" id=\"a_67\">Patel  \n             Roadways Ltd.</a> (supra) which judgment is in respect of a cause arising after  \n             the amendment to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_68\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> by the Act of 1976.

This, it is clarified, will be the place where  \n          the   principal   office   is   situated   (whether   or   not   any   business   actually   is  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                       \n          carried off there) or the place where a business is carried on dividing rise to  \n          a cause of action (even though the principal office of the Corporation is not  \n          located there) so long as there is a subordinate office of the Corporation  \n          situated at such place. The linking together of the place where the cause of  \n          action   arises   with   the   place   where   a   subordinate   office   is   located   clearly  \n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n          shows   that   the   intention   of   the   legislature   was   that,   in   the   case   of   a  \n          corporation, for the purposes of Clause (a), the location of the subordinate  \n          office, within the local limits of which a cause of action arises, is to be the  \n          relevant place for the filing of a suit and not the principal lace of business. If  \n          the intention was that the location of the sole or principal office as well as  \n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n          the location of the subordinate office (within the limits of which a cause of  \n          action arises) are to be deemed to be places where the corporation is deemed  \n                             \n          to be carrying on business, the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; will not be there. Instead, the  \n          second part of the Explanation would have read&quot; and, in respect of any cause  \n          of action arising of any place where it has a subordinate office, also at such  \n          place&quot;.\n</p>                            \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_74\">    4.            If   the   law   declared   by   the   Apex   Court   is   now   so   understood   the  \n          question would be on the facts of the case as to which is the deemed place  \n          where   the   Corporation   carries   on   business.   Merely   because   the   plaintiff  \n          issued the notice of termination at Mumbai that by itself would not give a  \n           \n\n\n          cause for filing a suit in Mumbai if the defendants were not carrying on  \n          business in Mumbai or residing in Mumbai as admittedly the agreement was  \n        \n\n\n\n          entered   into   at   Chennai.   The   defendants   reside   or   carry   off   business   at  \n          Chennai.  The   clause  pertaining   to ouster   was   based  on  the  fact  that  the  \n          petitioners   were   deemed   to   be   carrying   on   business   at   Mumbai.   Once  \n          petitioner   had   a   subordinate   office   at   Chennai,   the   loan  was   granted   in  \n          Chennai as also the agreement was entered into at Chennai and it is that  \n\n\n\n\n\n          place where the cause of action has arisen which is the deemed place where  \n          the   petitioners   are   carrying   on   business.   If   that   be   so   the   clause   in   the  \n          agreement would be of no consequence considering <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_72\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_73\">28</a> of the  \n          Indian Contract Act and consequently, the preliminary objection raised that  \n          this Court has no jurisdiction, will have to be upheld.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1548537\" id=\"span_56\">5.

Para 24 of the plaint indicates that the plaintiff \n    has not only referred to the equipment lease agreement dated 30 th June, \n    1992 entered into  between the  parties  but has also led emphasis on the \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    said   agreement   and   stated   that   the   said   machine   was   the   sole   and \n                                 \n    exclusive property  of the defendant and under the  said agreement  the \n    plaintiff  had no right, title and interest therein except as lessee.

In my view, there is no substance in the submission made by \n    Mr. Cama, learned counsel for the plaintiff that no cause of action had \n    arisen at Chennai.

The learned counsel for the defendant in my view is \n    right in    placing reliance  on the supplementary agreement  which also \n    incorporated     identical   clause   recording   that   in   the     event   of   dispute \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    under this or any of the agreements entered into between the Lessor and \n                                 \n    the Lessee in connection with the Lease of the equipment mentioned in \n    the Schedule A the Courts in Madras alone will have jurisdiction.   It is \n                                \n    not   denied   by   the     plaintiff     that   the     supervision,   management   and \n    control of the said equipment was carried out by the defendant from   its \n    registered office at Chennai. In my view, Mr. Cama is not correct in his \n        \n\n    submission that     no cause of action had arisen at Chennai. It is not in \n    dispute that defendant had its subordinate office at Mumbai. On perusal \n     \n\n\n\n    of the agreements  as well as correspondence it is clear that the part of \n    cause of action had arisen at Mumbai and at the same time  some  part of \n\n\n\n\n\n    cause of action  had also arisen  at Chennai. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">    10.

It is   submission of the plaintiff  that merely  because there \n    is reference to the agreement made in the plaint  vaguely,  it cannot be \n    considered that the claim has been made under the said agreement.

The submission of the plaintiff \n    is that the claim for damages made by the plaintiff in the said suit is in \n    the nature of tort   and   not under any provisions of the   contract. It is \n\n\n\n\n                                                                \n    also   submitted   by     the   plaintiff     that   since   there   is   no   other   lease \n    agreement entered into between the parties, no reliance can be   placed \n    by the defendant on the     expression &quot; in connection with the lease  of \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    the equipment&quot;.

By the said supplementary agreement schedule in \n                                \n    making payment by the Plaintiff  was revised. It is not in dispute that the \n    lease of the equipment was     granted in favour of the   plaintiff     not \n    under any other agreement other than these two agreements.     In my \n        \n\n    view expression   &quot; under this agreement&quot; or &quot;in connection therewith&quot; \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">    cannot be read disjunctively.  In the absence of agreement between the \n     \n\n\n\n    parties,   no   claim       as   made   by   the   plaintiff     would   have   arisen.   On \n    perusal of the plaint, it is clear that the entire       claim is made in the \n\n\n\n\n\n    plaint based on the agreements   entered into between the parties. It is \n    pleaded by the plaintiff  in the plaint and in  particular paragraph 24 that \n    under   the   said   agreement,     machine     was       the   sole   and   exclusive \n    property of the defendant and the plaintiff   was regularly paying lease \n\n\n\n\n\n    rentals under the said agreement to the defendant. It is the case of the \n    plaintiff that though plaintiff    contacted the defendant with  a request \n    to take necessary steps to remove the said machine from the premises of \n    the   associate   company   of   the   plaintiff     situated   at   Ahmednagar, \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 27/08/2013 21:19:21 :::</span>\n                                               .. 45 ..                       chs-163.09.jsxw\n\n\n    defendant failed to take the   possession of the said machine, resultantly \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                         \n    the   plaintiff   could   not   put   the   said   machine   to   use   and   suffered \n\n\n\n\n                                                                 \n    damages due to loss of income  resulted from such  failure on the part of \n    the defendant in taking possession of the  said equipment.  In my view, \n    court has to see the substance of the claim and not how the  claim is \n\n\n\n\n                                                                \n    claimed.    Merely because there is no provision under the contract that \n    the     defendant   is   liable   to      make     any  payment   for   damages  to  the \n    plaintiff, the fact remains that the plaintiff     has alleged breaches on the  \n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    part of the  defendant under the said agreement. The  claim in my view \n                                \n    thus arises   under the   said agreement or in any event, the claim for \n    damages is in connection with the lease of the equipment mentioned in \n                               \n    the   agreement.   The   entire   clause   i.e.   clause   38   has   to   be   raed \n    harmoniously  and   not disjunctively  to ascertain  the    intention  of the \n    parties. In my view,  intention of the  parties was very clear  that where \n        \n\n    the dispute   was   under the   said agreement entered into between the \n    parties or was in connection with the lease of the equipment mentioned \n     \n\n\n\n    in schedule A, the courts in  Madras alone will have jurisdiction.      \n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">    11.

It is the bundle of facts which taken with the \n\n\n\n\n                                                                  \n    law applicable to them gives the plaintiff   a right to relief against the \n    defendant.  It is held that it is not limited to   to the actual infringement  \n    of the  right sued on but includes all the material facts on which it is \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    founded.     The   Supreme   Court   has   held   that   if   in     law   several   courts \n                                  \n    would have jurisdiction and the parties have agreed to submit to one of \n    these jurisdictions and not to other or others of them, it cannot be said \n                                 \n    that there is total ouster of jurisdiction. Whether the parties to contract \n    agreed to submit the dispute  arising   from it to   particular jurisdiction, \n    it would otherwise also  had both jurisdiction.   Therefore, the agreement \n        \n\n    to the extent  they agreed not to submit to other jurisdiction  cannot be \n    said   to   be     void   as   against   public   policy.

Thus in   my view this \n    court has  no jurisdiction to entertain, try and dispose of the  suit.

Calcutta High Court has held that cause of action <a href=\"/doc/265580/\" id=\"a_118\">in that case</a> \n    is   based   only   upon   tort   and   tort   alone   which   has   got   no   connection \n     \n\n\n\n    directly or indirectly with the contract itself.   On perusal of the plaint \n    and correspondence alongwith lease agreement, in this case it is clear \n\n\n\n\n\n    that the plaint in this suit proceeds on the premise that the defendant has \n    failed to comply with its obligation under the agreement in question.  In \n    my   view   on   bare   reading   of   the   plaint   alongwith   documents   and \n    agreement, it cannot be said that the claim is made only upon tort and \n\n\n\n\n\n    tort alone and has no connection of whatsoever nature whether directly \n    or indirectly with the lease agreement.

However,   it   was   clarified   that   the   said   claim   was   not   in \n        \n\n    relation   or   in   connection   with   the   contract   within   the   meaning   of \n    arbitration   clause.
