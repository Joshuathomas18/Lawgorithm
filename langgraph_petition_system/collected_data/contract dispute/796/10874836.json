The applicant, a partnership firm engaged in the business of\ncivil construction, is empanelled with the Uttarakhand State\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                     2</span>\n\n\n\n\nInfrastructure Development Corporation Limited as a Class-II\ncontractor. It is the applicant&#x27;s case that M/s Tarunjot Singh and\nothers had approached them for developing and constructing a\nresidential school in the name of Ecole Global International Girls\nSchool at Horawalla village, Dehradun; an agreement was executed\nbetween them on 22.01.2011; the school management had, thereafter,\nawarded them the work of lay-out, basic infrastructure and\nlandscaping, etc for which an agreement was executed on 10.08.2011;\nand the said agreement dated 10.08.2011 required the work to be\ncompleted before 09.08.2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    There is a dispute between the parties regarding the change in\nthe drawings and specifications.        The respondent is said to have\nstarted running the school at the site from April, 2012, and to have\ncommenced the admission process. In terms of Clause 14 of the\nAgreement, the applicant was required, on completion of the work, to\nraise a final bill on the respondent. It is the applicant&#x27;s case that they\ncompleted the construction work in late 2014; despite raising running\nbills regularly, the respondent did not clear their bills on time, and\nfailed to make payment as per the agreed terms between the parties;\nthey raised their final bill on 02.02.2016 for Rs. 2,61,67,423/-; as the\nrespondent failed to make payment, they issued two reminders on 1st\nMarch, 2016 and 26th March, 2016 requesting the respondent to clear\nthe final bill raised by them; a legal notice was sent calling upon the\nrespondent to make payment of Rs. 1,05,88,163/- after adjusting the\npart payment made by the respondent and, on failure to make\npayment, to agree to the appointment of an arbitrator in terms of the\ndispute resolution mechanism in accordance with the arbitration\nclause of the agreement dated 22.01.2011, and under <a href=\"/doc/138599/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 21</a> of the\n1996 Act; the Architect, appointed by the respondent, was required to\nact as an arbitrator, and his decision was final and binding between\nthe parties; in terms of the 2015 amendment to the 1996 Act,\nappointment of the Architect as an arbitrator is restricted; the\napplicant was not willing to give their consent for appointment of the\narchitect as an arbitrator; they had, therefore, requested the respondent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\n\n\n\nto give their consent for the appointment of Sri O.P.Bhatia, a retired\nAssistant Director General, CPWD as an arbitrator to resolve the\ndisputes between the parties; they had strong objections to the\nappointment of the Architect as an arbitrator; he was regularly\nworking with the respondent on various projects, and was also under\nthe direct control of the respondent; while the 30 days&#x27; notice period\nexpired on 08.06.2016, the respondent had sent a reply, to the legal\nnotice dated 31.05.2016, contending that the claim of the applicant\nwas an afterthought; they claimed compensation for the delay in\nconstruction; and, since the respondent did not agree to the\nappointment of an arbitrator, the applicant was constrained to invoke\nthe jurisdiction of this Court by way of the present application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.    In the counter affidavit, filed by the respondent, it is stated that\nthe arbitration application, for appointment of an arbitrator, was\nmisconceived and was not maintainable; there was no arbitration\nclause in the agreement executed between the parties; the architect\nwas connected with the execution of the work, and the drawings for\nthe execution of the work was to be supplied by him; Clause 31 of the\nContract specifically provided that, in case any variation from the\ncontract drawings or contract bill was necessitated, the contractor\nshould give notice to the Architect for instructions regarding matters\nspecified therein; the agreement provided that, in the event of any\ndispute arising out of, or in any way connected, with the work, the\narchitect shall be the final authority; there was no arbitration clause in\nthe agreement as was being misconstrued by the applicant; and the\narbitration application was not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The counter affidavit, thereafter, details the stand of the\nrespondent on merits. It is, however, unnecessary for us to refer to\nthem in detail, and it would suffice to note the stand of the respondent\nthat the applicant had not raised any final bill on 02.02.2016 for a sum\nof Rs. 2,61,67,423/-; the said document dated 02.02.2016 was\nunilaterally prepared by the applicant as an afterthought; Clause 14 of\nthe agreement stipulated that the final bill had to be prepared within\nseven days from the completion of the work; no amount was payable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    4</span>\n\n\n\n\nto the applicant; there was no question of the respondent either\nmaking any such payment or to give its consent for appointment of an\narbitrator; no dues are payable to the applicant by the respondent;\nthere was only a provision for resolution of the dispute through the\narchitect; in the present case the architect had already given his\ndecision on 15.07.2016; there was no arbitration clause in the\nagreement; Sri O.P. Bhatia is associated with the applicant, and it was\nfor this reason that the applicant had nominated him as an arbitrator;\nsince there is no arbitration clause, the appointment of Sri O.P.Bhatia\nwas neither warranted nor feasible; the Architect was in no way\nconnected with them; he was an independent professional and was not\nsubordinate or under the influence of the respondent; even if the said\nclause is considered to be an arbitration agreement, since the Architect\nis named in the Contract, the disputes can only be referred to the\narbitrator named in the agreement; the claims of the applicant were\nstale, and were also not arbitrable; they are malafide and an\nafterthought; since there is no arbitration clause in the agreement, the\napplicant was at liberty to approach the appropriate court for\nadjudication of their claims questioning the decision of the architect\ndated 15.07.2016; and the respondent seeks dismissal of the\napplication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.    Elaborate submissions, both oral and written, were made by Mr.\nArvind Vashistha, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\napplicant, and Mr. T.S. Bindra, learned counsel for the respondent. It\nis convenient to examine the rival submissions, urged on either side,\nunder different heads.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">I.    IS THE CLAUSE, AFTER CLAUSE 31 OF THE\n      AGREEMENT, AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    Mr. Arvind Vashist, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the applicant, would submit that clause 14 of the agreement\nstipulates that the disputed amount, due under the contract, should be\ndealt with in terms of the agreement; the only clause, dealing with\ndisputes, is the unnumbered Clause after Clause 31 which provides\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe following (a) a Private Tribunal to decide the disputes, (b) the\ndecision of the Private Tribunal being final and binding upon the\nparties, and (c) parties being &quot;consensus ad-idem&quot;; the applicant\ninvoked the unnumbered clause after Clause 31 seeking appointment\nof an arbitrator vide notice dated 06.05.2016; the respondent failed to\nappoint an arbitrator; the unnumbered clause, after clause 31 of the\nagreement, satisfies the requirement of an arbitration clause; there is\nno specific form and manner of an arbitration clause, the parties are\nfree to choose the manner and procedure for the same; when Clause\n14 is read with the unnumbered clause after clause 31 of the\nagreement, the agreement contemplates an element of reference; and\nthe named arbitrator is required to act on the basis of the reference of\nthe dispute, which emerges out of clause 14, after hearing the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.    On the other hand Mr. T.S. Bindra, learned counsel for the\nrespondent, would submit that the subject clause limits the role of an\narchitect only to disputes relating to the work, and is not an all\nencompassing clause covering all disputes (past, present or future)\narising out of the contract; this limited sphere is also a pointer to the\nfact that, since the Architect was engaged only to supervise the work,\nhis instructions/decisions relating thereto were contemplated; at best it\ncan be said that the architect was a person chosen by the parties as an\nin-house or departmental dispute resolution mechanism, for sorting\nout problems relating to the execution of work; the subject clause does\nnot provide for a reference of the disputes; it does not require the\narchitect to decide the disputes by way of a judicial/adjudicatory\nprocess after taking evidence or by providing an opportunity to the\nparties to put up their case; this fact is clear from the decisions of the\narchitect which are on record; there ought to be a provision for\nreference to arbitration, for being construed as an arbitration clause;\nparties should contemplate a judicial determination / opportunity of\nhearing and not ministerial work; and there should be consensus ad-\nidem regarding referring the disputes to arbitration.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"161139889\" id=\"span_6\">9.    It is useful at the outset to take note of the attributes of an\narbitration agreement.     <a href=\"/doc/78032017/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 2(a)</a> of the 1996 Act defines\n&#x27;arbitration agreement&#x27; to mean &#x27;a written agreement to submit\npresent or future differences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is\nnamed therein or not&#x27;. Arbitration is a process by which a dispute is\nresolved by an arbitrator chosen or acceptable to both sides under an\narbitration agreement between the two parties. (<a href=\"/doc/161139889/\" id=\"a_5\">South Delhi\nMunicipal Corporation vs. SMS AAMW Tollways Private Ltd1</a>).\nA clause in a contract can be construed as an &quot;arbitration agreement&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"64556\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1913246\" id=\"span_8\">only if an agreement to refer disputes or differences to arbitration is\nexpressly or impliedly spelt out from the clause. (<a href=\"/doc/1913246/\" id=\"a_6\">Jagdish Chander v.\nRamesh Chander2</a>; <a href=\"/doc/64556/\" id=\"a_7\">State of Orissa v. Damodar Das3</a>). <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 7</a> of\nthe 1996 Act makes it clear that unless an arbitration agreement\nstipulates that the parties agree to submit all or certain disputes which\nhave arisen or which may arise in respect of defined legal relationship,\nwhether contractual or not, there cannot be a reference to an arbitrator.\nTo elaborate, it conveys that there must be an intention, expressing the\nconsensual acceptance, to refer the disputes to an arbitrator. In the\nabsence of an arbitration clause in an agreement, as defined under\nsub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 7</a>, the dispute/disputes arising between the\nparties cannot be referred to the arbitral tribunal for adjudication of\nthe disputes.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133804913\" id=\"span_9\">(<a href=\"/doc/133804913/\" id=\"a_10\">Karnataka Power Transmission Corpn. Ltd. Vs.\nDeepak Cables (India) Ltd4</a>).</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10.   The arbitration agreement must expressly, or by necessary\nimplication, spell out that there is an agreement to refer any dispute or\ndifference for an arbitration, and the Clause in the contract must\ncontain such an agreement. In its absence, it is difficult to spell out a\nreference to arbitration to resolve the dispute or difference between\nthe parties. (South Delhi Municipal Corporation1; Damodar Das3).\nThe existence of an arbitration agreement, as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 7</a>\nof the 1996 Act, is a condition precedent for the exercise of power to\nappoint an arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11</a> of the Act. It\nis not permissible to appoint an arbitrator to adjudicate disputes\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nbetween the parties in the absence of an arbitration agreement or\nwithout mutual consent. (Jagdish Chander2).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"133070\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"48449\" id=\"span_12\">11.   The term &#x27;arbitration&#x27; is not required to be specifically\nmentioned for it to be construed as an arbitration agreement.

Even if the words &quot;arbitration&quot; and\n&quot;Arbitral Tribunal (or arbitrator)&quot; are not used, it does not detract\nfrom the clause being an arbitration agreement if it has the attributes\nor elements of an arbitration agreement. They are: (a) The agreement\nshould be in writing. (b) The parties should have agreed to refer any\ndisputes (present or future) between them to the decision of a private\ntribunal. (c) The private tribunal should be empowered to adjudicate\nupon the disputes in an impartial manner, giving due opportunity to\nthe parties to put forth their case before it. (d) The parties should have\nagreed that the decision of the private tribunal in respect of the\ndisputes will be binding on them; and (e) the parties must be ad-idem.</span></span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"936043\" id=\"span_13\">(Jagdish Chander2; <a href=\"/doc/936043/\" id=\"a_15\">Mallikarjun v. Gulbarga University7</a>; Encon\nBuilders (I) (P) Ltd5).      If the main attribute, of an arbitration\nagreement namely, consensus ad idem to refer the disputes to\narbitration, is missing it is not an arbitration agreement, as defined\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 7</a> of the 1996 Act (Jagdish Chander2).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1777887\" id=\"span_14\">12.   Mustill and Boyd, in their book on Commercial Arbitration,\n2nd Edn., have listed some of the attributes which must be present for\nan agreement to be considered as an arbitration agreement, though\nthese attributes in themselves may not be sufficient. They have also\nlisted certain other considerations which are relevant to this question,\nalthough not conclusive on the point. Among the attributes which\nmust be present for an agreement to be considered an arbitration\nagreement are: (1) The arbitration agreement must contemplate that\nthe decision of the tribunal will be binding on the parties to the\nagreement, (2) the jurisdiction of the tribunal to decide the rights of\nparties must be derived either from the consent of the parties or from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                    8</span>\n\n\n\n\nan order of the court or from a statute, the terms of which make it\nclear that the process is to be an arbitration, (3) the agreement must\ncontemplate that substantive rights of parties will be determined by\nthe agreed tribunal, (4) the tribunal will determine the rights of the\nparties in an impartial and judicial manner with the tribunal owing an\nequal obligation of fairness towards both sides, (5) the agreement of\nthe parties to refer their disputes to the decision of the tribunal must\nbe intended to be enforceable in law, and (6) the agreement must\ncontemplate that the tribunal will make a decision upon a dispute\nwhich is already formulated at the time when a reference is made to\nthe tribunal. The other factors which are relevant include, whether the\nagreement contemplates that the tribunal will receive evidence from\nboth sides and hear their contentions or at least give the parties an\nopportunity to put them forward; whether the wording of the\nagreement is consistent or inconsistent with the view that the process\nwas intended to be an arbitration, and whether the agreement requires\nthe tribunal to decide the dispute according to law. (<a href=\"/doc/1777887/\" id=\"a_17\">K.K. Modi v.\nK.N. Modi8</a>; Dina Nath6).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">13.   While there is no specific form of an arbitration agreement, the\nwords used should disclose a determination and obligation to go to\narbitration and not merely contemplate the possibility of going for\narbitration. (Dina Nath6; Jagdish Chander2).        Where the clause,\nrelating to settlement of disputes, contains words which specifically\nexclude any of the attributes of an arbitration agreement or contains\nanything that detracts from an arbitration agreement, it will not be an\narbitration agreement. (Dina Nath6).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">14.   Where there is a specific and direct expression of intent to have\nthe disputes settled by arbitration, it is not necessary to set out the\nattributes of an arbitration agreement to make it one such. (Jagdish\nChander2). For the purpose of constituting a valid arbitration\nagreement, it is not necessary that the conditions as regards adduction\nof evidence by the parties or giving an opportunity of hearing to them\nmust be specifically mentioned therein. Such conditions are implicit in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                    9</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe   decision-making    process   in   the   arbitration   proceedings.\nCompliance with principles of natural justice inheres in an arbitration\nprocess. An arbitration clause does not necessitate spelling out of a\nduty on the part of the arbitrator to hear both parties before deciding\nthe question before him. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1707042\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"344153\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1979603\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1674380\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"102212981\" id=\"span_21\">The expression &quot;decision&quot; subsumes\nadjudication of the dispute. (Mallikarjun7).       Where there is no\nprovision either for reference of disputes to a private forum, or for a\nfair and judicious enquiry, or for a decision which is final and binding\non the parties to the dispute, there is no arbitration agreement.

Since the respondent claims that the subject clause is not an\narbitration clause and only provides for &quot;expert determination&quot;, it is\nnecessary to understand what these words &quot;expert determination&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196898200\" id=\"span_22\">mean. Unlike arbitration, the idea of expert determination is that the\nperson does all things necessary during the implementation of the\ncontract between the parties to see that the contract gets successfully\ncompleted. (<a href=\"/doc/196898200/\" id=\"a_23\">Shyam Sunder Agarwal v. P. Narotham Rao15</a>). If the\nwording of the agreement is inconsistent with the view that the\nagreement intended that disputes be decided by arbitration (Shyam\nSunder Agarwal15), the clause does not contain any express\narbitration agreement, nor can such an agreement be spelt out from its\nterms by implication, there being no mention in it of any dispute,\nmuch less of a reference thereof, it would be a provision for expert\ndetermination.

Bearing these principles in mind, the contents of clauses 14 and\n31 and the clause thereafter, under the agreement entered into between\nthe parties on 10.08.2011, must be noted as reliance is placed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                     10</span>\n\n\n\n\nthereupon, on behalf of the applicant, to contend that the clause after\nclause 31 is the arbitration agreement. The said agreement records\nthat the owner (respondent herein) had appointed M/s Architect\nStudio represented by Sri Amardeep Singh, as the architect of the\nproject; and the architect was required to furnish detailed drawings as\nand when required for the proper completion of the work.

After\npayment of the amount of the final bill, payables as aforesaid has been\nmade, the contractor may, if he desires, reconsider his position in\nrespect of the disputed portion of the bill (final) and if he fails to do so\nwithin 90 days his disputed claim shall be dealt with as provided in\nthe contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       (31) Statutory obligations, notices.-The contractor shall\ncomply with and give all notices required by any government\nauthority, and instrument, rule or order made under any Act of\nparliament or any regulation or Bye-law of any local authority relating\nto the work or with whose system the same is or will be connected.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">The contractor before making any variation from the contract\ndrawings or contract bill necessitated by such compliance shall\ngive to the architects a written notice specifying and giving the\nsaid written notice the contractor does not receive any\ninstructions in regard to the matters therein specified, he shall\nproceed with the work confirming to act of parliament, instrument,\nrule, order, regulations or Bye-law in questioned any variation there\nby necessitated shall be deemed to be a variation required by the\narchitect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      In the event of any dispute arising out or in any way\nconnected with the work, the Architect shall be final authority to\ndecide and whose decision shall be final and binding to both\nparties.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">17.   While the clause below Clause 31 is contended by the applicant\nto be an arbitration clause, the respondent would contend that this\nclause, when read with others, provides only for &quot;expert\ndetermination&quot;, and not for arbitration. In examining whether the\nsubject clause is an arbitration agreement or is a provision for expert\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                    11</span>\n\n\n\n\ndetermination, the relevant clauses of the agreement must be read-\ntogether as a whole, for that would make the role assigned to the\nArchitect, under the agreement, clear. Clause (1) of the agreement\ndated 22.01.2011 reserves, among others, the right to alter the\ndrawings and the nature of the work, and of adding or omitting any\npart of the work, totally or otherwise, on the architect. Clause (4) not\nonly requires all material and workmanship to be in accordance with\nthe Architect&#x27;s instructions, but also requires the contractor, at the\nrequest of the Architect, to furnish him with all invoices, accounts,\nreceipts and other vouchers to prove that the materials comply\ntherewith. Clause (4) further requires the contractor, at his own cost,\nto arrange for and/or carry out tests of any material which the\nArchitect may require/decide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">18.   Clause (7) of the subject agreement requires the contractor to\ngive, not less than seven days&#x27;, notice in writing to the Architect\nbefore covering up, or otherwise placing beyond the reach of\nmeasurements, any work in order that the same may be measured and\nthe correct dimensions taken. Clause (7) enables the Architect to\ninspect the work and confers power on him, in case he is satisfied that\ncertain works have been covered without notice to him, to uncover the\nsame at the contractor&#x27;s expenses. Clause (8) confers power on the\nArchitect, during the progress of the works, to order, in writing, the\nremoval from the work of any material which, in the opinion of the\nArchitect, are not in accordance with the specifications or his\ninstructions; for the substitution of proper materials; and for the\nremoval and proper re-election of any work executed with material or\nworkmanship not in accordance with the drawings and specifications\nor instructions. In case of default on the part of the contractor, Clause\n(8) confers power on the Architect to have the owner employ other\npersons to carry out the same, and for all expenses, consequent thereto\nas certified by the Architect, to be borne by the contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">19.   Clause (10) of the agreement requires the contractor to\nindemnify the Architect against all claims which may be made against\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                     12</span>\n\n\n\n\nhim by any member of the public, or other third party, in respect of\nanything which may arise in respect of the work. Clause (13)\nstipulates that 75% of the amount specified by the Architect shall be\npaid by the owner within seven days from the date of submission of\nthe Bill, and the remaining 25% within three weeks of submission of\nthe Bill. Clause (14), on which great emphasis is placed by Mr.\nArvind Vashist, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the applicant,\nrequires the final bill to be submitted by the contractor within one\nweek of virtual completion of the work. The said clause further\nstipulates that no further claims shall be made by the contractor after\nsubmission of the final bill, and these (i.e. claims) shall be deemed to\nhave been waived and extinguished. Payment of those items of the bill\nin respect of which there is no dispute, and of items of dispute for\nquantities and the rates as approved by the Architect, shall be made\nwithin six weeks from the date of receipt of the bill from the\ncontractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">20.   In terms of Clause (14) of the agreement, where there is no\ndispute with respect to any of the items of the final bill, payment is\nrequired to be made within six weeks. For such of those items in\ndispute, if the quantities and the rates are approved by the Architect,\npayment of such items should also be made within the six weeks&#x27;\nperiod. A 90 days&#x27; grace period is given, after the payment of the\namount of the final bill, for the contractor to reconsider his position in\nrespect of the disputed portion of the bill. It is only if he fails to do so\nwithin 90 days&#x27;, is his disputed claim required to be dealt with as\nprovided under the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">21.   Clause (31) of the agreement relates to statutory obligations and\nnotices and, in terms thereof, the contractor shall, before making any\nvariation from the contract drawings or contract bill necessitated by\nthe compliance of any statutory notice, give the Architect a written\nnotice, and if contractor does not receive any instructions in this\nregard, he is entitled to proceed with the work confirming to the Rule\nor bye-law in question. The clause below Clause (31) only stipulates\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                    13</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat the Architect shall be final authority to decide any dispute arising\nout of, or in any way connected with, the work and his decision shall\nbe final and binding on both the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">22.   A conjoint reading of Clause (14) with the clause below Clause\n(31) of the agreement, would make it clear that, with regards the\ndisputed portion of the Bill, for which the contractor has not\nreconsidered his position, his claim is required to be decided by the\nArchitect again, and nothing more. The decision of the Architect, with\nrespect to those disputed portions of the Bill, is given finality. As a\nresult, if the Architect does not agree with the contractor&#x27;s reiteration\nof the disputed claim, the aforesaid conditions of the agreement do not\nprovide for any further remedy, and in such an event the contractor\ncan only avail his common law remedy of a Suit before a Civil Court\nof competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">23.   The words &quot;Final and Binding on both the parties&quot;, in the\nclause below Clause 31, does not make the Architect an arbitrator. All\nthat the said clause does is to confer power on the Architect to\ndetermine once again the disputed claim regarding the final bill of the\ncontractor. Indisputably, there is no recital in the above clause of the\ncontract to refer any dispute or difference, present or future, to\narbitration. The clause does not reflect the consensus ad-idem between\nthe applicant and the respondent to refer the dispute to arbitration. It\ndoes not also require the architect to determine the rights of the parties\nin an impartial and judicial manner owing an equal fairness to both\nsides. Nor does it provide for the decision of the architect to be\nenforceable in law. There is no specific provision in the said clause\nfor the architect to receive evidence from both sides, hear their\ncontention or to give the parties an opportunity to put them forward.\nNone of the attributes of a valid arbitration agreement are to be found\nin the clause below Clause 31 of the agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">24.   A clause in the contract cannot be split into two parts so as to\nconsider one part to give rise to difference or dispute and another part\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                    14</span>\n\n\n\n\nrelating to execution of the work, its workmanship, etc. A clause in\nthe contract must be read as a whole. (Damodar Das3; P.\nDasaratharama Reddy Complex9). A reading of the agreement as a\nwhole leaves no manner of doubt that it only invests the Architect\nwith the powers to smoothly implement the work mentioned in the\nagreement, and not to decide the disputes between the parties as an\narbitrator. (Shyam Sunder Agarwal15).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">II. DISTINCTION BETWEEN ARBITRATION AND EXPERT\nDETERMINATION:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">25.   Mr. Arvind Vashist, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the applicant, would submit that the Architect, as\ncontemplated in the Agreement, has a dual role; the first one comes to\nan end on completion of the work as per the drawings given by the\nArchitect, and further to quantify the rates and quantities for\nvariations in the execution of the work, from the contemplated work,\nunder the contract; thereafter, as per the completed work, the\nApplicant (Contractor) is required to raise the final bill, which would\nthen be considered by the respondent; the respondent, on its own\nassessment, is then required to quantify the final Bill and clear the\nsame to the extent it is deemed admitted; the balance, if any, is\nrequired to be decided by the Arbitrator (Architect) whose decision\nshall be final and binding on the parties; the role of the architect as an\nexpert comes to an end when the work is completed as per the\ndrawings provided by the Architect; the dues are required to be\ncleared by the respondent, independent of the Architect; any dispute,\nthereafter, between the applicant and the respondent must be decided\nby the Architect in a judicious and independent manner; and this duly\nsatisfies the requirement of a valid and binding Arbitration\nAgreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">26.   On the other hand Mr. T.S. Bindra, learned counsel for the\nrespondent, would submit that the subject clause is not an Arbitration\nclause, but is a clause for &quot;Expert Determination&quot; for the following\nreasons i.e. (a) the Architect was specifically engaged as an Expert,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                    15</span>\n\n\n\n\nand had a supervisory role in the execution of the works; (b) a\ndistinction needs to be drawn between such cases and those where an\nEngineer, though an employee of the Government (one of the parties\nto the contract) but has not supervised or dealt with the work, may yet\nbe construed to be an arbitrator, since it cannot be inferred that he\nwould be biased, as he has not dealt with the work; (c) the paragraph\njust preceding the Clause, which is the subject matter of interpretation,\nis relevant; this clause provides that, before making any variation\nfrom the contract drawings or contract bill, the Contractor was bound\nto give a written notice to the architect; this makes it clear that the\nArchitect was engaged as an Expert; the other clauses of the\nAgreement make it clear that the Architect was engaged to supervise\nthe work, he was assigned a supervisory role relating to the execution\nof the work, like issuance of detailed drawings, measurement of work,\ninstruct removal of material not in accordance with the specifications,\nsubstitution of proper material, removal and proper re-erection of\nwork etc; and a conjoint reading of various clauses of the agreement\nmakes it clear that the Architect was an expert who was assigned a\nsupervisory role in the contract; he was expected to give his decision,\nfrom time to time, during various stages of the work as an Expert, and\nnot as a Judge; a clause, empowering one of the party&#x27;s supervisor\noverseeing and having jurisdiction over the work, cannot be held to be\nan Arbitration clause; and there can be no arbitration clause if the\nperson referred to has dealt with the work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">27.   In support of their contention that the agreement provides only\nfor expert determination, reliance is placed on behalf of the\nrespondents on the e-mails dated 02.05.2012 and 15.05.2012. The\nArchitect informed the applicant, vide e-mail dated 02.05.2012, that\nthe work entrusted to them last year was far from completion; the\nwork was supposed to be handed over completely, in all respects, on\n31.12.2011; various jobs for which they had furnished all details had\nbeen delayed, like the dining halls, hostels, the academic block and\nthe administrative block; the purpose of the letter was not to repeat\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                    16</span>\n\n\n\n\nwhat had been orally stated, for the last nine months, which was to\nincrease manpower and to increase speed to complete the work for\nwhich details were with the contractor; the time taken for completing\nthe structures was far too much, leaving very little time to perform the\nfinishing works; the purpose of the letter was that, for about four\nmonths after the due completion date, nothing was completed to the\nexpected standards of workmanship, be it the floor tiling, the toilet\nfinishing, the paint quality, the external paving, the flush doors or the\nwindows; the list was never ending; nothing had been finished to the\nrequired standards; and he was unable to recommend to the owners\nthat the project had been handed over (not even partially) to their\nsatisfaction. The applicant was informed that, since the school\nholidays were from 15th May to 15th June, they should mobilize all\ntheir teams to complete the work in all respects; and, thereafter, the\nsame would be inspected by him or by his sub-architects.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">28.   In reply thereto, the applicant, by their e-mail dated 15.05.2012,\ninformed the Architect that they had received structural details of the\nquoted buildings as late as in November, 2011, and the stipulated\nmaterial for structural works as late as in December, 2011; the latest\ndrawings of the dining hall was received by them just a week ago; in\nsuch circumstances, it was illogical to lay the blame on them; they had\ncommunicated their requirement of drawings, details, decisions,\nmaterials and payment, numerous times in the past year, both verbally\nas well as through emails; procurement and delivery, of client\nsupplied material on site, was extremely tardy; the work was held up\nor slowed down due to unavailability of the stipulated materials as per\ntheir requirement; and the client was responsible for the supply of\nrequisite quantity of water for construction and labour on site, but they\nhad worked on the project under severe shortage of water since the\narrangements for water supply were inadequate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">29.   After highlighting several other deficiencies, the applicant\nfurther informed the Architect that they were working as per\ncontractual requirements, and had never stopped work on the project;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                    17</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">they had, as on date, adequate staff, manpower and plant and\nmachinery at the site to carry on the work; the finishing deadlines\nwere not solely their responsibility, and they needed the Architect&#x27;s\nco-operation with respect to some of the points, if the project had to\nbe completed to the satisfaction of all the parties involved; of primary\nimportance was the clearing of all buildings for final finish, and\ncomplete unrestricted access to all areas requiring work; all other sub-\ncontractors should vacate the buildings so that their work can proceed\nunhindered; any damage, resulting from other activities that were not\nunder their purview, would not be their responsibility; payment should\nbe made to them immediately; drawings, material and decisions\nrequired at the site should be made available at the site well in\nadvance; they had been denied access to many areas of the school,\nsince the school was still in session; and completion of the work by\nthem would depend on how quickly they were given unrestricted\naccess to the buildings after that date. The applicant assured the\nArchitect of their best co-operation. The correspondence between the\napplicant and the architect reveals the latter exercising supervision\nover the work, and the applicant acknowledging, albeit tacitly, the\narchitect&#x27;s supervisory role.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">30.   On the distinction between an expert determination and\narbitration, Russell on Arbitration, 21st Edn., states that the question\nwhether a contract&#x27;s chosen form of dispute resolution is expert\ndetermination or arbitration is a matter of construction of the contract,\nwhich involves an objective enquiry into the intention of the parties.\nFirst, there are the express words of the disputes clause. If specific\nwords such as &#x27;arbitrator&#x27;, &#x27;arbitral tribunal&#x27;, &#x27;arbitration&#x27; or the\nformula &#x27;as an expert and not as an arbitrator&#x27; are used to describe the\nmanner in which the dispute resolver is to act, they are likely to be\npersuasive although not always conclusive. Where there is no express\nwording, the court will refer to certain guidelines. Of these, the most\nimportant used to be whether there was an &#x27;issue&#x27; between the parties\nsuch as the value of an asset on which they had not taken defined\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                   18</span>\n\n\n\n\npositions, in which case the procedure was held to be expert\ndetermination; or a &#x27;formulated dispute&#x27; between the parties where\ndefined positions had been taken, in which case the procedure was\nheld to be an arbitration. This imprecise concept is still being relied\non. It is unsatisfactory because some parties to the contract\ndeliberately choose expert determination for dispute resolution. The\nnext guideline is the judicial function of an arbitral tribunal as\nopposed to the expertise of the expert. An arbitral tribunal arrives at\nits decision on the evidence and submissions of the parties and must\napply the law or, if the parties agree, on other consideration. An\nexpert, unless it is agreed otherwise, makes his own enquiries, applies\nhis own expertise and decides on his own expert opinion. (Dina\nNath6). Where the clause, relating to settlement of disputes, contains\nwords which specifically exclude any of the attributes of an arbitration\nagreement or contains anything that detracts from an arbitration\nagreement, it will not be an arbitration agreement. (Jagdish\nChander2).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">31.   In Hudson&#x27;s Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th\nEdn., Vol. 1, in para 6.065, while drawing a distinction between a\ncertifier and an arbitrator in a building contract, it has been\nemphasised that, essentially, the certifier in a construction contract\nwill often be performing an administrative rather than a judicial\nfunction and, when doing so, there may often be no formulated\ndispute before him at all. He has been described as a &quot;preventer of\ndisputes&quot; in contra-distinction to an arbitrator whose function can\nonly arise once a dispute is in existence. He is not under the same\nobligation to afford the parties or their representatives a full hearing\nand receive evidence from them. Thus each contractual provision may\nneed to be carefully scrutinised to see into which category the person\nnamed falls.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">32.   It is also useful, in understanding whether the clause in the\nagreement constitutes a valid and binding arbitration agreement or a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                    19</span>\n\n\n\n\nprovision for expert determination, to refer to the judgments and texts\nrelied upon by learned counsel on either side.        Clause 22 of the\nagreement, in Tipper Chand13, read thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">         &#x27;Except where otherwise specified in the contract the\n      decision of the Superintending Engineer for the time being\n      shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties to the\n      contract upon all questions relating to the meaning of the\n      specifications,   design,     drawing      and     instructions\n      hereinbefore mentioned. The decision of such Engineer as to\n      the quality of workmanship, or materials used on the work,\n      or as to any other question, claim, right, matter or things\n      whatsoever, in any way arising out of or relating to the\n      contract, designs, drawing specifications, estimates,\n      instructions, orders, or these conditions, or otherwise\n      concerning the works, or the execution or failure to execute\n      the same, whether arising during the progress of the work,\n      or after the completion or abandonment of the contract by\n      the contractor, shall also be final, conclusive and binding on\n      the contractor.&#x27;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">33.   In interpreting this clause, a three Judge Bench of the Supreme\nCourt held that, admittedly, the clause did not contain any express\narbitration agreement, nor could such an agreement be spelt out from\nits terms by implication, there being no mention in it of any dispute,\nmuch less of a reference thereof; and on the other hand, the purpose of\nthe clause appeared to be to vest the Superintending Engineer with\nsupervision of the execution of the work, and administrative control\nover it, from time to time.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">34.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"287730\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/287730/\" id=\"a_24\">State of Maharashtra Vs.

In Bharat Bhushan Bansal14, the scope of two clauses of the\nagreement was in issue. They read as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      &quot;Decision of the Executive Engineer of the UPSIC to be final\n      on certain matters:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                   20</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">         Except where otherwise specified in the contract, the\n      decision of the Executive Engineer shall be final, conclusive\n      and binding on both the parties to the contract on all\n      questions relating to the meaning, the specification, design,\n      drawings and instructions hereinbefore mentioned, and as\n      to the quality of workmanship or materials used on the\n      work or as to any other question whatsoever in any way\n      arising out of or relating to the designs, drawings,\n      specifications, estimates, instructions, orders or otherwise\n      concerning the works or the execution or failure to execute\n      the same whether arising during the progress of the work,\n      or after the completion thereof or abandonment of the\n      contract by the contractor shall be final and conclusive and\n      binding on the contractor.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      Decision of the MD of the UPSIC on all other matters shall be\n      final\n         Except as provided in clause 23 hereof, the decision of\n      the Managing Director of the UPSIC shall be final,\n      conclusive and binding on both the parties to the contract\n      upon all questions relating to any claim, right, matter or\n      thing in any way arising out of or relating to the contract or\n      these conditions or concerning abandonment of the contract\n      by the contractor and in respect of all other matters arising\n      out of this contract and not specifically mentioned herein.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">36.   The Supreme Court held that these clauses did not spell out any\nintention to refer any disputes and differences between the parties to\narbitration; the clause did not contain an arbitration agreement either\nexpressly or by implication; the intention was to vest the Engineer\nwith supervision and administrative control over the work; the\nManaging Director was more in the category of an expert who would\ndecide claims, rights, or matters in any way pertaining to the contract;\nand the intention appeared more to avoid disputes than to decide\nformulated disputes in a quasi-judicial manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">37.   In Mallikarjun7, the Superintending Engineer, PWD, Gulbarga\nCircle was entrusted with the task of deciding the disputes.

On his competence to pass\nan award, the Supreme Court held that the Superintending Engineer,\nGulbarga Circle was an officer of the Public Works Department in the\nGovernment of Karnataka. He was not an officer of the University; he\ndid not have any authority or jurisdiction under the agreement or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                     21</span>\n\n\n\n\notherwise either to supervise the construction work or issue any\ndirection(s) to the contractor in relation to the contract job; he may be\nan ex-officio member of the Building Committee, but thereby, or by\nreason thereof, he could neither have been given, nor in fact had been\ngiven, the authority to supervise the contract job or for that matter\nissue any direction to the contractor as regards performance of the\ncontract; and the clause was an arbitration agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">38.      The question that arose for consideration in Dina Nath6 was\nwhether clause 4 of the Work Order No. 114 dated 16-5-1985 (in\nshort &quot;the Work Order&quot;) was an arbitration agreement. Clause 4 read\nthus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">         &quot;Any dispute arising between the department and the\n      contractor/society shall be referred to the Superintending\n      Engineer, Anandpur Sahib, Hydel Circle No. 1, Chandigarh\n      for orders and his decision will be final and acceptable/binding\n      on both the parties&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">39.      The Supreme Court held that a bare perusal of the definition of\nthe arbitration agreement [<a href=\"/doc/78032017/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 2(a)</a>] showed that an arbitration\nagreement was not required to be in any particular form; what was\nrequired to be ascertained was whether the parties had agreed that, if\nany dispute arises between them in respect of the subject-matter of the\ncontract, such dispute shall then be referred to arbitration; such an\nagreement would spell out an arbitration agreement (Refer:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">Rukmanibai Gupta12); to interpret the agreement as an &quot;arbitration\nagreement&quot; one had to ascertain the intention of the parties, and also\ntreatment of the decision as final; if the parties had desired and\nintended that a dispute must be referred to arbitration for decision, and\nthey undertook to abide by that decision, it must be held that the\nintention of the parties was to have an arbitration agreement, that is to\nsay, an arbitration agreement immediately came into existence; clause\n4 of the Work Order, between the parties, could be interpreted to be\nan arbitration agreement even though the term &quot;arbitration&quot; was not\nexpressly mentioned in the agreement; the test was of &quot;dispute&quot; and\n&quot;reference&quot;, and an arbitration agreement must contain broad\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                       22</span>\n\n\n\n\nconsensus between the parties that the disputes and differences should\nbe referred to a domestic tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">40.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1275754\" id=\"span_37\">In <a href=\"/doc/1275754/\" id=\"a_26\">Vishnu vs. State of Maharashtra17</a>, the relevant clauses of\nthe B-1 Agreement, entered into between the parties, read as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          &quot;All works to be executed under the contract shall be\n      executed under the direction and subject to the approval in all\n      respects of the Superintending Engineer of the Circle for the\n      time being, who shall be entitled to direct at what point or\n      points and in what manner they are to be commenced, and from\n      time to time carried on.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">          Except where otherwise specified in the contract and subject\n      to the powers delegated to him by the Government under the\n      Code Rules then in force the decision of the Superintending\n      Engineer of the Circle for the time being shall be final,\n      conclusive, and binding on all parties to the contract upon\n      all questions, relating to the meaning of the specifications,\n      designs, drawings, and instructions hereinbefore mentioned\n      and as to the quality of workmanship, or materials used on\n      the work, or as to any other question, claim, right, matter,\n      or thing whatsoever, if any way arising, out of, or relating to\n      the contract designs, drawings, specifications, estimates,\n      instructions, orders, or these conditions or otherwise\n      concerning the works, or the execution, or failure to execute\n      the same, whether arising, during the progress of the work,\n      or after the completion or abandonment thereof.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">41.   While examining the scope of these clauses, the Supreme Court\nheld that a conjoint reading of both the clauses of the B-1 Agreement,\nentered into between the parties, showed that the appellant had to\nexecute all works subject to the approval, in all respects, of the\nSuperintending Engineer of the Circle, who could issue directions\nfrom time to time about the manner in which the work was to\ncommence and be executed; by virtue of Clause 30, the decision of\nthe Superintending Engineer of the Circle was made final, conclusive\nand binding on all the parties in respect of all questions relating to the\nmeaning of the specifications, designs, drawings, quality of\nworkmanship or materials used on the work or any other question\nrelating to a claim, right, matter or thing arising out of or relating to\nthe contract designs, drawings, specifications, estimates, instructions,\norders, etc; these two clauses, by which the Superintending Engineer\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                     23</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas given overall supervisory control, were incorporated for smooth\nexecution of the works in accordance with the approved designs and\nspecifications, and also to ensure that the quality of the work was not\ncompromised; the power conferred upon the Superintending Engineer\nof the Circle was in the nature of a departmental dispute resolution\nmechanism, and was meant for expeditious sorting out of problems\nwhich could crop up during execution of the work; since the\nSuperintending Engineer was made overall in-charge of all works to\nbe executed under the contract, he was considered by the parties to be\nthe best person who could provide immediate resolution of any\ncontroversy relating to specifications, designs, drawings, quality of\nworkmanship or material used, etc; it was felt that, if all this was left\nto be decided by the regular civil courts, the object of expeditious\nexecution of the work of the project would be frustrated; this was the\nprimary reason why the Superintending Engineer of the Circle was\nentrusted with the task of taking decisions on various matters; and\nthere was nothing in the language of the clause from which it could be\ninferred that the parties had agreed to confer the role of an arbitrator\nupon the Superintending Engineer of the Circle.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">42.      In P. Dasaratharama Reddy Complex9, Clause 29(a) of the\nAgreement stipulated that:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">             &quot;any dispute or difference irrespective of its\n      nomenclature in matters relating to specifications, designs,\n      drawings, quality of workmanship or material used or any\n      question relating to claim, right in any way arising out of or\n      relating to the contract designs, drawings, etc. or failure on the\n      contractor&#x27;s part to execute the work, whether arising during\n      the progress of the work or after its completion, termination or\n      abandonment has to be first referred to the Chief Engineer or\n      the Designated Officer of the Department.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">43.      While interpreting this clause, the Supreme Court held that the\nChief Engineer or the Designated Officer was not an independent\nauthority or person, who had no connection or control over the work;\nas a matter of fact, he was having over all supervision and charge of\nthe execution of the work; he was not required to hear the parties or to\ntake evidence, oral or documentary. He was not invested with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                      24</span>\n\n\n\n\npower to adjudicate upon the rights of the parties to the dispute or\ndifference, and his decision was subject to the right of the aggrieved\nparty to seek relief in a court of law; the decision of the Chief\nEngineer or the Designated Officer was treated as binding on the\ncontractor subject to his right to avail his remedy before an\nappropriate court; the use of the expression &quot;in the first place&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">unmistakably showed that the non-adjudicatory decision of the Chief\nEngineer was subject to the right of the aggrieved party to seek\nremedy; and, therefore, the subject clause could not be treated as an\narbitration clause.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">44.      The relevant clauses, in Karnataka Power Transmission\nCorpn. Ltd4, read as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">         &quot;48.0 Settlement of disputes:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">         48.1 Any dispute(s) or difference(s) arising out of or in\n         connection with the contract shall, to the extent possible, be\n         settled amicably between the parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">         48.2 If any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever\n      shall arise between the owner and the contractor, arising out of\n      the contract for the performance of the works whether during\n      the progress of the works or after its completion or whether\n      before or after the termination, abandonment or breach of the\n      contract, it shall, in the first place, be referred to and settled by\n      the Engineer, who, within a period of thirty (30) days after\n      being requested by either party to do so, shall give written\n      notice of his decision to the owner and the contractor.\n         48.3 Save as hereinafter provided, such decision in respect\n      of every matter so referred shall be final and binding upon the\n      parties until the completion of the works and shall forthwith be\n      given effect to by the contractor who shall proceed with the\n      works with all the due diligence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">         48.4 During settlement of disputes and court proceedings,\n      both parties shall be obliged to carry out their respective\n      obligations under the contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">45.      While interpreting these clauses, the Supreme Court observed\nthat, on a careful reading thereof, it was demonstrable that it provided\nfor the parties to amicably settle any disputes or differences arising in\nconnection with the contract; this was the first part; the second part, as\nwas perceptible, was that when disputes or differences of any kind\narose between the parties to the contract, relating to the performance\nof the works, during the progress of the works or after its completion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                     25</span>\n\n\n\n\nor before or after termination, abandonment or breach of the contract,\nit was to be referred to and settled by the engineer who, on being\nrequested by either party, shall give notice of his decision within thirty\ndays to the owner and the contractor; there was also a stipulation that\nhis decision, in respect of every matter so referred to, shall be final\nand binding upon the parties until the completion of works, and was\nrequired to be given effect to by the contractor who should proceed\nwith the works with due diligence; to understand the intention of the\nparties, this part of the clause was important; on a studied scrutiny of\nthis postulate, it was clear that it did not provide any procedure which\nwould remotely indicate that the engineer concerned was required to\nact judicially as an adjudicator by following principles of natural\njustice or to consider the submissions of both the parties; that apart,\nthe decision of the engineer was only binding until the completion of\nthe works; it only cast a burden on the contractor who was required to\nproceed with the works with due diligence; besides the aforesaid,\nduring the settlement of disputes and the court proceedings, both the\nparties were obliged to carry out their obligation under the contract;\nthe said clause had been engrafted to avoid delay and stoppage of\nwork, and for the purpose of smooth carrying on of the works; the\nburden was on the contractor to carry out the works with due diligence\nafter getting the decision from the engineer until completion of the\nworks; emphasis was on the performance of the contract; the language\nemployed in the clause did not spell out the intention of the parties to\nget the disputes adjudicated through arbitration; and it did not really\nprovide for the resolution of disputes.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">46.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84190594\" id=\"span_41\">In <a href=\"/doc/84190594/\" id=\"a_27\">International     Amusement      Ltd.

The Supreme Court, following the law <a href=\"/doc/84190594/\" id=\"a_29\">laid down in</a> P.\nDasaratharama Reddy Complex9, held that Clause 28 in the\nagreement was not an arbitration clause; and appointment of an\narbitrator by the nominee of the Chief Justice has been rightly set\naside by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">48.      In para 18.067 of Vol. 2 of Hudson on Building and\nEngineering Contracts, Illustration (8) deals with a case where, by\nthe terms of a contract, it was provided that the engineer\n         &quot;shall be the exclusive judge upon all matters relating to the\n      construction, incidents and the consequences of these presents,\n      and of the tender, specifications, schedule and drawings of the\n      contract, and in regard to the execution of the works or\n      otherwise arising out of or in connection with the contract, and\n      also as regards all matters of account, including the final\n      balance payable to the contractor, and the certificate of the\n      engineer for the time being, given under his hand, shall be\n      binding and conclusive on both parties&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">49.      It was held that this clause was not an arbitration clause and\nthat the duties of the Engineer were administrative and not judicial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">50.      Just as in the present case where the Architect has been\nentrusted with the supervision of the work, a similar clause in Tipper\nChand13 was interpreted as vesting the Superintending Engineer with\nsupervision of the work and administrative control over it from time\nto time, and it was held that no arbitration agreement could be spelt\nout, from its terms, by implication. Similarly in Bharat Bhushan\nBansal14, where the Executive Engineer and the Managing Director of\nthe U.P. Small Industries Corporation were entrusted with certain\nfunctions under the agreement, the Supreme Court held that the\nintention was to vest the Engineer with the supervision and\nadministrative control of the work; the Managing Director was more\nin the category of an expert who would decide claims, rights, or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                       27</span>\n\n\n\n\nmatters in any way pertaining to the contract; and the intention\nappeared more to avoid disputes than to decide formulated disputes in\na quasi-judicial manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">51.   In Vishnu17, the Supreme Court held that the Superintending\nEngineer was given over-all supervisory control; the clauses were\nincorporated for smooth execution of the work, and to ensure that the\nquality of the work was not compromised; the power conferred on the\nSuperintending Engineer was in the nature of a departmental dispute\nresolution mechanism, and was meant for expeditious sorting out of\nproblems, which could crop-up during the execution of the work;\nsince the Superintending Engineer was made over-all in-charge, he\nwas considered by the parties to be the best person to provide\nimmediate resolution of any controversy relating to the work; and\nthere was nothing in the language of the clause, from which it could\nbe inferred that the parties had agreed to confer the role of an\narbitrator   upon   the       Superintending   Engineer.   Again   in   P.\nDasaratharama Reddy Complex9, the Supreme Court held that the\nChief Engineer was not an independent authority, or a person who had\nno connection or control over the work; he was having over-all\nsupervision and charge of the execution of the work; he was not\nrequired to hear partiers by taking evidence oral or documentary; and\nhe was not invested with the power to adjudicate upon the rights of\nthe parties to the dispute.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">52.   Just as in the present case, the relevant clause, in Karnataka\nPower Transmission Corpn4, was in two parts, and the Supreme\nCourt held that the said clauses did not provide any procedure, which\nrequired the Engineer to act judicially as an adjudicator by following\nprinciples of natural justice, or to consider submissions of both the\nparties; emphasis was on the performance of the contract; the\nlanguage employed in the clause did not spell out the intention of the\nparties to get the disputes adjudicated through arbitration; and it did\nnot provide for the resolution of disputes.     In all the aforesaid cases,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                    28</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe relevant clause was construed more as providing for expert\ndetermination, and not for arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">53.   The Superintending Engineer was held to be an arbitrator in\nMallikarjun7, since he was an officer of the Public Works\nDepartment, and was unconnected with the supervision of the\nconstruction work in the University (which was a party to the\narbitration agreement), nor could he issue any direction to the\ncontractor in relation to the construction work; and he was not given\nany authority to supervise the contract, or to regulate the parties of the\ncontract. It was because the Superintending Engineer was found not\nto be connected with the supervision of the work, was he held to be an\narbitrator. In the present case, various clauses of the agreement, as\nnoted hereinabove, clearly show that the Architect was involved at\ndifferent stages of the execution of the work, and was entrusted with\nthe task of supervision of the work. He is not a person unconnected\nwith the work and, in such circumstances, it is difficult to hold that the\nsubject clause is an arbitration agreement, and not of expert\ndetermination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">54.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_46\">In <a href=\"/doc/2073/\" id=\"a_30\">Indian Oil Corporation Limited and others vs. Raja\nTransport Private Ltd19</a>, on which reliance is placed on behalf of the\napplicant to contend that the architect plays a dual role, the Supreme\nCourt held that no party can say he will be bound by only one part of\nthe agreement, and not the other part, unless such other part is\nimpossible of performance, or is void being contrary to the provisions\nof the Act, or such part is severable from the remaining part of the\nagreement; the arbitration clause is a package which may provide for\nwhat disputes are arbitrable, at what stage the disputes are arbitrable,\nwho should be the arbitrator, what should be the venue, what law\nwould govern the parties etc; and a party to the contract cannot claim\nthe benefit of arbitration under the arbitration clause, but ignore the\nappointment procedure relating to the named Arbitrator contained in\nthe arbitration clause.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                    29</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_48\">55.   The law <a href=\"/doc/2073/\" id=\"a_31\">laid down in</a> Raja Transport Pvt. Ltd19 is that one\npart of the clause cannot be read out of context, ignoring the other\npart, unless the other part is impossible of performance. A harmonious\nreading of the clause below Clause 31, with the other relevant clauses\nof the contract (including Clause 14), makes it clear that the authority\ngiven to the Architect, to resolve disputes in connection with the\nexecution of the work, is as an expert and not as an Arbitrator. The\nmere fact that finality is given to the decisions of the Architect, in\nconnection with the work, does not make it an arbitration clause for\nthere are other clauses of the agreement which clearly define his role,\nin the supervision of the work under execution, in terms of the\nagreement.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">56.   Admittedly the subject clause does not contain an express\narbitration agreement. Nor can such an agreement be spelt out from its\nterms by implication, there being no mention in it of any reference of\nthe disputes. On the other hand, the purpose of the clause clearly\nappears to be to vest the Architect with supervision of the execution of\nthe work and administrative control over it from time to time.\n(Karnataka Power Transmission Corpn. Ltd4; Tipper Chand13).\nThe Architect has over all supervision and charge of the execution of\nthe work. He is not required to hear the parties or to take evidence,\noral or documentary. He is not invested with the power to adjudicate\nupon the rights of the parties to the dispute or difference. The decision\nof the Architect is treated as binding on the contractor. (P.\nDasaratharama Reddy Complex9). The subject clause does not\nrequire the architect to arrive at his decision on the evidence and\nsubmission of the parties. The said clause, evidently, requires the\narchitect to make on his own inquiry, and apply his own expertise in\ndeciding the question on his expert opinion. The said clause does not\nalso obligate the architect to afford both the parties a full hearing and\nreceive evidence from them. The Architect, who was made overall in-\ncharge of all works to be executed under the contract, was, evidently,\nconsidered by the parties to be the best person to provide immediate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                     30</span>\n\n\n\n\nresolution of any controversy relating to specifications, designs,\ndrawings, quality of workmanship or material used, etc. This is the\nprimary reason why the Architect was entrusted with the task of\ntaking decision on various matters. However, there is nothing in the\nlanguage of the clause from which it can be inferred that the parties\nhad agreed to confer the role of arbitrator upon the Architect.\n(Vishnu17).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">III. IS THE CLAIM OF THE APPLICANT, OF THE\nAGREEMENT CONTAINING AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE,\nAN AFTER-THOUGHT?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">57.   Mr. Arvind Vashisth, learned Senior Counsel for the applicant,\nwould submit that it is a clear mandate of the law that the parties may\nchoose any person, to act as an arbitrator, with mutual consent; the\nRespondent has admitted, in its counter-affidavit, that the work was\ncompleted in late 2014; they had, however, stated the date of\ncompletion of the work, in its reply to the Notice (Ann. 10), as June\n2013; there is no dispute about limitation, since the final Bill as well\nas the notice, for invoking Arbitration, was issued within three years\nfrom the admitted date of completion of the Works; the contention of\nthe respondent regarding the named Arbitrator (Architect) being\ninvolved in the agreement, their apprehension of his being biased, is\nunfounded; it is the respondent which has appointed the Architect,\nwhich was agreed upon by the Applicant, to decide the disputes; bias\nwill not arise in cases where the parties have agreed upon the named\narbitrator; in case the Court is of the view that there is a possibility of\nbias, it may appoint an independent arbitrator; the objection raised by\nthe respondent is, therefore, not valid; further the amendment in\n<a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 12 (5)</a> of the Act, in the year 2015, has taken away the\nelement of bias, as well as the fact that the named authority may not\nact as an Arbitrator if he is connected with the Contract or the parties\nthereto, with the exception that the parties are free to waive the\nrequirement of independence; the respondent cannot, therefore, be\nallowed to approbate and reprobate at their own convenience; and a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                    31</span>\n\n\n\n\nmere allegation of bias will not render the Arbitration Agreement a\nnullity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">58.    On the other hand Mr. T.S. Bindra, learned counsel for the\nrespondent, would submit that the plea of Arbitration is an after-\nthought as is evident from the applicant&#x27;s letter dated 04.05.2016; the\nArchitect had given his decisions earlier, but as an expert and not as a\nJudge; the Supreme Court, in Shyam Sunder Agarwal15, has held\nthat the future conduct of the parties is also relevant; the e-mails dated\n1/3/2016 and 26/3/2016 are relevant; the work was awarded on\n10/8/11, and the date of completion of the work was 9/8/12; while the\napplicant claims to have completed the work in the latter part of the\nyear 2014; the work was, in fact, completed virtually on 1/4/13, and\nonly minor rectification works were carried on till May 2013; Clause\nNo. 14 of the agreement requires the final bill to be submitted by the\ncontractor within one week of virtual completion of the work, and no\nfurther claims shall be made by the contractor after submission of the\nfinal bill, and for these claims to be deemed to have been waived and\nextinguished; the requests, of the applicant for payment, were also\nforwarded to the architect in the year 2016; the cause of action can be\nsaid to have arisen either in May, 2013 or in the year 2014 when the\nwork was admittedly completed even as per the version of the\napplicant; accordingly, the alleged cause of action, if any, had arisen\nprior to the enforcement of the 2015 amendment to the 1996 Act; it is\napparent, from the sequence of events, that the alleged final bill was\nraised malafide, and as an after-thought; the plea, of an Arbitration\nClause, has been taken with a pre-planned strategy after the 1996 Act\nwas amended; even if it is assumed, without admitting, that\nhypothetically the Architect was an Arbitrator, the Applicant can then\nbe said to have already sent / referred the matter to the Architect; and\nhe cannot now challenge his jurisdiction by invoking the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 12</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">59.    The 1996 Act was amended by Act No. 03 of 2016 with\nretrospective effect from 23.10.2015 and Clause 5 was inserted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                       32</span>\n\n\n\n\nwhereby, notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any\nperson, whose relationship with the parties or the counsel or the\nsubject matter of the dispute falls in any of the categories mentioned\nin the Seventh Schedule, shall be ineligible to be appointed as an\nArbitrator. Under the proviso thereto the parties may, subsequent to\nthe disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of\nthis sub-section by an express agreement in writing. The Seventh\nSchedule gives instances of an arbitrator&#x27;s relationship with the\nparties or the counsel which would render him ineligible to be\nappointed as an Arbitrator. Entry 1 is where an Arbitrator is an\nemployee, consultant, advisor or has any other past or present\nbusiness relationship with a party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">60.   In the present case, the so called arbitration clause (the clause\nafter Clause 31) refers to the Architect who, in terms of Entry 1 of the\nSeventh Schedule read with <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act, is ineligible to\nbe appointed as an Arbitrator. While it is no doubt true that, under the\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act, this embargo can be waived by a\nspecific agreement in writing between the parties, it is evident from\nthe legal notice dated 04.05.2016, issued by the applicant to the\nrespondent, (details of which shall be referred to hereinafter), that the\napplicant had made it clear that it was impermissible for the Architect\nto be appointed as an Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">61.   Act No. 03 of 2016 was notified in the Gazette of India on\n01.01.2016.    The very fact that the applicant raised a final bill\nthereafter, and had subsequently sought reference to arbitration, lends\ncredence to the submission, urged on behalf of the respondent by Mr.\nT.S. Bindra, learned counsel, that it is only after the amendment, by\nAct No. 03 of 2016, that this ruse was adopted by the applicant to\nsomehow have the disputes between the parties referred to\nArbitration, (even in the absence of an Arbitration agreement between\nthe parties), while at the same time avoid arbitration by the Architect.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                      33</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">62.      An arbitration agreement must contain the broad consensus\nbetween the parties that the disputes and differences should be\nreferred to a domestic tribunal. The said domestic tribunal must be an\nimpartial one. A person cannot be a judge of his own cause as justice\nshould not only be done but must be manifestly seen to be done.\n(Bihar State Mineral Development Corpn5). In Raja Transport\n(P) Ltd19, the Supreme Court held that, where the named arbitrator, a\nsenior     officer   of   the   Government/statutory   body/government\ncompany, had nothing to do with the execution of the subject contract,\nthere can be no justification for anyone doubting his independence or\nimpartiality, in the absence of any specific evidence. Even before the\n1996 Act was amended by Act No. 3 of 2016 w.e.f. 23.10.2015, while\na named arbitrator unconnected with the work could be appointed as\nthe arbitrator, a person connected with the work could not, since the\nsaid person would not be perceived as being impartial. It is difficult\nfor us, therefore, to accept the submission, urged on behalf of the\napplicant, that, notwithstanding the deep involvement of the Architect\nin the execution of the work, both the parties intended that he resolve\nthe disputes, arising under the contract, as an independent arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">63.      The applicant sent an e-mail on 01.03.2016 to the respondent,\nmarking a copy thereof to the Architect, informing that they had\nsubmitted their final bill of the work of construction of the building on\n03.02.2016; and payment against the same be released at the earliest.\nAgain, by letter dated 26.03.2016, the applicant informed the\nrespondent, marking a copy of the said letter to the Architect, that six\nweeks had elapsed from the date, the copy of the final bill dated\n03.02.2016 had been served; a reminder was also sent on 01.03.2016;\nand they had not received payment. While requesting the respondent\nto process the payment, the applicant informed them that they would\nbe constrained to initiate legal proceedings if payment was not made.\nWhat is of relevance, in these two e-mails, is that copies thereof were\nmarked to the Architect also.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                    34</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_71\">64.   In the legal notice, issued on behalf of the applicant on\n04.05.2016, it is stated that, though the work was completed and\nhanded over, the entire payment were not received, and a final bill\ndated 02.02.2016 for Rs. 5,95,29,514/- was sent to the respondent by\nemail dated 03.02.2016; despite receiving the said final bill, no\npayment had been made against the applicant&#x27;s claim; reminders were\nsent on 01.03.2016 and 12.04.2016 despite which payment of the final\nbill was not made; as per the terms of the agreement, the disputes\nwere to be resolved by way of arbitration with a named Arbitrator in\nthe agreement; however due to the 1996 Act, as amended by the 2015\nAmendment Act, the named Arbitrator in the agreement could not\nfunction as an Arbitrator; the applicant does not consent to his\nappointment as an Arbitrator; and in terms of Clause 32 of the\nagreement dated 22.01.2011, they had nominated an Arbitrator to\nresolve the matter by arbitration, and as an Arbitrator to adjudicate the\ndisputes that had arisen inter se. The respondent was called upon to\npay Rs. 5,60,28,472/- along with interest at 18% p.a. from the date of\nthe final bill till its payment, or on failure thereof, to consent to the\nname of the person they proposed to act as an Arbitrator to adjudicate\nthe dispute between the parties within 30 days of receipt of the notice.\nThe respondent was informed that, in case of their failure to consent\nfor appointment of an Arbitrator under the agreement, the applicant\nwould approach the Court for appointment of an Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_72\">65.   In reply thereto, a legal notice dated 24.05.2016 was sent on\nbehalf of the respondent stating that, prior to the notice dated\n04.05.2016, no letter of demand was ever made by the applicant; it\nwas apparent on the face of the record that the so called claims of the\napplicant was stale and hopelessly barred by time; it was purely a\nresult of an after-thought; there was no arbitration clause in the\nagreement executed between the respondent and the applicant; the\nclause, after Clause 31, could not be construed as an arbitration\nclause; in any eventuality, the applicant should have raised the dispute\nbefore the architect, who was the architect during execution of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                   35</span>\n\n\n\n\nworks; no amount was payable by the respondent to the applicant;\nand, on the contrary, it was the respondent who had sustained losses\non account of defects and delay in the execution of the works.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">66.   In Shyam Sunder Agarwal15, the clause which the applicant\nclaimed was the arbitration agreement read as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      &quot;It is further agreed that any decision to be taken by the said\n      Mediators/Arbitrators during the period of entire transaction in\n      the event of any breach committed by either of the parties shall\n      be final and binding on all the parties hereinabove.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">67.   While construing this clause, the Supreme Court observed that\nthe very fact that the clause referred to &quot;Mediators/Arbitrators&quot; would\nshow that the language used was loose; the idea really was that the\ntwo named persons did all things necessary, during implementation of\nthe transaction between the parties, to ensure that the transaction is\nsuccessfully completed; this clause should be read in the light of the\nother clauses of the agreement; the expression &#x27;decision&#x27; in Clause-12\nwas only a pro-term decision i.e. the decision was taken only during\nthe period of transaction, and not thereafter; they were &quot;functus\nofficio&quot; after the transactions were completed; and a reading of the\nagreement as a whole left no manner of doubt that it only invested the\ntwo gentlemen named therein with powers to smoothly implement the\ntransaction mentioned in the MOU, and not even remotely to decide\nthe disputes between the parties as Arbitrators; the wording of the\nagreement was clearly inconsistent with the view that the agreement\nintended the dispute to be decided by arbitration; a clause in an\nAgreement, inserted for the purpose of prevention of a dispute, would\nnot be an arbitration agreement; the idea, in the present case, was to\nprevent   disputes   from    occurring,   and    to    ensure    smooth\nimplementation of the agreement; and the object was not to adjudicate\ndisputes, but to prevent them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">68.   The Supreme Court, in Shyam Sunder Agarwal15, also\nexamined the conduct of the applicant, and observed that his conduct\nleft much to be desired; there was no reason why the <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 11</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                    <a href=\"/doc/1282684/\" id=\"a_37\">36</a></span>\n\n\n\n\nApplication was delayed for a period of two and a half years, after a\nnotice was issued for arbitration; and his conduct, even during the\npendency of the <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 11</a> petition, also left much to be desired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\">69.   The contention that the respondent had admitted in the counter\naffidavit, that the work was completed only in late 2014, is not\ntenable. On the contrary, the respondent has categorically denied that\nthe work was finally completed in late 2014 (refer paragraph no. 10 of\nthe counter affidavit). While the question of limitation cannot be\nexamined, in an application filed under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 11</a>, in view of the\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 11</a>(6-A) which requires the Court to confine its\nexamination only to the existence of an arbitration agreement, the fact\nremains that it is only after Act 3 of 2016 came into force, and a\nperson involved in the execution of the work was disabled by\nlegislation from acting as the arbitrator, did the applicant claim that\nthe clause below clause 31 of the agreement was an arbitration clause\nfor, if they had sought arbitration earlier, they ran the risk of the\nmatter being resolved by the architect himself. The bonafides of the\napplicant is suspect. It is unnecessary for us, however, to dwell on this\naspect any further as we have already held that the clause below\nclause 31 provides only for expert determination, and there is no\narbitration agreement between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">IV. CONCLUSION:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">70.   In the absence of an arbitration agreement the present\napplications, seeking appointment of an arbitrator, must fail. The\napplications are, accordingly, dismissed. No costs.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">                                        (Ramesh Ranganathan, C.
