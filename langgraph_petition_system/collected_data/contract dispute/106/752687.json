Even it a party insists on a particular\nform  that would not affect the contract, though it  may  in\ncertain\t   circumstances   disentitle\thim   to    specific\nperformance.\nBindeshri  Prasad v. Mahant Jairam Gir (I.L.R. 9  All.\t705)\nreferred to.\n In a suit instituted by a purchaser against the vendor and\na  subsequent  purchaser  for specific\tperformance  of\t the\ncontract of sale, if the plaintiff succeeds, the proper form\nof the decree to be passed is to direct specific performance\nof  the\t contract between the vendor and the  plaintiff\t and\ndirect\tthe subsequent transferee to join in the  conveyance\nso  as\tto  pass on the title which resides in\thim  to\t the\nplaintiff.

There may be  equities  between\nthe  vendor and the subsequent transferee which\t would\tmake\nthat improper, and unless these are also raised and  decided\nin  the case, the normal rule should be to direct the  money\nto be paid to the vendor.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">CIVIL\t  APPELLATE\tJURISDICTION Civil     Appeal No. 86\nof 1950.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">361</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">Appeal\tfrom  the Judgment and Decree, dated the  12th\tMay,\n1949,  of the High Court of judicature at  Allahabad  (Seth,\nAgarwal\t and Wanchoo JJ.) in First Appeal No. 410  of  1943,\narising\t out  of  the judgment and Decree,  dated  the\t28th\nApril, 1943, of the Court of the first Civil judge of Meerut\nin Original Suit No. 4 ,of 1942.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">   S.

P. The  plaintiff\nis  the\t vendee\t and the second and  third  defendants,\t who\nappeal, are subsequent purchasers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">The only question which we are asked to decide here,  except\nfor certain subsidiary matters, is whether the agreement  of\n7th  February, 1942, was a concluded one.   The\t plaintiff&#x27;s\ncase  is  that\ton that date the Nawab agreed  to  sell\t the\nplaint\tproperty  to  him for Rs. 62,000  and  accepted\t Rs.\n10,000 as earnest money the same day.  Later, namely on\t 4th\nApril,\t1942,  the  Nawab  sold the  same  property  to\t the\nappellants  for a sum of Rs. 72,000.  The  plaintiff  states\nthat the appellants had notice of his prior agreement.\nThe  appellant&#x27;s  case\tis that the  plaintiff&#x27;s  so  called\nagreement of 7th February, 1942, was not a concluded one  as\nthe parties never reached finality.  They raised a number of\nother  defences\t such  as misrepresentation  and  fraud,  an\nagreement  with the Nawab prior to that ,of  the  plaintiff,\nlack of knowledge of the plaintiff&#x27;s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">362</span>\nagreement  and\tso  forth.  But\t all  those  positions\twere\nabandoned  in  this court and the only point  argued,  aside\nfrom certain subsidiary ones with which we shall deal later,\nwas  whether the parties reached finality on  7th  February,\n1942.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">The  learned  trial judge held, among  other  things,,\tthat\nthere was no concluded contract and so dismissed the.  suit.\nIn the High Court the appellate Bench which heard the appeal\ndiffered.   Harish Chandra J. held that the parties  reached\nfinality  while Kaul J. differing from him agreed  with\t the\ntrial  court  and  held\t they  had  not.   The\tmatter\t was\naccordingly referred to, a Full Bench of three Judges.\t All\nthree held that there was a concluded contract.\t In view  of\nthis,  the appeal was allowed and the plaintiff&#x27;s  suit\t was\ndecreed\t on condition that the plaintiff deposit Rs.  62,000\nin  court.  This he did.  Defendants Nos. 2 and 3, who,\t are\nsubsequent purchasers, appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">The plaintiff and the appellants were prepared to compromise\nin  this  court on terms that the plaintiff should  get\t the\nproperty and the apllants be paid Rs.  62,000 to  compensate\nthem  for the Rs.. 58,000 which they said they had  paid  to\nthe Nawab for their subsequent purchase and for the loss  of\nthe  property. (The plaintiff said the appellants  paid\t the\nNawab, Rs. 72,000 and not Rs. 58,000 but there is no finding\nabout  this).\tAs  the Nawab&#x27;s estate\thas  vested  in\t the\nCustodian,  U. P., we thought it proper to join him in\tthis\nappeal in case he should later lay claim to the\t plaintiff&#x27;s\nRs.  62,000.   The  fears  of  the  parties  regarding\t the\nCustodian,  U.\tP.,  were  justified,  for  he\trefused\t  to\ncompromise and claimed the Rs. 62,000 despite the fact\tthat\nthe  Nawab  had already been paid Rs. 58,000.\tHis  learned\ncounsel\t stated\t that  it  was for  him\t to  decide  whether\nanything  had been paid to the Nawab and if so how much\t and\nfor  him to decide what should be done with the Rs.  62,000.\nIn  view  of that we have been obliged to proceed  with\t the\nappeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">The  differing\topinions of the various learned\t judges\t who\nhave  handled  this case show that the\tevidence  is  nicely\nbalanced.   The\t question  of  burden  accordingly   assumes\nimportance, as also another guide\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">363</span>\nwhich  Judges of experience have applied through the  years.\nWhen  the question is one of fact and is of a simple  nature\nIt  is useful to collect facts which are admitted or  proved\nbeyond\tdoubt  and then see which case fits  in\t with  those\nfacts.\tThey are useful as pointers to show the way.\nNow the question here is one of fact.  The plaintiff  founds\non a contract which the defendants deny.  He must  therefore\nprove  it.  The initial burden is on him.  He relies on\t two\nfacts in the plaint.  The first is that he paid a sum of Rs.\n10,000\tto the Nawab on 7th February, 1942, by two  cheques.\nThe Nawab accepted this money and cashed the cheques and the\nmoney went into his own account in his bank.  The second  is\nthat the Nawab gave the plaintiff a receipt on that date for\nthis money.  These two facts are admitted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">     The receipt (Ex. 35-G) is signed by the Nawab and is in\nthese terms :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">    &quot;Received  this  7th  of February, 1942, a\tsum  of\t Rs.\n10,000\tby two cheques. as earnest money out of\t Rs.  62,000\nfor  the contract of sale [of the plaint  property]  through\nBabu Chhater Sen and executed a receipt. 7th February, 1942.\nIt is further declared that the sale deed would be  executed\nwithin\tthree months and that in default the contract  would\nbe deemed cancelled.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">This  is the language of a completed contract and  if  there\nwas  nothing more the plaintiff would succeed.\t The  burden\ntherefore   shifts  because  of\t the   Nawab&#x27;s\t unqualified\nadmission in this document.  We must accordingly turn to the\ndefendants&#x27;  pleadings and their, evidence to see  how\tthis\nburden is discharged.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">The   Nawab&#x27;s  plea  in\t the  main  is\tone  of\t fraud\t and\nmisrepresentation.   In his written statement he  says\tthat\nthere  was a previous contract with the appellants  for\t Rs.\n58,000 and that they paid him Rs. 6,000 as earnest money  on\n5th  February,\t1942.  After this,  the\t plaintiff&#x27;s  broker\nChatter Sen told him (the Nawab) falsely that the appellants\nhad  backed out and that in view of this it would  pay\tthe.\nNawab  to accept the plaintiff&#x27;s offer of Rs.  62,000.\t The\nNawab believing this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">364</span>\nto be true entered into the contract of 7th February,  1942,\nwith the plaintiff and accepted Rs. 10,000 as earnest money.\nHe concludes\n&quot;The  talk, on the plaintiff&#x27;s behalf, about payment of\t the\nearnest\t money\tconducted through Chattar Sen,\tbroker,\t was\nwholly\tbased  on  fraud  and deception and  so\t it  is\t not\nbinding.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">Stopping there.\t There is implicit in this plea of fraud and\nmisrepresentation  an averment that the contract  was  valid\nand  binding till set aside at the option of the  Nawab\t who\nwas the defrauded party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">      The  only\t other plea relevant to this matter  is\t the\nfollowing :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">    &quot;All  the  conditions  of the sale\tcan  under  no\tcir-\ncumstance be taken as fulfilled and deemed as fait  accompli\nbetween the plaintiff and the answering defendant ; and, for\nthis reason also, the talk between them about the moabeda is\nnot enforceable&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">    This is as vague as it can be and is the kind of  woolly\npleading which a party who is not sure of his facts and case\nusually makes; no particulars are furnished.  But apart from\nthat, here again the motif of the theme is that there was  a\nconcluded contract which fell to the ground because  certain\nconditions,   presumably  conditions  precedent,  were\t not\nfulfilled.   In any case, this does not explain the  receipt\nand  the  circumstances in which it came to be\tgiven  apart\nfrom  the  explanation\twhich is contained in  the  plea  of\nfraud.\t But  that, as we have said, imports  the  important\naverment that there as a concluded contract which bound both\nsides until it was set aside at the option of the  defrauded\nparty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">   The\tappellants&#x27;  pleas follow the same pattern.   It  is\ntrue  that in paragraph 26 of their written  statement\tthey\nstart  by saying that &quot;No agreement was entered into  etc...\nbut  they explain that by saying that &quot;whatever\t proceedings\nwere  taken  concerning the  plaintiff&#x27;s  moabeda.....\twere\ntaken\tby  defrauding\tand  misrepresenting   etc....\t and\nconsequently the moabeda relied on by the plaintiffis\nlegally invalid.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">365</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">The  same theme of fraud and misrepresentation\tis  ,carried\nthrough to paragraphs 27 and 28.  There is no clear cut plea\nthat  there was never at any time a concluded agreement\t and\nthere  is  no attempt to explain away the  receipt,  Exhibit\n35G,  or  to show the circumstances in which it came  to  be\nmade.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">The  issues  reflect these pleadings and no  issue  asks  in\nclear  cut terms whether the parties had  reached  finality,\nnor  is\t the  burden  anywhere laid on\tthe  Nawab  and\t the\nappellants to explain away the receipt, Exhibit 35-G.\n[Their Lordships then reviewed the evidence.]\nA question was also raised about the plaintiff. demanding  a\nwarranty  of  title and the Nawab refusing.   But  this\t had\nnothing to do with the bargain struck on 7th February, 1942.\nThe  question of warranty arose in this way.  When the\tsale\ndeed  was  in  the course of preparation,  in  March,  1942,\nChattar Sen brought a draft containing a warranty in a\tform\nto which the Nawab&#x27;s manager objected because the  plaintiff\nwas  insisting\ton it; but there the matter  ended.   It  is\nusual  to insert a warranty of title in most sale deeds\t and\nwhen that is not done the law imports one; and in some deeds\nthere  is a covenant for quiet enjoyment as well.  All\tthat\nhappened  here\twas that the kind of  warranty\tinserted  by\nChattar\t Sen  in the draft was not acceptable to  the  other\nside.\tBut nobody suggested either in the evidence  or\t the\npleadings  that the plaintiff refused to accept a sale\tdeed\nunless\tthe exact form of warranty placed in the  draft\t was\ngiven.\t As we have said, this question arose subsequent  to\nthe contract for sale and the plaintiff&#x27;s insistence on this\nform of warranty at that stage could not affect the contract\nof 7th February, 1942.\tIt might in a given case  disentitle\nhim to specific performance as it did in Bindeshri Prasad v.\nMahant\tJairam Gir(1).\tBut that would depend  upon  whether\nhis  proposal regarding a form of warranty to which  he\t was\nnot  entitled was a mere proposal regarding the form of\t the\nsale  deed  or\twas a refusal to  perform  without  it.\t  No\nquestion of repudiation or refusal to perform was raised  in\nthe pleadings nor is\n(1)  I.L.R. 9 All. 705.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">366</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">that  to  be found in the evidence.  On\t the  contrary,\t the\nplaintiff&#x27;s  letter,  dated 22nd April, 1942, Ex.  25  calls\nupon  the Nawab to complete the conveyance &quot;as\tagreed\tto&quot;;\nand the plaint is to the same effect; it says nothing  about\na  warranty.   In  the\tcircumstances,\ta  dispute   arising\nsubsequent  to\tthe  contract for salt\tabout  a  particular\nclause\tin the deed during the negotiations about  the\tform\nthe  deed should take cannot affect the completeness of\t the\ncontract already made, nor can it amount to repudiation when\nit is not persisted in and the plaintiff later expresses his\nreadiness  and willingness to perform the  contract  &quot;agreed\nto&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">It  was\t also argued that there was  no\t concluded  contract\nbecause\t the  only parties who were  competent\tto  contract\nnever  met.   On the 7th Chatter Sen met the Nawab  and\t the\ndefendants&#x27;  learned counsel argued that Chattar Sen had  no\nauthority to contract on behalf of the plaintiff.  The later\nmeeting\t was between the plaintiff and the  Nawab&#x27;s  manager\nand  it\t was  saidt that the manager  had  no  authority  to\nconclude the bargain.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">There  is  nothing in this point.  The plaint  states  quite\ndefinitely that Chattar Sen was sent by the. plaintiff\twith\nRs. 10,000 earnest money and relies on the contract effected\nby  him.   Chattar  Sens  authority  to\t contract  was\t not\nquestioned.  We cannot allow it to be questioned here.\tThat\nmeans that there was an effective and concluded contract  on\nthe 7th between Chattar Sen, on the plaintiff&#x27;s behalf,\t and\nthe  Nawab direct, both of whom were competent to seal\tthe.\nbargain.   The\tquestion  whether  the\tNawab&#x27;s\t  managerhad\nauthority to complete the contract on the Nawab&#x27;s beha\twhen\nhe met the plaintiff after this does not arise, for on\tthat\ndate there was already a binding contract in existence.\nDisagreeing  with  the trial court, and\t agreeing  with\t the\nmajority of the judges in the High Court, we hold that there\nwas  a completed contract on 7th February, 1942,  which\t the\nplaintiff is entitled to have specifically, performed.\nNow  arises  a question which touches the  Custodian,  Uttar\nPradesh.  The contract was for&#x27; Rs. 62,000.  The:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">367</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">plaintiff  paid\t Rs. 10,000 as earnest money  but  this\t was\nlater returned, so Rs. 62,000 is still due.  But there is  a\nconveyance outstanding in favour of the appellants for which\nthey have paid, according to their case, Rs. 58,000.  If the\nRs.  62,000  due  to the Nawab is paid to  him,\t or  to\t the\nCustodian,  U. P., who represents his estate, it is  evident\nthat the Nawab, who is at fault, will be paid twice over for\nthe  same property and his estate will\tbenefit\t accordingly\nwhile  the appellants will be left to pursue their  remedies\nagainst the Nawab or his estate.  The question is whether we\nhave  power  to direct that the Rs. 58,000 be  paid  to\t the\nappellants.  instead  of  to  the  Nawab  and  thus  obviate\nfurther,  and possibly fruitless litigation.  But before  we\ndecide\tthat,  we will consider another\t question  which  is\nbound up with it, namely, the proper form of decree in\tsuch\ncases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">The practice of the courts in India has not been uniform and\nthree  distinct lines of thought emerge. (We are  of  course\nconfining  our attention to a Purchaser&#x27;s suit for  specific\nperformance).\tAccording to one point of view,\t the  proper\nform of decree is to declare the subsequent purchase void as\nagainst\t the plaintiff and direct conveyance by\t the  vendor\nalone.\t A  second  considers that both\t vendor\t and  vendee\nshould\tjoin,  while a third would limit  execution  of\t the\nconveyance to the subsequent purchaser.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">The  only statutory provisions which bear on this point\t are\n<a href=\"/doc/67340/\" id=\"a_1\">section 91</a> of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, section 3 of\t the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1877, illustration (g), and <a href=\"/doc/1633332/\" id=\"a_2\">section  27</a>\nof that Act, and <a href=\"/doc/552060/\" id=\"a_3\">section 40</a> of the Transfer of Property Act.\n<a href=\"/doc/67340/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\t 91</a> of the Trusts Act, does not make the  subsequent\npurchaser  with\t notice\t a trustee properly  so\t called\t but\nsaddles\t him  with an obligation in the nature\tof  a  trust\n(because  of <a href=\"/doc/636650/\" id=\"a_5\">section 80</a>) and directs that he must  hold\t the\nproperty  for the benefit of the prior &quot;contractor&quot;,  if  we\nmay so describe the plaintiff,.\t &quot;to the extent necessary to\ngive effect to the contract.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"><a href=\"/doc/1839587/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3</a> illustration (g) of the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_7\">Specific Relief Act</a>  makes\nhim a trustee for the plaintiff but only for &#x27;the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">368</span>\npurposes  of  that  Act.   <a href=\"/doc/552060/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 40</a>  of  the\tTransfer  of\nProperty  Act  enacts that this obligation can\tbe  enforced\nagainst a subsequent transferee with notice but not  against\none who holds for consideration and without notice.  <a href=\"/doc/357591/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n27</a> of the Specific Relief Act does not carry the matter\t any\nfurther.

It will  there-\nfore be necessary to analyse each form in the light of other\nprovisions of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"833792\" id=\"span_9\">First,  we\t reach the position that the  title  to\t the\nproperty  has validly passed from the vendor and resides  in\nthe subsequent transferee.  The sale to him is not void\t but\nonly voidable at the option of the earlier &quot;contractor&quot;.  As\nthe  title  no\tlonger\trests in  the  vendor  it  would  be\nillogical from a conveyancing point of view to compel him to\nconvey\tto the plaintiff unless steps are taken\t to  re-vest\nthe  title in him either by cancellation of  the  subsequent\nsale  or  by reconveyance from the subsequent  purchaser  to\nhim.  We do not know of any case in which a reconveyance. to\nthe  vendor  was ordered but Sulaiman C. adopted  the  other\ncourse\tin  <a href=\"/doc/833792/\" id=\"a_10\">Kali  Charan  v.  Janak  Deo</a>(1).   He   directed\ncancellation  of the subsequent sale and conveyance  to\t the\nplaintiff by the vendor in accordance with the. contract  of\nsale  of which the plaintiff sought. :specific\tperformance.\nBut  though this sounds logical the objection to it is\tthat\nit might bring in its train complications between the vendor\nand the subsequent purchaser.  There may be covenants in the\ndeed  between them which it would be inequitable to  disturb\nby cancellation of their deed.\tAccordingly, we do not think\nthat is a desirable solution.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">(1)  A.I.R. 1932 All. 694.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">369</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">We are not enamoured of the next alternative either, namely,\nconveyance   by\t the  subsequent  purchaser  alone  to\t the\nplaintiff.  It is true that would have the effect of vesting\nthe  title to the property in the plaintiff but it might  be\ninequitable  to\t compel the subsequent transferee  to  enter\ninto terms and covenants in the vendor&#x27;s agreement with\t the\nplaintiff to which he would never have agreed had he been  a\nfree  agent;  and  if the original  contract  is  varied  by\naltering  or omitting such terms the court will be  remaking\nthe contract, a thing it has no power to do; and in any case\nit  will  no longer be specifically enforcing  the  original\ncontract but another and different one.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">In  our\t opinion,  the proper form of decree  is  to  direct\nspecific performance of the contract between the vendor\t and\nthe  plaintiff and direct the subsequent transferee to\tjoin\nin  the conveyance so as to pass on the title which  resides\nin  him to the plaintiff.  He does not join in\tany  special\ncovenants made between the plaintiff and his vendor; all  he\ndoes is to pass on his title to the plaintiff.\tThis was the\ncourse\tfollowed by the Calcutta High Courtin Kafiladdin  v.\nSamiraddin (I), and appears to be the English practice.\t See\nFry on Specific Performance, 6th edition, page 90, Paragraph\n207 ; also Potter v. Sanders( 2 ). We direct accordingly.\nThat brings us to the question of the Rs. 62,000.  We do not\nthink  it would be right to lay down that in every case\t the\nbalance\t of  the  purchase  money  should  be  paid  to\t the\nsubsequent transferee up to the extent of the  consideration\npaid  by him.  There may be equities between the vendor\t and\nthe  subsequent transferee which would make  that  improper,\nso,   unlessthey   fight  the  question\t  out\tas   between\nthemselvesand  it  is decided as an issue in the  case,\t the\nnormalrule  should be to require that the money be  paid  to\nthe  vendor.  But the circumstances here are peculiar.\t The\nparties\t before us were prepared to compromise, and had\t the\nNawab been here it is more than probable that he would\thave\nbeen  glad to agree so as to avoid further litigation.\t But\nhe is in Pakistan and is.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">(1) A.

This is an equitable relief and we\thave\na  wide\t discretion.   We joined the Custodian,\t U.  P.,  to\nafford him the opportunity of showing why we should not take\nwhat  appears to be the just and equitable course.  We\thave\nafforded  him an opportunity of showing how the Nawab  could\nhave  defended\ta suit by the appellants for refund  of\t the\nconsideration.\tAs he has not been able to show us  anything\nin the contract between the Nawab and the appellants, or  in\nthe  covenants\tof their deed, which  would  disentitle\t the\nappellants  from  claiming  Rs. 58,000 from  the  Nawab,  we\nconsider it right that Rs. 58,000 should be paid to them and\nRs. 4,000 to the Custodian, U. P. All that the Custodian, U.\nP., was able to urge was that the whole amount had vested in\nhim and so was his.  But that is not so.  The plaintiff\t was\ndirected  to  pay  a  sum of Rs.  62,000  into\tcourt  as  a\ncondition  precedent to the execution of a sale deed in\t his\nfavour.\t  Curiously enough, the decree does not say what  is\nto  be done with the money when it is paid into court.\t But\nso  long  as it is in court under those conditions  it\tlies\nthere subject to such decree as may ultimately be passed  in\nappeal.\t  We therefore have full power to direct payment  of\nRs.  58,000  to\t the appellants instead\t of  to\t the  Nawab,\nespecially as there is this lacuna in the decree.\nThe High Court&#x27;s decree will now be modified as follows :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       (1)     The Nawab will be directed to execute a\tsale\ndeed in the plaintiff&#x27;s favour in accordance with the  terms\nof the contract entered into between them.\n   (2)\t  The  appellants  will be directed to join  in\t the\nconveyance to the extent indicated above.\n   (3)\t  After\t the  conveyance  has  been  executed,\t the\nappellants will be paid Rs. 58,000 out of the Rs. 62,000 now\nlying in deposit in court as compensation for the loss\tthey\nhad suffered, without prejudice to any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">371</span>\nfurther\t rights\t they  may have against\t the  Nawab  or\t his\nestate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(4)After  this has been done, the Custodian, U.

We  accordingly direct  that  the  appellants\npay the plaintiff the costs of this appeal.\nThere  is an application for amendment of the  High  Court&#x27;s\ndecree.\t This will be disposed of by the High Court.\nDecree of High Court modified.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">Agent for the appellant: B.
