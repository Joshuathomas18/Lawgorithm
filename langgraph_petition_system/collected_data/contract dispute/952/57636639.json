The question falls for consideration of this Court  is\nwhether   in  view  of  provisions  contained  in  M.P./C.G.\nMadhyastham  Adhikaran  Adhiniyam,  1983  (for  short   &#x27;the\nAdhiniyam  of  1983),  the instant application  filed  under\n<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(henceforth  `the  Act  of 1996&#x27;) for  appointment  of  sole\nArbitrator is maintainable?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The  applicant-firm entered into a works  contract  on\n6.9.2006  with the respondents for the work of  construction\nof  New  Engineering  College building at  Sejbahar,  Raipur\n(C.G.).   The  agreement entered into  between  the  parties\ncontains  an  arbitration clause, i.e., clause -  28,  which\nreads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                     ARBITRATION CLAUSE:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     &quot;Clause  28: Except as otherwise provided  in  this\n     contract all question and dispute relating  to  the\n     meaning of the specification, designs, drawings and\n     instruction  herein before mentioned  as  to  thing\n     whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to\n     the   contract   designs,  drawings  specification,\n     estimte, concerning the works, or the execution  or\n     failure to execute the same, whether arising during\n     the  progress of the work, or after the abandonment\n     thereof  shall  be  referred to the  Superintending\n     Engineer  for his decision, within a period  of  30\n     (thirty) days of such an occurrence(s).  There upon\n     the  Superintending Engineer shall give his written\n     instructions  and/or decisions, after  hearing  the\n     contractor and Executive Engineer within  a  period\n     of  15 (fifteen) days of such request.  This period\n     can be extended by mutual consent of parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          Upon   receipt  of  written  instructions   or\n     decisions,  of Superintending Engineer the  parties\n     shall promptly proceed without delay to comply such\n     instructions  or decisions.  If the  Superintending\n     Engineer fails to give his instruction or decisions\n     in  writing within a period of 15 (fifteen) days or\n     mutually agreed time after being requested  and/or,\n     if  the  party(es)  is/are  aggrieved  against  the\n     decision   of  the  Superintending  Engineer,   the\n     aggrieved party may within 30 days prefer an appeal\n     to   the  Chief  Engineer,  who  shall  afford   an\n     opportunity  to the parties of being heard  and  to\n     offer evidence in support of his appeal.  The Chief\n     Engineer  will give his decision within 30 (thirty)\n     days, or such, mutually agreed period.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          If   any  party  is  not  satisfied  with  the\n     decision  of  the  Chief Engineer  he  can  file  a\n     petition   for   resolving  the   dispute   through\n     arbitration   in  the  arbitration   tribunal.    A\n     reference  to  Arbitration  Tribunal  shall  be  no\n     ground  for not continuing the work on the part  of\n     the  Contractor.  Payment as per original terms and\n     condition  of  the agreement shall be continued  by\n     the Executive Engineer in accordance with clauses 8\n     above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The  dispute and differences arose between the parties\nwith  regard  to  payment  of Rs.56,26,90,967.00  and  other\ndamages.  The applicant-firm vide letter dated 16.12.2010 by\ninvoking   arbitration  clause  28  requested   respondents&#x27;\nSuperintending  Engineer to enter  upon  the  reference  and\ndecide  their matter.  The Superintending Engineer  did  not\nrespond timely, so the petitioner has filed an appeal to the\nChief  Engineer  vide  letter dated 27.01.2011.   The  Chief\nEngineer  also  did not respond within time specified  under\nclause  28  of  the  agreement.  Hence,  vide  letter  dated\n28.02.2011 (Annexure A/7), the applicant-firm requested  the\nnon-applicants to constitute Arbitration Tribunal  in  terms\nof  arbitration clause.  The non-applicants did not  respond\nto  the  above  request also.  Hence, this  application  for\nappointment of arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Act of\n1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Shri  A.K.Mishra, learned counsel  appearing  for  the\napplicant,  would  submit:  the judgment  of  Supreme  Court\npassed  in  Civil Appeal 3747/2005, parties  being  Va  Tech\nEscher Wyass Flovel Ltd. v. M.P.S.E.B and another1, squarely \napplies in the facts and circumstances of the case, inasmuch\nas,   the   agreement  in  the  instant  case  contains   an\narbitration  clause, and therefore, this  application  filed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Act of 1996 is maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"166421160\" id=\"span_1\">5.     Per  contra,  Shri  G.D.Vaswani,  learned  Government\nAdvocate  appearing  for  the  non-applicants/State,   would\nsubmit: admittedly, the nature of the dispute is such, which\nfalls  within  the  definition  of  &quot;works  contract&quot;  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1804257/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  2  (i)</a>  of the Adhiniyam of 1983  and  one  of  the\ncontracted   parties   to   the  agreement   is   State   of\nChhattisgarh, therefore, irrespective of arbitration  clause\ncontained  in  the agreement, the dispute will  have  to  be\nreferred  to the Arbitration Tribunal in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  7</a>\nof  the  Adhiniyam 1983.  For this, he placed reliance  upon\nthe  judgment  of the Supreme Court in the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/166421160/\" id=\"a_6\">Madhya\nPradesh  Rural  Road Development Authority  and  another  v.\nL.G.Chaudhary Engineers</a> and contractors2.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6.    I  have heard counsel for the parties and perused  the\nmaterial available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.    Admittedly,  in the instant case, the  nature  of  the\ndispute  falls  within the definition  of  &quot;works  contract&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">under  <a href=\"/doc/1804257/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 2 (i)</a> of the Adhiniyam 1983 and  one  of  the\ncontracted   parties   to   the  agreement   is   State   of\nChhattisgarh.  It is also an admitted fact that the  dispute\nis  in  relation to the execution of works contract and  the\ncontract  is well in existence meaning thereby the  contract\nitself has neither been terminated, cancelled nor repudiated\nby the non-applicants.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">8.    In  Va Tech Escher Wyass Flovel Ltd. v. M.P.S.E.B  and\nanother  (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, after referring\nto  both  the Adhiniyam 1983 and the Act of 1996, held  that\nthe   Adhiniyam  1983  applies  only  where  there   is   no\narbitration  clause and the Adhiniyam 1983 stands  impliedly\nrepealed  by  the Act of 1996 where there is an  arbitration\nclause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">9.    The  exact  reasoning recorded by the Hon&#x27;ble  Supreme\nCourt  in Va Tech Escher Wyass Flovel Ltd. v. M.P.S.E.B  and \nanother (supra) is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          &quot;3.   ...  In our opinion, the 1983 Act and the\n     1996  Act can be harmonised by holding that the 1983\n     Act  only  applies  where there  is  no  arbitration\n     clause but it stands impliedly repealed by the  1996\n     Act  where there is an arbitration clause.  We  hold\n     accordingly.  Hence, the impugned judgment cannot be\n     sustained  and  we  hold that the application  under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 9</a> of the 1996 Act maintainable&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">10.   In another case, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court presided  over\nby  the  same  learned Judge who gave Va Tech  Escher  Wyass   \nFlovel  Ltd. v. M.P.S.E.B and another (supra) ruling  passed\nthe following order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           &quot;This  petition has been filed  against  the\n     judgment and order dated 11.3.2011 passed  by  the\n     High  Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior Bench  in\n     Ravi Kant Bansal v. General Manager&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166421160\" id=\"span_2\">11.   Recently, the two Judge Bench of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\nin  the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/166421160/\" id=\"a_9\">Madhya  Pradesh  Rural  Road  Development\nAuthority   and  another  v.  L.G.Chaudhary  Engineers</a>   and\ncontractors (supra) has considered the question whether  the\nprovisions of Adhiniyam 1983, which statutorily provide  for\nthe  parties to the works contract to refer all disputes  to\nArbitration  Tribunal constituted under  <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_10\">Section  7</a>  of  the\nAdhiniyam  1983  will continue to operate  in  view  of  the\nprovisions  of  the  Act of 1996, which  is  a  central  Act\nsubsequently enacted.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">12.  In the opinion of Hon&#x27;ble Shri Justice A.K.Ganguly:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">  &quot;39.  The  M.P. Act of 1983 was made when the  previous\n  <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_11\">Arbitration Act</a> of 1940 was in the field.  <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_12\">That Act</a>  of\n  1940 was a Central law.  Both the Acts operated in view\n  of  <a href=\"/doc/144997/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 46</a> of the 1940 Act.  The M.P.Act, 1983  was\n  reserved for the assent of the President and admittedly\n  received the same on 17-10-1983 which was published  in\n  the  Madhya Pradesh Gazette Extraordinary dated  12-10-\n  1983.  Therefore, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1583673/\" id=\"a_14\">article 354(2)</a>  of\n  the Constitution was satisfied.  Thus, the M.P. Act  of\n  1983   prevails   in  the  State  of  Madhya   Pradesh.\n  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"674147\" id=\"span_3\">Thereafter, the AC Act, 1996 was enacted by  Parliament\n  repealing the earlier laws of arbitration of 1940.   It\n  has  also  been noted that the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_15\">AC Act, 1996</a>  saves  the\n  provisions  of  the M.P. Act, 1983 under <a href=\"/doc/1450090/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections  2(4)</a>\n  and  <a href=\"/doc/1271430/\" id=\"a_17\">2  (5)</a>  thereof.  Therefore, there cannot  be  any\n  repugnancy.  (See the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/674147/\" id=\"a_18\">T.Barai\n  v. Henry Ah Hoe</a>, (1983), 1 SCC 177)</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">  40.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1716282\" id=\"span_4\">In  this connection the observations made  by  the\n  Constitution  Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1716282/\" id=\"a_19\">M. Karunanidhi  v.\n  Union of India</a>, (1979) 3 SCC 431 are very pertinent and\n  the  following observations are excerpted: (SCC  p.450,\n  para 37)\n\n          &quot;37.  .... It is, therefore, clear that  in\n     view  of this clear intention of the legislature\n     there  can be no room for any argument that  the\n     State  Act  was  in  any way  repugnant  to  the\n     Central Acts.  We have already pointed out  from\n     the  decisions  of the Federal  Court  and  this\n     Court  that one of the important tests  to  find\n     out as to whether or not there is repugnancy  is\n     to  ascertain  the intention of the  legislature\n     regarding the fact that the dominant legislature\n     allowed  the subordinate legislature to  operate\n     in the same field pari passu the State Act.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">  41.   It is clear from the aforesaid observations  that\n  in  the  instant case the latter Act made by Parliament\n  i.e.  the  <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_20\">AC Act, 1996</a> clearly showed an intention  to\n  the  effect that the State law of arbitration i.e.  the\n  M.P.Act  should operate in the State of Madhya  Pradesh\n  in  respect  of certain specified types of arbitrations\n  which are under the M.P.Act, 1983.  This is clear  from\n  <a href=\"/doc/72836326/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections  2  (4)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/546849/\" id=\"a_22\">2  (5)</a>  of  the  AC  Act,  1996.\n  Therefore,  there is no substance in  the  argument  of\n  repugnancy and is accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">  42.   Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the judgment\n  of the High Court which is based on the reasoning of Va\n  Tech  is set aside.  This Court holds that the decision\n  in  Va  Tech has been rendered per incuriam.   In  that\n  view  of  the  matter  the arbitration  proceeding  may\n  proceed under the M.P. Act of 1983 and not under the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_23\">AC\n  Act, 1996</a>.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">13.   However,  Hon&#x27;ble  Justice  Gyan  Sudha  Misra,  while\nconcurring  and  endorsing the reasonings  assigned  in  the\njudgment  of Hon&#x27;ble Shri Justice A.K.Ganguly has  delivered\npartly  disagreeing opinion.  According to  Hon&#x27;ble  Justice\nGyan  Sudha  Misra, the question as to whether  the  dispute\nwould  be referred to the M.P.Arbitration Tribunal in  terms\nof  Section  7  of the Adhiniyam 1983 or to  an  independent\narbitrator under the Act of 1996 will depend upon  the  fact\nwhether  the works contract is existing between the  parties\nor  not  out of which the dispute has arisen.  In case,  the\nworks contract itself has been repudiated/cancelled, then in\nview   of  its  non-existence,  Section  7  of  the  M.P.Act\npertaining to reference of dispute to the Tribunal would not\ncome into play at all by virtue of the fact that the dispute\nrelating  to  execution  of  works  contract  alone  can  be\nreferred  to the Tribunal in view of the specific nature  of\nworks  contract  enumerated within the definition  of  works\ncontract  under  the Act of 1983.  However, when  the  works\ncontract  itself becomes non-existence as a  consequence  of\nits cancellation, the matter will have to be referred to  an\nindependent arbitrator under the Act of 1996 and not to  the\nM.P.State Arbitration Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">14.   Thus, in view of some divergence of the view expressed\nin  the  two judgments delivered by both the Hon&#x27;ble Judges,\nthe  matter was placed by their Lordships to the Hon&#x27;ble the\nChief  Justice of India for constituting a larger  Bench  to\nresolve the divergence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">15.   A careful reading of the judgment of Supreme Court  in\nthe  case referred herein above would reveal: in the opinion\nof  both  the  Hon&#x27;ble  Judges, if there  is  a  dispute  in\nrelation  to execution of works contract within the  meaning\nof <a href=\"/doc/121249/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2 (i)</a> of the Adhiniyam 1983, then irrespective of\nfact whether the agreement contains an arbitration clause or\nnot, the dispute is required to be referred to the M.P./C.G.\nArbitration Tribunal for adjudication.  Their Lordships have\ndiffered  in their opinion in a case when the works contract\nitself   has   been  terminated/cancelled   or   repudiated.\nTherefore,  the above ratio of law <a href=\"/doc/1716282/\" id=\"a_25\">laid down by</a> the  Supreme\nCourt  squarely  applies in cases where the  dispute  is  in\nrelation  to execution of a works contract and the  same  is\nneither terminated nor cancelled  or repudiated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1716282\" id=\"span_5\">16.   Coming  to the facts of the present case,  admittedly,\nthe  contract  is  a works contract within  the  meaning  of\n<a href=\"/doc/121249/\" id=\"a_26\">Section  2  (i)</a>  of the Adhiniyam 1983.  The dispute  is  in\nrelation  to execution of a works contract and the  contract\nis  well  in existence, inasmuch as, the dispute is  not  in\nrelation to termination/cancellation or repudiation  of  the\ncontract.   Therefore, the ratio of law  <a href=\"/doc/1716282/\" id=\"a_27\">laid  down  by</a>  the\nSupreme  Court  in the case referred herein  above  squarely\napplies  in the facts and circumstances of the present  case\nand I am of the opinion, the remedy of the applicant-firm is\nto refer the matter for adjudication to the C.G. Madhyastham\nTribunal  constituted  under the  Adhiniyam  1983  and  this\napplication filed under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Act of 1996 is\nnot maintainable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">17.   In  view  of  above,  the  application  is  dismissed.\nHowever,  the  applicant-firm  is  at  liberty  to  move  an\napplication  before  the Chhattisgarh  Madhyastham  Tribunal\nconstituted under the Adhiniyam 1983.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">                                                       Judge\n</p>","numcites":17,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Chattisgarh High Court","citetid":57636639,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"adhiniyam, 1983","formInput":"adhiniyam%2C%201983"},{"value":"works contract","formInput":"works%20contract"},{"value":"escher wyass flovel","formInput":"escher%20wyass%20flovel"},{"value":"va tech","formInput":"va%20tech"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"\\\"works contract\\\"  ","formInput":"%5C%22works%20contract%5C%22%20%20"},{"value":"mutual","formInput":"mutual"},{"value":"repudiation","formInput":"repudiation"},{"value":"arbitration act","formInput":"arbitration%20act"},{"value":"repugnancy","formInput":"repugnancy"},{"value":"\"arbitration clause\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20clause%22"},{"value":"11(6)","formInput":"11%286%29"}],"cats":[{"value":"finance","formInput":"tag:finance"},{"value":"arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"definitions","formInput":"tag:definitions"},{"value":"arbitration-and-conciliation","formInput":"tag:arbitration-and-conciliation"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
