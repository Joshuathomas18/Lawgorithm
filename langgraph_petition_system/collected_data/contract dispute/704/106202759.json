It has further been argued by learned Counsel for the appellant\n                                         that loss of security in the form of original title deeds will not\n                                         come with the purview of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_31\">SARFAESI Act</a>.

Lastly, it has been argued that Clause 12.17 of the loan\n                                        agreement covers loss of documents and, hence, arbitration is\n                                        the only mode of adjudication.

Therefore, in cases where there is\n                                            an arbitration clause in the agreement, it is obligatory\n                                            for the court to refer the parties to arbitration in terms\n                                            of their arbitration agreement and nothing remains to\n                                            be decided in the original action after such an\n                                            application is made except to refer the dispute to an\n                                            arbitrator. Therefore, it is clear that if, as contended by a\n                                            party in an agreement between the parties before the civil\n                                            court, there is a clause for arbitration, it is mandatory for\n                                            the civil court to refer the dispute to an arbitrator. In the\n                                            instant case the existence of an arbitral clause in the\n                                            agreement is accepted by both the parties as also by the\n                                            courts below but the applicability thereof is disputed by\n                                            the respondent and the said dispute is accepted by the\n                                            courts below. Be that as it may, at the cost of repetition,\n                                            we may again state that the existence of the arbitration\n                                            clause is admitted. If that be so, in view of the mandatory\n                                            language of <a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 8</a> of the Act, the courts below ought\n                                            to have referred the dispute to arbitration.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">                                                 ...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">                                                 13.

There is a lot of difference between the\n                                            two approaches. Once it is brought to the notice of the\n                                            court that its jurisdiction has been taken away in terms of\n                                            the procedure prescribed under a special statute, the civil\n                                            court should first see whether there is ouster of\n                                            jurisdiction in terms or compliance with the procedure\n                                            under the special statute.

To appreciate the clause in question, it is necessary to\n                                     appositely understand the anatomy of the clause. It stipulates\n                                     the caption given to the clause &quot;dispute handling&quot;. It states\n                                     that the disputes should be settled through consultation and if\n                                     the consultation fails by treatment of to the arbitration body\n                                     for arbitration or the court. On a query being made, the\n                                     learned counsel for the parties very fairly stated that though\n                                     the translation is not happily worded, yet it postulates that the\n                                     words &quot;arbitration or the court&quot; are indisputable as far as the\n                                     adjudication of the disputes is concerned. There is assertion\n                                     that disputes have arisen between the parties. The intention of\n                                     the parties, as it flows from the clause, is that efforts have to\n                                     be made to settle the disputes in an amicable manner and,\n                                     therefore, two options are available, either to go for\n                                     arbitration or for litigation in a court of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1679578\" id=\"span_118\">8.

The moment the Appellant\n                          exercises the option, the arbitration agreement ceases to have any effect i.e.,\n                          the option of arbitration can be abandoned at the will of Appellant only. The\n                          above clause nowhere mentions that the respondent has the same right.\n                          Thus, the option to give a go-bye to the Arbitration agreement is only\n                          available to the Appellant and not to the Respondent. Such a clause destroys\n                          the essential feature of an Arbitration agreement i.e. of mutuality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1599742\" id=\"span_142\">22.    The clause negates the essential element of an arbitration agreement,\n                          which is, mutual promise to submit differences to arbitration i.e. mutuality.\n                          Mutuality does not permit reservation of the right of reference to arbitration\n                          to only one party.

The ambiguity in clause 64 makes two\n                                  interpretations possible: either the clause means, as the\n                                  contractor says, that only he can demand a reference; or, as is\n                                  contended by the Railway, that both parties can invoke it. The\n                                  question which at once arises is whether, in law, there can be\n                                  an arbitration agreement reserving the right of reference to\n                                  only one party. For, if there cannot be an arbitration agreement\n                                  of that kind, the only way of sustaining the clause is by\n                                  consturning it as conferring bilateral rights. This is how the\n                                  question, which I posed at the beginning of this judgment, has\n                                  arisen.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                                          45. A new aspect canvassed was „that a one-sided\n                                  option, is an infringement of the doctrine of &quot;mutuality&quot;. It was\n                                  stifled with the retort „that the doctrine of mutuality which was\n                                  one of the defences in English Law to an action for specific\n                                  performance has been deliberately left out from the <a href=\"/doc/1671917/\" id=\"a_93\">Specific\n                                  Relief Act</a> by the Legislature and .... is not applicable to India‟.\n                                  Certainly this is unexceptionable. Indeed, in the Specific Relief\n                                  Act 1963, <a href=\"/doc/93507543/\" id=\"a_94\">section 20(4)</a> now expressly says: „The court shall not\n                                  refuse to any party specific performance of a contract merely on\n                                  the ground that the contract is not enforceable at the instance of\n                                  the other party‟. But it is one thing to say that specific\n                                  performance may be granted despite want of mutuality in a\n                                  contract, and quite another to say that the inherent requirement,\n                                  of a particular category of contracts is „mutuality‟. An\n                                  arbitration agreement is unthinkable except as comprising\n                                  mutual promises. Its very nature so dictates. The law of specific\n                                  performance does not touch this question. It may well be that\n                                  Mr. Aston misapprehended the submission made to him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"987923\" id=\"span_149\">46. „Mutuality‟ was expressly recognised as an\n                                  indispensable ingredient of an arbitration agreement\n                                  in <a href=\"/doc/987923/\" id=\"a_95\">Harittina Italian Steamship Company v.

In the case before the Court of Appeal, the question for\n                               consideration was that if there was a want of mutuality, can such an\n                               agreement be called an arbitration agreement? The answer given\n                               was in the negative. Therefore, what the Court of the appeal held\n                               was that in order to invoke the arbitration clause, there has to be\n                               mutuality. But in the case in hand, the right had been reserved by\n                               the defendant of taking its disputes only to arbitration and nowhere\n                               the right was given to the contractor i.e. the plaintiff for invoking\n                               the arbitration clause. Therefore, apparently this clause suffers for\n                               want of mutuality.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199707267\" id=\"span_172\">He has then placed reliance on the decision of\n                               the Calcutta High Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/199707267/\" id=\"a_100\">Union of India v. Ratilal R.\n                               Taunk</a> reported in ILR 1966 (2) Calcutta, Page 527. In the case\n                               before the Calcutta High Court, a contractor had instituted a suit\n                               for recovery against the UOI pleading therein that the contract\n                               agreement was voidable because of mutual mistake of facts and\n                               alternatively it was voidable as it was based on mis-representation.\n                               UOI took up the plea that the suit was not maintainable because of\n                               arbitration clause embodied in the contract document. The question\n                               before that Court was whether an arbitration agreement is\n                               unilateral if one of the party only had the option to refer the\n                               disputes and differences to arbitration; whether such option can be\n                               validly accepted in law at the instance of other parties. It was held\n                               that according to <a href=\"/doc/1430346/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Arbitration Act. When an\n                               arbitration agreement gives an option or liberty to only one of the\n                               parties to agree to submit, present or future differences to\n                               arbitration, it is not an arbitration agreement, there must be an\n                               unqualified or unconditional agreement in favour of all the parties\n                               to exercise the option to submit present or future differences to\n                               arbitration. In order to be valid and binding, such agreement must\n                               be bilateral and not unilateral. Mr. Banati, therefore contended that\n                               this arbitration clause 18 is unilateral because by this clause\n                               defendant reserved to itself the right to go in for arbitration.

Therefore such a clause cannot be called an\n                               arbitration clause. There is no binding arbitration agreement\n                               between the parties nor the Court can stay the suit on the basis of\n                               clause 18. Relying on the Calcutta decision Mr. Banati contended\n                               that even if defendant has chose n to invoke the provisions of this\n                               clause, still such a clause would be void for want of mutuality.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">                                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1928143\" id=\"span_179\">On the other hand Ms. Kumkum Sen appearing for the\n                               defendant contended that there is no question of want of mutuality\n                               in this case. The parties agreed to refer their disputes arisen\n                               between them to arbitration, therefore, no fresh consent was\n                               necessary to strengthen her argument. She placed reliance on the\n                               Division Bench Judgement of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1928143/\" id=\"a_102\">P.C.\n                               Aggarwal,         Appellant v.

Relying on the\n                               observation <a href=\"/doc/1928143/\" id=\"a_103\">in that case</a>, Ms. Sen contended that the consent by the\n                               plaintiff had been given in advance for submission to arbitration.\n                               This consent makes this clause bilateral and not unilateral this\n                               consent was given in advance it can be now acted upon. The\n                               defendant has in fact already acted upon the same. The previous\n                               consent will bind the plaintiff throughout. In this case the plaintiff\n                               after going through the contents of the arbitration clause entered\n                               into this agreement and thus bound himself with the same. Now\n                               since the disputes have arisen the matter has to be referred to\n                               arbitration. It does not behave on the part of the plaintiff to allege\n                               that it is unilateral clause. Even if it is mentioned in this clause that\n                               the reference will be in a particular manner, still it will be binding\n                               on the plaintiff. The actual reference to the arbitration has to be\n                               recorded as a bilateral reference. The particular mode or the\n                               manner or the language used in Clause 18 of the agreement will not\n                               make it unilateral. Unilateral reference would mean that the\n                               agreement does not include reference of future disputes to\n                               Arbitration. If it is simply mentioned that in case of dispute those\n                               would be decided by Arbitration then such a clause cannot be\n                               called bilateral because it does not include reference of future\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                          FAO(OS) 40/2020                                                        Page 27 of 36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">By:AMIT ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">Signing Date:24.11.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">16:57:23</span>\n                                disputes to Arbitration. But if the arbitration agreement between\n                               the parties includes the reference of future disputes to arbitration\n                               then the parties, or one of the parties, will have an option to\n                               proceed either under the provisions of Chapter II or under the\n                               provisions of Chapter III in proceeding with the reference. That is\n                               called bilateral clause. The Division Bench decision quoted by the\n                               respondent does not help him, because <a href=\"/doc/1928143/\" id=\"a_104\">in that case</a> the option was\n                               given to both the parties to invoke the arbitration clause.

But that is not the case in hand. In the case\n                               in hand the right to invoke the arbitration is restricted only to the\n                               defendant. This to my mind, would not amount to bilateral\n                               arbitration clause nor the pre-consent can validate such a clause.\n                               The language used in Clause 18 clearly show it is one sided. Only\n                               disputes of defendants could be referred to Arbitration. The term\n                               arbitration agreement has been defined in the act which\n                               presupposes that the parties must agree mutually that in case of\n                               any dispute having arisen between them, the have the option to\n                               invoke the said clause. Therefore, the point for consideration\n                               before the Division Bench was not as in this case. In this case\n                               right is only given to the defendant to invoke the arbitration\n                               clause without any option to plaintiff. That being so this clause 18\n                               cannot be called bilateral. Prior giving of consent for such a\n                               clause would not make it bilateral. The facts of this case are\n                               somewhat similar to the facts of Calcutta High Court which\n                               decision will squarely apply to the facts of this case. In view of my\n                               above observation I am of the opinion such a clause as clause 18\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                          FAO(OS) 40/2020                                                    Page 28 of 36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">By:AMIT ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">Signing Date:24.11.2021</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">16:57:23</span>\n                                 cannot be called an arbitration clause.

In the opinion of this Court, such\n                                      type of absolute restriction is clearly hit by the provisions of\n                                      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act besides it being against the\n                                      public policy.

A bare perusal of the section clearly shows that while &quot;some or all\n                          disputes&quot; can be referred to the arbitration, the parties are not at the liberty\n                          to split the claims which arise out of the same defined legal relationship i.e.\n                          there cannot be a valid arbitration clause providing for arbitration of claims\n                          of one party and providing for the remedy of the Court or any other fora for\n                          the claim of the other party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">                          34.    In the present case, the appellant is within the purview of the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_116\">SARFAESI Act</a> even though it was not on the date of entering into the\n                          agreement containing the arbitration clause. The moment the appellant\n                          comes within the purview of the SARFAESI Act and DRT Act, the\n                          appellant has the option to enforce the security under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_117\">SARFAESI Act</a>\n                          and to proceed to recover dues under the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_118\">SARFAESI Act</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/1683455/\" id=\"a_119\">DRT Act</a>\n                          and then the Arbitration provisions, at the option of the appellant, will cease\n                          to have effect. However, the appellant asserts that loss of security in the\n                          form of original title deeds will not come with the purview of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_120\">SARFAESI\n                          Act</a>. Hence in the case of loss of documents, resort to arbitration is the only\n                          option available to the respondent, meaning thereby, that in respect of the\n                          claim of the appellant i.e. recovery of dues from the respondent, the\n                          arbitration will cease and the SARFAESI will be enforced but since there\n                          are no dues recoverable and only recovery of loss documents remains, the\n                          arbitration will continue to have the effect (the claims of Respondent against\n                          the appellant).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">                          35.
