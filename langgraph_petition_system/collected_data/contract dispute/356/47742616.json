The basic question, however, is whether in a summary suit based on a\n            hundi the defendant can invoke the arbitration clause contained in the\n            contract, under which the goods for the price of which the hundies were\n\n\n\n\n\n            drawn, were supplied.

As\n            mentioned above the suits out of which these appeals arise are summary suits\n            based on the negotiable instruments viz. the hundies. It is also pertinent to\n            note in this context that the hundies were drawn in favour of the State Bank\n            of India and were endorsed in favour of the respondents who thus became\n            the holders in due course of the hundies. It will also be seen from the\n            hundies that the goods were received by the appellants before the hundies\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">    ::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2016                                ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2016 00:56:21 :::</span>\n                                                                10                           osapp556\n\n            were drawn.

The effect of such a\n            transaction ordinarily is that the defendants&#x27; liability to the plaintiffs for the\n            invoice value of the goods is discharged, and a liability to the Bank under the bills\n            is substituted therefor. The defendants could not be liable to both, that is to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                \n            plaintiffs for the price of goods and to the bank for acceptance of the bills under\n            <a href=\"/doc/1578249/\" id=\"a_32\">S. 32</a>, Negotiable Instruments Act, which clearly provides that the acceptor before\n            maturity of a bill of exchange is bound to pay the amount thereof at maturity\n            according to the apparent tenor of acceptance.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">            In that case by virtue of Clause 3 of the agreement the respondents were\n            empowered to claim the invoice value in spite of the acceptance of the bills.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                 \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">            Discussing the effect of this clause the learned Judges observed further as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">            &quot;It is, of course, implied that if the sellers elect to sue for the invoice value on the\n                             \n            basis of the original contract they would secure for the buyers immunity against\n            any claim on the basis of the bill and, conversely, if the buyers&#x27; acceptance of the\n            bill is enforced, they are absolved of their liability under the original contract. But\n            for Cl. (c) the legal position would have been only this: after acceptance followed\n                            \n            by maturity of the bill the buyers would have been liable only to the bank which\n            alone would be liable to the sellers according to the terms of the agreement\n            between them, under which the sellers drew the bill of exchange in favour of the\n            bank. The sellers have however reserved to themselves an alternative remedy of\n            falling back on the original consideration. It is only if they avail themselves of this\n            remedy and their claim is contested that a dispute will arise &#x27;out of a contract\n      \n\n            entered into in connection with this agreement&#x27;, within the meaning of the\n            arbitration clause quoted above marked (d). If on the other hand, the suit is based\n            on the bill and a dispute arises in such suit, it cannot be said to arise out of any\n   \n\n\n\n            contract between the parties &quot;in connection with the agreement&quot; but it arises\n            between one of the parties to it and a third person in connection with the\n            acceptance of the bill, a transaction collateral to but not arising out of the\n            agreement.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">            In the ultimate analysis the learned Judges spelt out their view of the case as\n\n\n\n\n\n            follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">            &quot;The draft was drawn in favour of the Chartered Bank, and it was the Chartered\n            Bank who had in the first instance a right to recover the sum due on the draft\n            from the acceptor. Had the Bank sued on the acceptance, clearly the acceptors\n            could not have pleaded that under an agreement between themselves and a third\n            party, namely, the sellers of the goods, they had a right to refer the matter to\n            arbitration. No question as to the nature of the goods arose between the present\n\n\n\n\n\n            appellants and the Chartered Bank, and there was no agreement between them\n            containing any clause authorising a reference to arbitration. The Chartered Bank\n            endorsed the bills of exchange to the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs in bringing this\n            suit on the basis of the bills of exchange are in the position of the Chartered Bank,\n            and therefore entitled to frame their suit accordingly. Their position in this\n            respect is the same as that of a total stranger to whom the Bank might endorse\n            the bills. A suit brought by them for the price of the goods will bring into\n            operation the arbitration clause of the agreement between themselves as sellers\n            and the defendants as buyers. But there is no agreement and no arbitration\n            clause which can come into force as between the plaintiffs as holders and the\n            defendants as acceptors of the bills of exchange.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1762330\" id=\"span_17\">As mentioned above all the hundies in question in these suits were drawn in\n            favour of the State Bank of India and were endorsed to the respondents by\n            the bank.

It is the\n            case of the applicant that the goods which were delivered by the plaintiff-\n            respondent were defective and damaged and there was also failure to deliver the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \n            goods in time as a consequence whereof the applicant had suffered damages and\n            in respect of which the applicant is entitled to claim the damages.

These written\n            contracts contained arbitration clauses to the following effect:--\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">            &quot;If  any dispute or differences shall arise between the buyer and the seller\n            concerning this order it shall be referred to arbitration in Calcutta under the rules\n\n\n\n\n                                                              \n            of the Tribunal of Arbitration of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Calcutta and\n            any award or awards made shall be final and binding on both the parties.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                           2. It is the case of the applicant that as the suit related to the\n            hundies which were given in discharge of the obligations for payment in\n            respect of delivery of the goods and as there were disputes as to the quality\n            and time for delivery of the goods, the disputes that the applicant was\n\n\n\n\n                                               \n            raising were covered by the arbitration agreements and as such the suit\n            under Order 37 filed by the respondent/plaintiff should be stayed. The first\n            question that requires consideration in this case, is, whether the suit is in\n                             \n            respect of the matter agreed to be referred to arbitration under the clauses\n            of the contracts mentioned hereinbefore. Counsel for the respondent\n            contended that the suit was only a suit on the negotiable instruments and his\n            client had accepted the negotiable instruments, namely, the hundies in this case\n                            \n            in discharge of the right to get payment and his cause of action was based on the\n            said negotiable instruments and as such the arbitration clauses did not cover or\n            did not contemplate any dispute in respect of the suit filed by the plaintiff on the\n            negotiable instruments given in discharge of the boligation for payment. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"641256\" id=\"span_23\">In\n            support of this argument counsel for the respondent drew my attention to the\n            decision of the Supreme Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/641256/\" id=\"a_49\">Commr. of Income-tax, Bombay South,\n      \n\n            Bombay v. Ogale Glass Works Ltd.</a> , AIR 1954 SC 429 where the Supreme Court\n            observed that when it was said that a payment by negotiable instrument was a\n            conditional payment, what was meant was that such payment was subject to a\n   \n\n\n\n            condition subsequent that if the negotiable instrument was dishonoured on\n            presentation, the creditor might consider it as waste paper and resort to his\n            original demand.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"658976\" id=\"span_24\">In my opinion the proposition that negotiable instrument gives a\n            cause of action independent as such and of original consideration cannot be\n            disputed, but that proposition, in my opinion, has no relevance in determining the\n\n\n\n\n\n            present controversy before me. Reliance was also placed on the decision of the\n            Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/658976/\" id=\"a_50\">Ramlal Onkarmal Firm v. Mohanlal Jogani Rice and\n            Atta Mills</a>, AIR 1965 SC 1679 and on the observations at pages 1681 and 1682 of\n            the report. This case in my opinion held the similar proposition and is not quite\n            germane to the point in issue before me. Looking at the arbitration clauses it\n            appears to me that the clauses were wide enough to include a dispute arising in\n            respect of a discharge of the obligation for payment. Therefore, even if there\n            has been a discharge of the obligation for payment by the negotiable\n\n\n\n\n\n            instrument and acceptance thereafter by the buyer if dispute is raised\n            regarding the delivery of the goods, in respect of which the negotiable\n            instruments were given then in view of the amplitude of the arbitration\n            clauses such disputes are covered by the arbitration agreements. Therefore,\n            in this case when the applicant/defendant is contending that the goods\n            delivered were defective and were not in time and as such the discharge of\n            obligation for payment in this case was made wrongfully and was liable to\n            be refunded, the disputes, regarding the same is in my opinion referable\n            and concerning the order of the contracting parties and in that view of the\n            matter I am of the opinion that it should be held that the disputes are\n            covered by the arbitration agreements.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                                                                (emphasis added)\n                \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">    ::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2016                               ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2016 00:56:21 :::</span>\n                                             15                           osapp556\n\n\n\n     17         In   the   present   case,   we   have   perused   the \n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n     affidavit in support of the Notice of Motion filed \n     by   the   defendants.

In \n     paragraph 6 of the affidavit, it is admitted   that \n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     the   goods   were   delivered   by   the   plaintiffs   in \n     Russia.   Only   dispute   raised   is   that   the   Bills   of \n     Exchange were not accepted by the defendants. Though \n\n\n\n\n                                  \n     this defence is specifically pleaded, no dispute is \n                             \n     raised whatsoever about the quantity and/or quality \n     of the goods admittedly supplied by the plaintiffs. \n</p>                            \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">     The   Calcutta   High   Court   dealt   with   a   case   where   a \n     dispute was raised regarding delivery.

In the present \n   \n\n\n\n     case, only dispute seems to be about the  liability \n     based   on   the   Bills   of   Exchange.   Therefore,   the \n\n\n\n\n\n     decision of the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta \n     High Court will have no application in the present \n     case.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">     18       Perusal of the plaint in the present case shows \n     that there is no prayer made even in the alternative \n     for the price of the goods sold or delivered.
