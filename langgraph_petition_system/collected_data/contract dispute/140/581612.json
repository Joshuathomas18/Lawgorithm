(hereinafter called &quot;the petitioner&quot;).  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.\tThe said order is assailed mainly on two grounds, firstly, that \nthere was no live issue in existence in between the parties and the \nlearned Judge erred in holding that there was a live issue in between \nthe parties and secondly that the claim had become barred by \nlimitation between the parties.  As against this the respondents \nM/s.Utility Premises (P) Ltd., supported the order and pointed out that \nin pursuance of the order passed not only had the Arbitrator been \nappointed but they had also chosen the third Arbitrator to preside \nover the Arbitral Tribunal and the Arbitral Tribunal had commenced its \nproceedings.  Presently the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal \nare stayed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">4.\tIt has, therefore, to be decided as to whether the order passed \nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act appointing the Arbitrators is good order \nin law particularly in the wake of the above two objections.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.\tFollowing undisputed facts would have to be borne in mind \nbefore approaching the questions raised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.\tThe appellant is a company incorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_3\">Companies \nAct, 1956</a>, so also the respondent.  The appellant company became a \nsick industrial unit sometime in the year 1987 under the <a href=\"/doc/438563/\" id=\"a_4\">Sick \nIndustrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985</a> (hereinafter \nreferred to as &quot;the SICA&quot;).  It was ordered to be wound up in the year \n1994 and on approaching the Board For Industrial and Financial \nReconstruction (BIFR) a rehabilitation scheme was worked out \nwhereby IDBI was appointed as an operating agency under the \nscheme.  The Asset Sale Committee approved the sale of 1.20 lakh \nsq.ft. FSI owned by the appellant company to the respondent for a \ntotal sale consideration of Rs.21.60 crores and accordingly an \nagreement came to be executed in between the parties on 27.4.1994.  \nThis was a Joint Development Agreement between the parties in \nrespect of the land owned by the appellant. By Clause 1 of the \nagreement, the area mentioned for development was between 86,000 \nsq.ft to 1.20 lakh sq.ft. Clause 15 of the said agreement provides that \nthe land owner, the appellant herein, shall not create any \nencumbrance or third party rights.  By Clause 19 the appellant had \nundertaken to add additional FSI. By Clause 22 the period was fixed \nfor utilization of the full FSI covered under the agreement. Clause 24 \nwas the Arbitration Clause to resolve the disputes, if any, between \nthe parties. The property covered was described in the Third \nSchedule of the said agreement which mentions 1.20 lakh sq.ft. FSI.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.\tAfter this agreement a second agreement came to be executed \nin between the parties on 18.7.1994.  This was necessitated because \nthe appellant herein could make available only 86,725 sq.ft. FSI.  \nUnder this second agreement it was agreed to by the appellant herein \nthat the further land admeasuring 2500 sq.mtrs. would be allowed to \nbe developed by the respondent.  The said 2500 sq.mtrs. land was \nreserved by Bombay Municipal Corporation for Municipal Primary \nSchool and playground.  However, the appellant herein undertook to \nshift the said reservation to some other property of the appellant at \nthe cost of the respondent.  There was an arbitration clause vide \nClause No.10 in this agreement also.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">8.\tOn 9.11.1994 there was a Tripartite Agreement between the \nappellant and respondent herein along with one Bhupendra Capital \nand Finance Limited whereby 50% of the appellant&#x27;s entire interest \nunder the Agreement dated 27.4.1994 and 18.7.1994  was agreed to \nbe transferred.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">9.\tOn 22.6.1996 the agreement dated 18.7.1994 was cancelled by \nmutual consent as the parties were unable to agree on the cost of \nshifting the reservation which was agreed to in the agreement dated \n18.7.1994. It was, therefore, agreed vide clause 5 that the respondent \nand the third party brought in, i.e., Bhupendra Capital and Finance \nLtd., would have no right or claim in respect of the said property \nbelonging to the appellant and more particularly described in the First \nSchedule, save and except, the 86725 sq.ft. FSI.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">10.\tOn 28.6.1996 the respondent herein entered into an \nAssignment Agreement with Ansal Housing and Construction to build \nflats on the area with FSI of 86725 sq.ft.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">11.\tOn 4.5.2001 the respondent herein had filed a petition under \n<a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a> of the Act seeking injunction and appointment of Receiver \nin respect of 2500 sq.mtrs. of land.  However, that was dismissed by \nthe High Court on the ground that the area was covered under the \nagreement dated 18.7.1994 and it was cancelled by an agreement \ndated 22.6.1996 and, therefore, the application was not maintainable.  \nThe appeal against this order also failed vide order dated 3.6.2002.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">12.\tOn 12.9.2001 respondent and one Santosh Singh Bagla who \nwas the Promoter of the respondent company, filed application before \nthe Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction \n(AAIFR) contending therein that the promoters of the petitioner \ncompany were guilty of misfeasance and hence those acts were \nliable to be inquired into.  It was secondly prayed that the Board of \nDirectors of the appellant company should be superseded.  It was \nthirdly prayed that the injunction be issued restraining the appellant \nfrom selling or transferring the lands.  This application was dismissed \nby AAIFR leaving the parties to get the disputes adjudicated before \nan appropriate forum.  It is to be noted here that a specific statement \nwas made before the AAIFR by the respondent herein that the sale of \n1.20 lakh sq.ft. was not the subject matter of the application as the \nseparate proceedings were being contemplated before the \nappropriate forum.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">13.\tOn 11.6.2002 the respondent served a notice invoking the \narbitration clause under agreements dated 27.4.1994 and 18.7.1994 \non the ground that the petitioner had denied its liability to transfer the \nFSI beyond 86725 sq.ft. though it was bound to make available FSI of \n1.20 lakh sq.ft. to the respondents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">14.\tThe respondent and Shri Santosh Singh Bagla filed a writ \npetition in the Delhi High Court on 26.7.2004 whereby they \nchallenged the order passed by the AAIFR dated 12.9.2001. Though \nthe respondents had, in their appeal before AAIFR, claimed that the \nsale of 1.20 lakh sq.ft. of FSI was not the subject matter of that \napplication, it was all the same prayed before the High Court in the \nwrit petition that the appellant should be restrained from transferring \nthe additional FSI left with them.  Thereupon an undertaking was \ngiven by the counsel for the appellant that the appellant would not sell \nthe property which was covered in the agreement dated 27.4.1994.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">15.\tOn 6.8.2004 the appellant agreed to mortgage the property \ncovered by the agreement dated 27.4.1994 in favour of IL&amp;FS for \nRs.50 crores.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">16.\tOn 15.10.2004 the appellant company was released from SICA \nas it became viable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">17.\tAt this juncture on 19.1.2005 a Memorandum of Understanding \n(MoU) was signed between the parties to settle all disputes between \nthem which naturally included the issue regarding the transfer of 1.20 \nlakh sq.ft. of FSI.  The respondent under the same agreed to accept \n1.20 crores out of which a payment of Rs.10 lakhs was already made \nby the appellant to the respondent.  The appellant also agreed to \nexecute the necessary conveyance deed as per agreement dated \n27.4.1994 and 22.6.1996 thereby seeking to confine the claim of the \nrespondent to 86725 sq.ft. of FSI.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">18.\tThis MoU was cancelled by the respondent on 8.3.2005 and \nthe respondent returned the amount of Rs.10 lakhs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">19.\tThe respondent invoked the Arbitration Clause under the \nAgreements dated 27.4.1994 and 18.7.1994 by a notice dated \n24.5.2005.  The said notice was replied to by the appellant vide its \nreply dated 21.6.2005 denying its liability and as a result an \nArbitration Petition under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act was filed on \n1.7.2005 for appointing Shri S.C. Agarwal as the Sole Arbitrator.  It is \nthis application which was disposed of by the learned Judge on \n11.8.2006 which is the subject matter of the present proceedings \nbefore us at the instance of the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">20.\tAs has been stated earlier, the learned Senior Counsel Shri \nSalve basically raised two points, they being (i) that there was no live \nissue left in between the parties and controversy had become dead; \nand (ii) that the claim, if any, of the respondent had become barred by \nlimitation.  In support of his arguments the learned counsel \npainstakingly took us through the whole record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">21.\tShortly stated the argument of the learned counsel is that there \nis no live issue remaining between the parties particularly in respect \nof 1.20 lakh sq.ft. of FSI.  Learned counsel points out firstly that the \nsubject of 1.20 lakh sq.ft. of FSI being made available under the \nagreement dated 27.4.1994 was finally given a decent burial by the \nparties by the MoU dated 19.1.2005 whereunder the respondent had \nspecifically agreed to restrict his claim only to 86725 sq.ft. of FSI \ncovered under the agreement dated 27.4.1994.  He points out that in \npursuance of that MoU not only did the respondent accept the draft of \nRs.10 lakhs out of the total agreed amount of Rs.1.20 crores but also \nproceeded to encash the same.  Learned counsel points out that on a \nsecond thought the respondent proceeded to cancel the said \nagreement and thereupon proceeded to serve an arbitration notice on \n24.5.2005.  Learned counsel, therefore, points out that firstly it cannot \nbe said that respondents had any right under the agreement dated \n27.4.1994 left with it and if at all there were any such rights, they \nwere crystallized vide the MoU dated 19.1.2005 wherein it had \nspecifically agreed to give up the rest of the claim barring the claim of \n86725 sq.ft. FSI and the appellant would have no qualms about the \nclaim of 86725 sq.ft. FSI and it would always be prepared to convey \nthe same in terms of the agreement dated 27.4.1994.  Learned \ncounsel argues that having a second thought regarding the MoU \ndated 19.1.2005 the respondent cannot be allowed to wriggle out of \nits liabilities and fall back upon the agreement dated 27.4.1994 which \nhad become an antiquated agreement.  If at all it has any rights, \nthose rights would be in terms of the MoU dated 19.1.2005. It is, \ntherefore, pointed out that there is no live issue left between the \nparties, more particularly in respect of 1.20 lakh sq.ft. FSI out of \nwhich 86725 sq.ft. FSI has already been given in possession of the \nrespondent.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">22.\tLearned counsel further argues that even if there are any rights \nleft, the claim of the respondent has become hopelessly barred by \ntime.  Learned counsel contends that the Arbitral Tribunal would now \nhave to go back to the agreement dated 27.4.1994 and interpret the \nsame to decide the rights between the parties which is not possible \nunder the law of limitation.  The learned counsel suggests a simple \ntest that a suit for specific performance of the agreement dated \n27.4.1994 would obviously be time barred and, therefore, the \nrespondent cannot have an arbitration as regards that agreement. \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">23.\tLearned counsel lastly states that while passing the order under \n<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, the issues regarding the limitation and the \njurisdiction could be left open to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, \nhowever, since the learned Designated Judge has decided those \nissues, there will be no question of the Arbitral Tribunal deciding \nthese questions and it is, therefore, that the appellant is required to \nchallenge the order under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">24.\tShri Venugopal, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on \nbehalf of the respondent, however, pointed out that the controversy \nregarding the liability of the appellant to make available 1.20 lakh \nsq.ft. of FSI was never dead as otherwise there was no question of \nthe respondent executing the MoU as late as on 19.1.2005. He points \nout that the appellant had given an undertaking in respect of that \nproperty before the Delhi High Court in a writ petition which writ \npetition is still pending before the Delhi High Court and the appellant \nis facing contempt proceedings on account of the breach of the \nundertaking.  Learned counsel further points out that firstly there was \nno necessity on the part of the appellant to extend the agreement \ndated 27.4.1994 by agreeing to handover the rest of the FSI beyond \n86725 sq.ft. by an agreement dated 18.7.1994.  It was only on \naccount of the fact that the appellant also felt bound by the \nagreement dated 27.4.1994 to transfer 1.20 lakh sq.ft. FSI under the \nagreement dated 27.4.1994 for which he had received full \nconsideration of Rs.21.60 crores.  Learned counsel was at pains to \npoint out further that in fact it was an admitted position that the \nappellant got approximately Rs.4 crores more as the respondent had \npaid a sum of Rs.25 crores approximately on behalf of the appellant \ncompany which was its financial liability.  Learned counsel points out \nthat issue regarding 1.20 lakh sq.ft. FSI was never closed and was \nalways alive between the parties which prompted the parties \nultimately to execute the MoU dated 19.1.2005.  Learned counsel \nthen points out that the respondent had cancelled the MoU later on \nrealizing that the entire property stood mortgaged by the appellant on \n6.8.2004 which also included the land measuring 4848.10 sq.ft. which \nwas the subject matter of the agreement dated 27.4.1994. He, \ntherefore, points out that the parties were continuously negotiating in \nrespect of the liability on the part of the appellant to transfer 1.20 lakh \nsq.ft. FSI and there was no resolution of that issue.  Learned counsel \npoints out that the moment the MoU was cancelled, the parties \nreverted back to their rights under the agreement dated 27.4.1994 \nand, therefore, it cannot be said that the claim of the respondent \nstood satisfied.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"954540\" id=\"span_1\">25.\tLearned counsel further points out that since liabilities under \nthe agreement dated 27.4.1994 were constantly being negotiated and \nre-negotiated in so many proceedings, it cannot be said that firstly the \nissue between the parties was dead and secondly the application \nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 11(6)</a> was barred by time.  Learned counsel in that \nbehalf relied on the reported decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/954540/\" id=\"a_10\">Hari Shankar \nSinghania &amp; Ors. Vs. Gaur Hari Singhania &amp; Ors.</a> [(2006) 4 SCC \n658].  It was lastly suggested by the learned counsel that the issue as \nto whether there was any live issue or not and the issue of limitation \ncould be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 16</a> of the Act \nand it cannot be said that those issues were finally decided by the \nlearned Judge while passing the order under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act.  \nHe points out that it is only for the purpose of appointing the Arbitrator \nthat the learned Designated Judge has referred the live issue and the \nissue of limitation.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">26.\tOn these rival contentions it has to be seen as to whether the \nlearned Judge was right in passing the order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">27.\tWe shall take up the last contention raised by the appellant \nregarding the scope of the order passed by the Chief Justice or his \nDesignate Judge.  It was contended that since the Designate Judge \nhas already given findings regarding the existence of live claim as \nalso the limitation, it would be for this Court to test the correctness of \nthe findings.  As against this it was argued by the respondent that \nsuch issues regarding the live claim as also the limitation are decided \nby the Chief Justice or his Designate not finally but for the purpose of \nmaking appointment of the Arbitrators under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act.  \nIn our opinion what the Chief Justice or his Designate does is to put \nthe arbitration proceedings in motion by appointing an Arbitrator and \nit is for that purpose that the finding is given in respect of the \nexistence of the arbitration clause, the territorial jurisdiction, live issue \nand the limitation.  It cannot be disputed that unless there is a finding \ngiven on these issues, there would be no question of proceeding with \nthe arbitration.  Shri Salve as well as Shri Venugopal invited our \nattention to the observations made in para 39 in SBP &amp; CO. vs. Patel \nEngineering Ltd. &amp; Anr. [(2005) 8 SCC 618] which are as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;It is necessary to define what exactly the Chief Justice, \napproached with an application under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11</a> of the \nAct, is to decide at that stage. Obviously, he has to decide \nhis own jurisdiction in the sense whether the party making \nthe motion has approached the right High Court.  He has \nto decide whether there is an arbitration agreement, as \ndefined in the Act and whether the person who has made \nthe request before him, is a party to such an agreement.  \nIt is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the \nquestion whether the claim was a dead one; or a long-\nbarred claim that was sought to be resurrected and \nwhether the parties have concluded the transaction by \nrecording satisfaction of their mutual rights and \nobligations or by receiving the final payment without \nobjection.  It may not be possible at that stage, to decide \nwhether a live claim made, is one which comes within the \npurview of the arbitration clause.  It will be appropriate to \nleave that question to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal \non taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims \ninvolved in the arbitration.  The Chief Justice has to \ndecide whether the applicant has satisfied the conditions \nfor appointing an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act.  \nFor the purpose of taking a decision on these aspects, the \nChief Justice can either proceed or get such evidence \nrecorded, as may be necessary.  We think that adoption \nof this procedure in the context of the Act would best \nserve the purpose sought to  be achieved by the Act of \nexpediting the process of arbitration, without too many \napproaches to the court at various stages of the \nproceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">A glance on this para would suggest the scope of order under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section \n11</a> to be passed by the Chief Justice or his Designate.  In so far as \nthe issues regarding territorial jurisdiction and the existence of the \narbitration agreement are concerned, the Chief Justice or his \nDesignate has to decide those issues because otherwise the \narbitration can never proceed.  Thus the Chief Justice has to decide \nabout the territorial jurisdiction and also whether there exists an \narbitration agreement between the parties and whether such party \nhas approached the court for appointment of the Arbitrator.  The \nChief Justice has to examine as to whether the claim is a dead one or \nin the sense whether the parties have already concluded the \ntransaction and have recorded satisfaction of their mutual rights and \nobligations or whether the parties concerned have recorded their \nsatisfaction regarding the financial claims.  In examining this if the \nparties have recorded their satisfaction regarding the financial claims, \nthere will be no question of any issue remaining.  It is in this sense \nthat the Chief Justice has to examine as to whether their remains \nanything to be decided between the parties in respect of the \nagreement and whether the parties are still at issue on any such \nmatter.  If the Chief Justice does not, in the strict sense, decide the \nissue, in that event it is for him to locate such issue and record his \nsatisfaction that such issue exists between the parties.  It is only in \nthat sense that the finding on a live issue is given.  Even at the cost of \nrepetition we must state that it is only for the purpose of finding out \nwhether the arbitral procedure has to be started that the Chief Justice \nhas to record satisfaction that their remains a live issue in between \nthe parties.  The same thing is about the limitation which is always a \nmixed question of law and fact.  The Chief Justice only has to record \nhis satisfaction that prima facie the issue has not become dead by the \nlapse of time or that any party to the agreement has not slept over its \nrights beyond the time permitted by law to agitate those issues \ncovered by the agreement.  It is for this reason that it was pointed out \nin the above para that it would be appropriate sometimes to leave the \nquestion regarding the live claim to be decided by the Arbitral \nTribunal.  All that he has to do is to record his satisfaction that the \nparties have not closed their rights and the matter has not been \nbarred by limitation.  Thus, where the Chief Justice comes to a finding \nthat there exists a live issue, then naturally this finding would include \na finding that the respective claims of the parties have not become \nbarred by limitation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">28.\tApplying these principles to the present case, it will be seen \nthat the Designate Judge has clearly recorded his satisfaction that the \nparties had not concluded their claims.  We must, at this stage, note \nthat after the first agreement which clearly covers the issue regarding \n1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI, the said issue kept haunting the parties time \nand again.  We have already referred to the agreements and their \ncancellations.  The first agreement was on 27.4.1994  which is the \nbasic agreement.  The parties then entered into a second agreement \ndated 18.7.1994 which was necessitated on account of the fact that \nthen the appellant could make available only 86725 sq.ft. of FSI.  It \nwas under this agreement that the appellant agreed that the further \nland measuring 2500 sq.mtrs. would be allowed to be developed by \nthe respondents which land was reserved by Bombay Municipal \nCorporation for Municipal Primary School and playground.  By that \nagreement, the appellant undertook to shift the said reservation to \nsome other property.  This agreement was followed by a Tripartite \nAgreement dated 9.11.1994 where a third party, namely, Bhupendra \nCapital &amp; Finance Limited joined.  On 22.6.1996 the agreement dated \n18.7.1994 was cancelled by the mutual consent as the parties were \nunable to agree regarding the cost of shifting the reservation further, \nthereby the third party, namely, Bhupendra Capital &amp; Finance Limited \nwas excluded.  If the things had remained at this stage, there was no \nquestion of the issue regarding the 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI  remaining \nalive.  However, it is clear from the developments thereafter that this \nissue remained burning in between the parties which is evident from \nthe fact that the respondents moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 9</a> of \nthe Act on 4.5.2001 in respect of 2500 sq.mtrs. of land obviously to \nsafeguard their interest regarding the 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI.  It is \nobvious that this FSI was linked with the aforementioned land \nmeasuring 2500 sq.mtrs..  Though the respondents failed in their \nattempt to get an injunction under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 9</a> of the Act, they did not \nleave the things at that and brought in the such issue firstly by serving \nthe notice dated 11.6.2002 invoking the arbitration clause and \nsecondly by including this issue in their writ petition filed before the \nDelhi High Court wherein the appellants were made to give an \nundertaking that they will not sell the property which was covered \nunder the agreement dated 27.4.1994 which obviously included the \n1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI.  Now this undertaking is still continuing.  It is \nnot for us to go into the correctness or otherwise of the order passed \nby the Delhi High Court regarding the undertaking because that is not \nthe question pending before us, however, it only shows that the \nparties had not closed the question regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI.  \nAs if all this was not sufficient, lastly the parties agreed on 19.1.2005 \nfor a MoU where this precise question came up.  There, it seems the \nrespondent had agreed to leave their claim regarding the 1,20,000 \nsq.ft. of FSI.  It, however, seems that the respondent wriggled out of \nthe MoU and cancelled it and chose to serve the arbitration notice for \nappointment of the arbitrators.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">29.\tLearned counsel Shri Salve points out that this was not \npossible as the respondent could not wriggle out of the commitment \nmade in the MoU and could not have unilaterally cancelled the MoU \nas the respondent had accepted to give up their claim for a \nconsideration of Rs.1.20 crores and had accepted part payment of \nRs.10 lakhs out of the same.  We must state here that it will not be for \nus to decide as to whether the respondents were within their rights to \nrepudiate the MoU and serve the notice of arbitration.  What would be \nthe rights of the parties on account of entering into a MoU dated \n19.1.2005 would not be for us to decide sitting in this jurisdiction.  We \nhave only to adjudge as to whether the parties were still at \nloggerheads as regards the present issue.  The very necessity felt on \ntheir part for a MoU would suggest that the issue was not closed.  \nShri Salve argues that the respondents could not be allowed now to \nrevert back on the agreement dated 27.4.1994 once it had chosen to \nclose the issue by entering into the MoU dated 19.1.2005.  Learned \nSenior Counsel sought our finding on that.  We have already clarified \nthat it will not be for us to give that finding.  In our opinion the very \nfact that the parties chose to create the MoU dated 19.1.2005 \nsuggests that the order regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI was never \nclosed or atleast was never treated to have closed and in that sense \nit was still a live issue.  Learned counsel Shri Savle relied upon the \ndecision in Nathani Steels Ltd. vs. Associated Constructions \n[(1995) Supp. (3) SCC 324].  Our attention was drawn particularly to \ncontents of paragraph 3 which are as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;\u0005once there is a full and final settlement in respect any \nparticular dispute or difference in relation to a matter \ncovered under the Arbitration clause in the contract and \nthat dispute or difference is finally settled by and between \nthe parties, such a dispute or difference does not remain \nto be an arbitrable dispute and the Arbitration clause \ncannot be invoked even though for certain other matters, \nthe contract may be in subsistence.  Once the parties \nhave arrived at a settlement in respect of any dispute or \ndifference arising under a contract and that dispute or \ndifference is amicably settled by way of a final settlement \nby and between the parties, unless that settlement set \naside in proper proceedings, it cannot lie in the mouth of \none of the parties to the settlement to spurn it on the \nground that it was a mistake and proceed to invoke the \narbitration clause.  If this is permitted the sanctity of \ncontract, the settlement also being a contract would be \nwholly lost and it would be open to one party to take the \nbenefit under the settlement and then to question the \nsame on the ground of mistake without having the \nsettlement set aside&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">Though the observations at the first blush appear to be in favour of \nthe appellants, on the closer look they are not so.  This was a case \nwhere in a contract the parties had amicably settled their disputes \nand the parties also did not dispute that the they have arrived at such \na settlement.  It is under those circumstances that the observations \nwere made.  However, we do not think that the facts in the present \ncase suggest that there was a full and final settlement in between the \nparties in respect of the issue regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI and \nthat a MoU was signed wherein the respondent and Bhupendra \nCapital &amp; Finance Limited who was the party to the third agreement, \nacknowledged that they were left with rights limited to 86,725 sq.ft. of \nFSI.  It must be seen that there is no reference whatsoever to any \nconsideration as regards the 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI, much less to the \nfigure of Rs.1.20 crores in this MoU.  As to what would be the effect \nof this MoU on the rights of the respondent herein would not be for us \nto go into but it is certain that the issue had not been settled \ncompletely.  In Nathani&#x27;s case (supra) the issue was admittedly \nsettled and that was not disputed by the parties thereto.  Here the \nparties and more particularly the respondents are seriously disputing \nthat the issue regarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI was finally settled in \nbetween the parties.  It would be only for the Arbitral Tribunal to \ndecide the effect of the respondent having signed the MoU.  We have \npointed out earlier that this MoU cannot be said to be in the nature of \na contract.  In Nathani&#x27;s case the settlement was viewed as a \ncontract and it was, therefore, reiterated that if the parties are allowed \nto wriggle out of their obligation from the contract, no sanctity would \nbe left to the settlement which are in the nature of a contract.  It is for \nthis reason that, in our opinion, the decision in Nathani&#x27;s case is not \napplicable to the present facts.  We also reiterate at this juncture that \nthe cloud on 2500 sq.mtrs. of land which is inexplicably connected \nwith the FSI of 1,20,000 sq.ft. created by the undertaking given \nbefore the Delhi High Court still remains looming large and remained  \nso even on the date of the MoU.  It is for this reason also that we are \nof the clear opinion that there was no final settlement of the issue \nregarding 1,20,000 sq.ft. of FSI even by the MoU dated 19.1.2005.  If \nthat was so, it is clear that there was live issue in between the parties \nand the parties were at loggerheads on that issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"954540\" id=\"span_2\">30.\tOnce we have come to the conclusion that the learned \nDesignate Judge was right in holding that there was a live issue, the \nquestion of limitation automatically gets resolved. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/954540/\" id=\"a_19\">Hari \nShanker Singhania</a>&#x27;s case (supra) held that till such time as the \nsettlement talks are going on directly or by way of correspondence no \nissue arises and with the result the clock of limitation does not start \nticking.  This Court observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;Where a settlement with or without conciliation is not \npossible, then comes the stage of adjudication by way of \narbitration.  <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 137</a> as construed in this sense, then as \nlong as parties are in dialogue and even the differences \nwould have surfaced it cannot be asserted that a \nlimitation under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 137</a> has commenced.  Such an \ninterpretation will compel the parties to resort to litigation/ \narbitration even where there is serious hope of the parties \nthemselves resolving the issues.  The learned Judges of \nthe High Court, in our view have erred in dismissing the \nappellants&#x27; appeal and affirming the findings of the \nlearned Single Judge to the effect that the application \nmade by the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 20</a> of the Act, 1940 \nasking for a reference was beyond time under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 137</a> \nof the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_24\">Limitation Act</a>\u0005.. As already noticed, the \ncorrespondence between the parties in fact, bears out \nthat every attempt was being made to comply with and \ncarry out the reciprocal obligations spelt out in the \nagreement between the parties.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">These observations would clearly suggest that where the negotiations \nwere still on, there would be no question of starting of the limitation \nperiod.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">31.\tAccording to Shri Salve, learned counsel appearing on behalf of \nthe appellants the clock had started ticking against the respondents in \nrelation to the agreement dated 27.4.1994 and they could have had \nonly three years period for filing a suit as per <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 137</a> of the \n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_26\">Limitation Act</a> and as such the claim made with reference to that \nagreement cannot be arbitrable now in the year 2005.  We do not \nagree.  It is for this reason alone that we have given the complete \nhistory of the negotiations in between the parties.  The things do not \nseem to have settled even by 19.1.2005 but that would be for the \nArbitral Tribunal to decide.  We only observe, at this stage, that the \nclaim of the respondent cannot be said to have become dead firstly \nbecause of the settlement or because of lapse of limitation.  What is \nthe effect of MoU dated 19.1.2005; was the respondent justified in \nrepudiating the said MoU; and what is the effect of repudiation thereof \non the earlier agreement dated 27.4.1994 would be for the Arbitral \nTribunal to decide.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1954535\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1954535/\" id=\"a_27\">Groupe Chimique Tunisien SA vs. Southern \nPetrochemicals Industries Corpn. Ltd.</a> [(2006) 5 SCC 275] this \nCourt had clearly held in para 10 that the Arbitral Tribunal can also go \ninto the question of limitation for the claims in between the parties.  \nWe have discussed this subject only to hold that since the issue in \nbetween the parties is still alive, there would be no question of stifling \nthe arbitration proceedings by holding that the issue has become \ndead by limitation.
