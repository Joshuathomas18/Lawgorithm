To put it in other words, the writ applicant wants that his\nliability of Rs.5,49,14,787/- towards the GST to be adjusted from the\ntotal consideration of Rs.35,99,96,940/-. It is important to note that the\namount of total sale consideration of Rs.35,99,96,940/- is on the basis of\nthe price quoted by the writ applicant himself at the rate of\nRs.1,05,540/- per sq. mtrs. for a plot admeasuring 3411 sq. mtrs. If the\namount of GST is to be included in the total purchase price, then the\nfigure would be much less than at Rs.1,05,000/-.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">20      The second part of the relief is with respect to the forfeiture of the\nEarnest Money Deposit of Rs.35,65,860/-. According to the writ\napplicant, if the relief in terms of para 18 (c), as referred to above, is not\ngranted, then atleast, the AUDA may be directed to refund the amount of\nRs.35,65,860/- towards the Earnest Money Deposit.\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_6\">       SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE WRIT APPLICANT:\n21      Mr. Sukhwani, the learned counsel appearing for the writ\n</pre><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">applicant vehemently submitted that the AUDA is solely responsible for\ncreating unnecessary confusion which has ultimately led to the present\nlitigation. Mr. Sukhwani has a very serious grievance to redress against\nthe AUDA as regards misleading his client on the issue of the liability\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                   Page 9 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                         Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                               JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\ntowards the GST. According to Mr. Sukhwani, the AUDA misled his client\nby saying that there would be no GST liability on the transaction in\nquestion. According to Mr. Sukhwani, his client had to bring it to the\nnotice of the AUDA that he is liable to pay the GST to the tune of\nRs.5,49,14,787/-. According to Mr. Sukhwani, had his client known\nabout his liability towards the GST, he would have offered his price\ntowards the purchase of the plot accordingly. Mr. Sukhwani would\nsubmit that as on date also, his client is ready and willing to deposit\nRs.35,99,96,940/-, but the said amount should be inclusive of the\nliability towards the GST. In other words, according to Mr. Sukhwani, the\namount of Rs.5,49,14,787/- should be deducted from the amount of\nRs.35,99,96,940/- and the AUDA should be asked to accept the balance\namount towards the total purchase price.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">22      Mr. Sukhwani further submitted that if this Court is not inclined to\ngrant the relief, as aforesaid, then, in such circumstances, the AUDA be\ndirected to refund the Earnest Money Deposit to the tune of\nRs.35,65,860/-.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">23      As regards the refund of the Earnest Money Deposit, the\ncontention canvassed by Mr. Sukhwani on behalf of his client is that the\nAUDA has neither pleaded nor proved any loss to the extent of\nRs.35,65,860/- or any part thereof. According to Mr. Sukhwani, if the\nplot is to be re-auctioned as on date, then perhaps, the AUDA may fetch\naround Rs.2 Crore more than the offer made by his client.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">24      Mr. Sukhwani would submit that when the stipulation in the\ncontract is in the nature of securing the parties and on its breach, the\namount deposited (EMD) is forfeited, then such stipulation could be said\nto be in the nature of penalty and not the genuine pre-estimated\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                  Page 10 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                        Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                             JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\ndamages.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">25      It is argued that if the AUDA is permitted to forfeit the EMD of\nRs.35,65,860/-, then the same would amount to unjust enrichment to\nthe AUDA as the AUDA has neither pleaded nor proved any loss to the\nextent of Rs.35,65,860/-.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">26      All the aforesaid submissions of Mr. Sukhwani as regards the\nrefund of the earnest money is based on <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 74</a> of the Contract Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">27      Mr. Sukhwani, in support of his aforenoted submissions, has\nplaced reliance on the following case law:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199138734\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1867094\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158693\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"584252\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"70828540\" id=\"span_25\">[1] <a href=\"/doc/70828540/\" id=\"a_4\">Kailash Nath Associates vs. Delhi Development Authority</a>\n        [2015 (<a href=\"/doc/584252/\" id=\"a_5\">4) SCC 136]\n\n\n        [2] Fateh Chand vs. Balkishan Dass</a> [<a href=\"/doc/158693/\" id=\"a_6\">AIR 1963 SC 1405]\n\n\n        [3] Maula Bux vs. Union of India</a> [AIR 1970 SC 1955]\n\n\n        [4] K.

Prior to the amendment the first\nparagraph of the section read as follows: &quot;When a contract has been\nbroken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in\ncase of such breach, the party complaining of the breach is entitled,\nwhether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused\nthereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract\nreasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">        The Amendment Act came into force on the 1 st of May 1899 and\napplied to &quot;every contract in respect of which any suit is instituted, or\nwhich is put in issue in any suit&quot; after that date. There has been a\nconflict of decisions as to the meaning of these words. They have been\nconstrued on the one hand to comprise two cases, namely, (i) the case of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                     Page 16 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                             Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n     C/SCA/6981/2021                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\nany contract in respect of which any suit may be instituted after the\ncommencement of the Act; and (ii) the case of any contract which is put\nin issue in any suit after the commencement of the Act though the suit\nmay have been instituted before the Act. On the other hand, it has been\nheld that the Act of 1899 only applies to the suits instituted after the\ncommencement of that Act.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">       The section, prior to the amendment, did away with the\ndistinction between a penalty and liquidated damages. The terms of the\nsection were broad enough to include the cases of liquidated damages\nand penalty and a wide discretion was given to the courts in the\nassessment of damages even in cases where the parties to the contract\nhad, in anticipation of the breach, expressly determined by agreement\nwhat should be the sum payable as damages for the breach. The section\nwas introduced to obviate difficulties which existed in distinguishing the\nliquidated damages from penalty in English law; the effect of it was that\nthe courts were not bound to award the entire amount of damages\nagreed upon by the parties in anticipation of the breach. The only\nrestriction was that the court could not decree damages exceeding the\namount previously agreed upon by the parties. Accordingly, a plaintiff\nwas not entitled to recover simpliciter the sum mentioned in the contract\nwhether as penalty or as liquidated damages. He must prove the\ndamages he had suffered and would be entitled to the amount he\nsucceeded in actually proving not exceeding the sum mentioned&quot;. But\nthis simplicity of the law was disturbed by the practice of the courts in\ngiving relief in certain cases by invoking their equitable jurisdiction. The\nAmendment Act was passed with a view to bringing all those cases\nwithin the scope and operation of the section, at the same time\ninterfering as little as possible with its letter and spirit. It is a mistake to\nthink that the section only speaks of agreements that are unreasonable,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                  Page 17 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                          Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n    C/SCA/6981/2021                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\nit speaks of all agreements in which the damages to be paid for the\nbreach of contract are stated as a certain sum of money or are otherwise\nspecified. The effect of such a stipulation is that the damages awarded\ncannot exceed the sum of money or other matters specified, but, on the\nother hand, can exceed the actual damages or loss proved. The section is\nas much applicable to consent decree as to any contracts. With regard to\nthe section the following is the intention of the legislature; (i) the\nplaintiff must prove his damage in a general sense; (ii) the contract\nmade by the parties estimating their damages is in itself evidence; (iii) if\nthere is no other evidence of damage this evidence alone will be\nconsidered sufficient in certain cases; (iv) the sum named is not\nconclusive evidence, i.e., if there be other evidence or circumstances\nshowing that it is excessive, the court will not consider itself bound by it;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">(v) if, on the other hand, the evidence and circumstances indicate that\nthe damage equals or may equal or is likely to exceed the amount\nnamed, the court will abide by it; and (vi) in case where other evidence\nshows that it is unreasonable, the plaintiff will have to prove his\ndamages irrespective of the figure. The section applies only to cases\nwhere the plaintiff omits to prove that he has sustained any actual loss\nor damage at all. Even where the liquidated damages are entered in a\ncontract itself as Payable in the event of breach, then the damages\npayable, when a breach occurs, are to be assessed in the ordinary way\nsubject to the fixed amount as a maximum. It is for the plaintiff to prove\nthe exact amount of damages which he has suffered and that amount\nonly can be awarded&#x27; &#x27;The section applies, as stated therein, when a\ncontract has been broken, if a contract for sale provides for alternative\nmodes whereby a purchaser may pay either by instalments or by a lump\nsum, it may be a question whether there is any breach until the\npurchaser has wholly failed to pay and not merely failed to pay in one\nmode.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                 Page 18 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                        Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">      C/SCA/6981/2021                               JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\n\n        Both <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 73</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_21\">74</a> respectively provide for reasonable\ncompensation, and <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 74</a> contemplates that the maximum\nreasonable compensation may be the amount which may be fixed in the\ncontract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">        <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 74</a> of the Indian Contract Act is clearly an attempt to\neliminate the somewhat elaborate refinements made under the English\ncommon law in distinguishing between the stipulations providing for\npayment of liquidated damages and stipulations in the nature of penalty.\nUnder the common law a genuine pre-estimate of damages by mutual\nagreement is regarded as a stipulation naming liquidated damages and\nbinding between the parties: a stipulation in a contract in terrorem is a\npenalty and the court refuses to enforce it, awarding to the aggrieved\nparty only reasonable compensation. The Indian Legislature has sought\nto cut across the web of rules and presumptions under the English\ncommon law by enacting a uniform principle applicable to all\nstipulations naming amounts to be paid in case of breach, and\nstipulations by way of penalty.&quot; [See : Dutt on contract Fifth Edition].\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">40      Mr. Sukhwani would submit that <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 74</a> applies not only to the\ncases where the aggrieved party is seeking to receive some amount on\nbreach of contract, but also to the cases where upon breach of contract\nan amount received under the contract is sought to be forfeited.

But, on the other hand, if these special circumstances\n        were wholly unknown to the party breaking the contract, he, at the\n        most, could only be supposed to have had in his contemplation the\n        amount of injury which would arise generally, and in the great\n        multitude of cases not affected by any special circumstances, from such\n        a breach of contract. For, had the circumstances been known, the\n        parties might have provided for the breach of contract by special terms\n        as to the damages in that case, thus it would be very unjust to deprive\n        them&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">44      The above principles were explained and clarified by the Court of\nAppeal in Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd vs. Newman Industrial Ltd.,\n1949 (1) ALL ER 997 as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">        &quot;i) it is well settled that the governing purpose of damage is to put the\n        party whose rights have been violated in the same position, so far as\n        money can do it, as if his rights had been observed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">        ii) In cases of breach of contract, the aggrieved party is only entitled to\n        recover such part of the loss as actually resulting as was at time of the\n        contract reasonably foreseeable as liable to result from the breach.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">        iii) What was at that time reasonably to foreseeable depends on the\n        knowledge then possessed by the party who later commits the breach.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">        iv) For this purpose, knowledge possessed is of two kinds one imputed,\n        the other actual. Everyone, as a reasonable person, is taken to know the\n        ordinary course of thing and consequently what loss is liable to result\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                    Page 21 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                            Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\n        from a breach of contract in that ordinary course. This is the subject\n        matter of first rule in Hadley vs. Baxndale. But to this knowledge,\n        which a contract breaker is assumes to possess, whether he actually\n        possesses or not, there may have to be added in a particular case,\n        knowledge which he actually possesses of special circumstances outside\n        the ordinary course of thing of such a kind that a breach on those\n        special circumstances would be liable to cause more loss. Such a case\n        attracts the operation of the second rule so as to make additional loss\n        also recoverable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">        v) In order to make the contract breaker liable under either rule it is not\n        necessary that he should actually have asked himself what loss is liable\n        to result from a breach. As has often been pointed out, parties at the\n        time of contracting contemplate not the breach of the contract, but its\n        performance. It suffices that if he had considered the question, he\n        would as a reasonable man have concluded that the loss in question\n        was liable to result.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">        vi) Nor, finally, to make a particular loss recoverable, need it be proved\n        that upon a given State of knowledge the defendant could as a\n        reasonable man, forces that a breach must necessarily result in that\n        loss. It is enough if he could foresee it was likely so to result. It is\n        indeed enough if the loss for some factor without which it would not\n        have occurred is a serious possibility or a real danger.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"804591\" id=\"span_50\">45      The above principles apply to grant of compensation under\n<a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act. This is clear from the decision of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/804591/\" id=\"a_30\">Karsandas H. Thacker vs. Saran Engineering Co. Ltd.</a>\n[AIR 1965 SC 1981]. The Supreme Court held that when a party\ncommits breach of contract, the other party is entitled to receive\ncompensation for any loss by the damage caused to him which naturally\narose in the usual course of business from such breach or which the\nparties knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from the\nbreach of it. Remote and indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of\nthe breach will not entitle the party complaining breach, to any\ncompensation. Referring to the facts of the case and Illustration (k) to\n<a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act, the Supreme Court held:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                    Page 22 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                            Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">      C/SCA/6981/2021                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\n        &quot;On account of the non-delivery of scrap iron, he could have purchased\n        the scrap iron from the market at the same controlled price and similar\n        incidental charges. This means that he did not stand to pay a higher\n        price than what he was to pay to the respondent and therefore he could\n        not have suffered any loss on account of the breach of contract by the\n        respondent. The actual loss, which, according to the appellant, he\n        suffered on account of the breach of contract by the respondent was the\n        result of his contracting to sell 200 tons of scrap iron for export to the\n        Export Corporation. It may be assumed that, as stated, the market price\n        of scrap iron for export on January 30, 1953, was the price paid by the\n        Export Corporation for the purchase of scrap iron that day. As the\n        parties did not know and could not have known when the contract was\n        made in July 1952 that the scrap iron would be ultimately sold by the\n        appellant to the Export Corporation, the parties could not have known\n        of the likelihood of the loss actually suffered by the appellant, according\n        to him, on account of the failure of the respondent to fulfill the\n        contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">        Illustration (k) to <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act is apt for the purpose\n        of this case. According to that illustration, the person committing\n        breach of contract has to pay to the other party the difference between\n        the contract price of the articles agreed to be sold and the sum paid by\n        the other party for purchasing another article on account of the default\n        of the first party, but the first party has not to pay the compensation\n        which the second party had to pay to third parties as he had not been\n        told at the time of the contract that the second party was making the\n        purchase of the article for delivery to such third parties.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">46      Damages can be awarded only for the loss directly suffered on\naccount of the breach and not for any remote or indirect loss sustained\nby reason of the breach of contract. The general rule is that where two\nparties enter into a contract and one of them commits breach, the other\nparty will be entitled to receive as damages in respect of such breach of\ncontract, such sum as may fairly and reasonably be considered arising\nnaturally, that is according to the usual course of things, from such\nbreach of contract itself or such as may reasonably be supposed to have\nbeen in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the\ncontract, as the probable result of the breach of it.

But, on the other hand, if\nthe special circumstances were not made known to the party breaking\nthe contract, the party breaking the contract, at the most, could only be\nsupposed to have had in its contemplation the amount of injury which\nwould arise generally and directly and not any remote or unknown loss\nor damage.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1961897\" id=\"span_55\">47      What would be a &#x27;penalty&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 74</a> of the Contract Act\nwas explained by the Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/1961897/\" id=\"a_34\">K.

Turning to the law in England we have a series of decisions showing\n        that a deposit by way of earnest in a contract for the sale of land is\n        distinguishable from a penalty for breach of the contract. The cases\n        cited to us by the appellant&#x27;s counsel are all cases in which either an\n        instalment of the price or a part payment was by the terms of the\n        contract to be forfeited on breach by the purchaser. If any authority be\n        needed to show what the law in England is it may be found in the\n        passage in Halsbury, Vol. XXV, p. 398, para 681, which was cited to us\n        by respondents&#x27; counsel. There it is clearly laid down that there is a\n        distinction between a deposit and a penalty. This distinction was\n        referred to by the majority of the Bench in the case of Bishan Chand v.\n        Badha Kishan Das (1897) I.L.R. 19 All. 489, where it was stated that a\n        deposit is a payment actually made or advanced and therefore <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_36\">Sections\n        73</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_37\">74</a> of the Indian Contract Act have no application in such a case\n        and are not intended to apply to it. These sections show what is the\n        compensation to the seller, who is not responsible for the breach. They\n        contemplate a case in which he is seeking to recover compensation for\n        the breach. They do not contemplate a case in which a sum of money\n        has been paid by way of earnest. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"516480\" id=\"span_59\">Nor is the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_38\">Indian Contract Act</a>\n        necessarily exhaustive (see <a href=\"/doc/516480/\" id=\"a_39\">P.

Furthermore, it is to be noted that in this particular contract there\n        was a specific condition of the sale by auction that the deposit was to be\n        forfeited in case of default by the purchaser and we think that such a\n        clause is not unreasonable and must be given effect to. Our own High\n        Court Rules regarding the sale by the Sheriff&#x27;s office (Rule 391)\n        specifically allow a deposit to be forfeited and the mere fact that the\n        word &quot;may&quot; is used in that Rule cannot be taken to mean that only such\n        sum out of the deposit can be forfeited as the Court may think proper as\n        damages following the failure of the buyer to complete the sale.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"584252\" id=\"span_60\">(Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n50      However, subsequently, in <a href=\"/doc/584252/\" id=\"a_40\">Fateh Chand</a> (supra), the Supreme\nCourt while dealing with the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 74</a> of the Contract Act held\nas follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">        &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 74</a> declares the law as to liability upon breach of contract\n        where compensation is by agreement of the parties predetermined, or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                    Page 25 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                            Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                                   JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\n        where there is a stipulation by way of penalty.

Use of the expression &quot;to receive from the party\n        who has broken the contract&quot; does not predicate that the jurisdiction of\n        the court to adjust amounts which have been paid by the party in\n        default cannot be exercised in dealing with the claim of the party\n        complaining of breach of contract. The court has to adjudge in every\n        case reasonable compensation to which the plaintiff is entitled from the\n        defendant on breach of the contract.

After referring to the aforesaid judgements, the Supreme\nCourt concluded as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">        &quot;15. The law is, therefore, clear that to justify the forfeiture of advance\n        money being part of &#x27;earnest money&#x27; the terms of the contract should be\n        clear and explicit. Earnest money is paid or given at the time when the\n        contract is entered into and, as a pledge for its due performance by the\n        depositor to be forfeited in case of non-performance by the depositor.\n        There can be converse situation also that if the seller fails to perform\n        the contract the purchaser can also get double the amount, if it is so\n        stipulated. It is also the law that part-payment of purchase price cannot\n        be forfeited unless it is a guarantee for the due performance of the\n        contract. In other words, if the payment is made only towards part-\n        payment of consideration and not intended as earnest money then the\n        forfeiture clause will not apply.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">54      The difference between an earnest or deposit and an advance part\npayment of price is now well established in law. Earnest is something\ngiven by the Promisee to the Promisor to mark the conclusiveness of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                    Page 27 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                             Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\ncontract. This is quite apart from the price. It may also avail as a part\npayment if the contract goes through. But even so it would not lose its\ncharacter as earnest, if in fact and in truth it was intended as mere\nevidence of the bargain. An advance is a part to be adjusted at the time\nof the final payment. If the Promisee defaults to carry out the contract,\nhe loses the earnest but may recover the part payment leaving\nuntouched the Promisor&#x27;s right to recover damages. Earnest need not be\nmoney but may be some gift or token given. It denotes a thing of value\nusually a coin of the realm given by the Promisor to indicate that the\nbargain is concluded between them and as tangible proof that he means\nbusiness. Vide Howe v. Smith (1884) 27 Ch.D. 89.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">55      The practice of giving earnest is current in the present day\ncommercial contracts. An advance is made and accepted by way of\ndeposit or guarantee for the due performance of the contract. The\ndistinction between a deposit and a part payment is thus described by\nBenjamin on sales at page 946:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">        &quot;A deposit is not recoverable by the buyer, for a deposit is a guarantee\n        that the buyer shall perform his contract and is forfeited on his failure\n        to do so. As regards the recovery of part payments the question must\n        depend upon the terms of the particular contract. If the contract\n        distinguishes between the deposit and instalments of price and the\n        buyer is in default, the deposit is forfeited and that is all. And in\n        ordinary circumstances, unless the contract otherwise provides, the\n        seller, on rescission following the buyer&#x27;s default, becomes liable to\n        repay the part of the part of the price paid.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">56      In Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, third edition, volume XXXIV, page\n118 the distinction between the two is thus pointed out:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">        &quot;Part of the price may be payable as a deposit.

If, on the other hand, the intention\n        was that the money should be deposited as earnest or as a guarantee\n        for the due performance of the payer&#x27;s obligation, the rule at common\n        law is that if the contract is rescinded by reason of his default the\n        deposit is forfeited to the payer and cannot be recovered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">        In the latter case, however, and also where it has been expressly agreed\n        that a part payment shall be forfeited in the event of the payer&#x27;s default,\n        equity is prepared within limits to grant relief against the forfeiture.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">58      The observations of Mellish, L.J., in Ex parte Barrell: In re Parnell\n10 Ch. App. 512 assume importance. His Lordship observed that even\nwhen there is no clause in the contract as to the forfeiture of the deposit\nif the purchaser repudiates the contract, he cannot have back the money\nif it was a deposit, as the contract has gone off through his default. It is\ncharacteristic of a deposit to entail forfeiture if the depositor commits\nbreach of his obligation. On the contrary it is inherent in a part payment\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                    Page 29 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                            Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                                  JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\nof price in advance that it should be returned to the buyer if the sale\ndoes not fructify. The buyer is not disentitled to recover, even if he is the\nparty in breach, because breach of contract on the part of the buyer\nwould only entitle the seller to sue for damages but not to forfeit the\nadvance. A specific forfeiture clause might operate to defeat the buyer&#x27;s\nright of recovery of even an advance payment. But equity might step in\nto relieve the buyer from forfeiture. If the amount forfeited cannot stand\nthe test of a genuine pre-estimate of damages, it would be\nunconscionable for the seller to retain it. The question whether the\namount is a deposit (earnest) or a part payment cannot be determined\nby the presence or absence of a forfeiture clause. Whether the sum in\nquestion is a deposit to ensure due performance of the contract or not is\nnot dependent on the phraseology adopted by the parties or by the\npresence or otherwise of a forfeiture clause. The proportion the amount\nbears to the total sale price, the need to take a deposit intended to act in\nterrorem, the nature of the contract and other circumstances which\ncannot be exhaustively listed have to be taken into account in\nascertaining the true nature of the amount. In essence the question is\none of proper interpretation of the terms of a contract.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">59      We would like to refer to a decision of the Court of Appeal in\nEngland in Stockloser v. Johnson (1954) 1 All. E.R. 630 and particularly\nto the observations of Denning, L.J., which, if we may say so with\nrespect, has set out the legal position succinctly and with great clarity.\nThe facts of that case need not be set out and it would be sufficient to\nrefer only to the principle of law laid down by the Court of Appeal. At\npage 637 Denning L.J., observes thus:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">        &quot;It seems to me that the cases show the law to be this.

Temple\n        112 E.R. 1304, Mayson v. Clouet (1924) A.C. 980, Dies v. British and\n        International Mining and finance Corporation Ltd. (1939) I.K.B. 724\n        and Williams on Vendor and Purchaser fourth ed., Volume 2, page\n        1006. (ii) But when there is a forfeiture clause or the money is\n        expressly paid as a deposit (which is equivalent to a forfeiture clause)\n        then the buyer who is in default cannot recover the money at law at all.\n        He may, however, have a remedy in equity, for, despite the express\n        stipulation in the contract, equity can relieve the buyer from forfeiture\n        of the money and order the seller to repay it on such terms as the Court\n        thinks fit.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">60      Therefore, it is clear that the forfeiture can be justified if the terms\nof the contract are clear and explicit. If it is found that the earnest\nmoney was paid in accordance with the terms of the Tender for the due\nperformance of the contract by the Promisee, the same can be forfeited\nin case of non-performance by him or her.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59682311\" id=\"span_80\">61      Having regard to the terms of contract in the case on hand, more\nparticularly, clause 21(4), the same would implicitly demonstrate that\nthe writ applicant was obliged to deposit 10% amount of the total\nconsideration excluding the EMD for the purchase of the plot within 10\ndays of the Letter of Allotment; failing which the entire amount paid\nearlier by the writ applicant would stand forfeited by the AUDA without\nassuming any liability whatsoever the case may be.

In other cases, where a sum is named in a\n        contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only\n        reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount so\n        stated. Similarly, in cases where the amount fixed is in the nature of\n        penalty, only reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding\n        the penalty so stated. In both cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is\n        the upper limit beyond which the Court cannot grant reasonable\n        compensation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">        2.

Since <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 74</a> awards reasonable compensation for damage or\n        loss caused by a breach of contract, damage or loss caused is a sine qua\n        non for the applicability of the Section.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">        4.

The measure\n           of damages in the case of breach of a stipulation by way of\n           penalty is by <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 74</a> reasonable compensation not exceeding\n           the penalty stipulated for. The Court also observed: (AIR p.\n           1411, para 11)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">           11. It was urged that the section deals in terms with the right to\n           receive from the party who has broken the contract reasonable\n           compensation and not the right to forfeit what has already been\n           received by the party aggrieved. There is however no warrant for\n           the assumption made by some of the High Courts in India, that\n           <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 74</a> applies only to cases where the aggrieved party is\n           seeking to receive some amount on breach of contract and not to\n           cases where upon breach of contract an amount received under\n           the contract is sought to be forfeited. In our judgment the\n           expression the contract contains any other stipulation by way of\n           penalty&#x27; comprehensively applies to every covenant involving a\n           penalty whether it is for payment on breach of contract of money\n           or delivery of property in future, or for forfeiture of right to\n           money or other property already delivered. Duty not to enforce\n           the penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation is\n           statutorily imposed upon courts by <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 74</a>. In all cases,\n           therefore, where there is a stipulation in the nature of penalty\n           for forfeiture of an amount deposited pursuant to the terms of\n           contract which expressly provides for forfeiture, the court has\n           jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers reasonable,\n           but not exceeding the amount specified in the contract as liable\n           to forfeiture. and that,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">           14. ...

In our view, the High Court fell in error in so holding. By\n        invoking the bank guarantee and/or enforcing the bid security, there is\n        no statutory right, exercise of which was being fettered. There is no\n        term in the contract which is contrary to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_110\">Indian\n        Contract Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_111\">The Indian Contract Act</a> merely provides that a person can\n        withdraw his offer before its acceptance. But withdrawal of an offer,\n        before it is accepted, is a completely different aspect from forfeiture of\n        earnest/security money which has been given for a particular purpose.\n        A person may have a right to withdraw his offer but if he has made his\n        offer on a condition that some earnest money will be forfeited for not\n        entering into contract or if some act is not performed, then even though\n        he may have a right to withdraw his offer, he has no right to claim that\n        the earnest/security be returned to him. Forfeiture of such\n        earnest/security, in no way, affects any statutory right under the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_112\">Indian\n        Contract Act</a>. Such earnest/security is given and taken to ensure that a\n        contract comes into existence. It would be an anomalous situation that\n        a person who, by his own conduct, precludes the coming into existence\n        of the contract is then given advantage or benefit of his own wrong by\n        not allowing forfeiture. It must be remembered that, particularly in\n        government contracts, such a term is always included in order to ensure\n        that only a genuine party makes a bid. If such a term was not there\n        even a person who does not have the capacity or a person who has no\n        intention of entering into the contract will make a bid. The whole\n        purpose of such a clause i.e. to see that only genuine bids are received\n        would be lost if forfeiture was not permitted.&quot; [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">69      The aforesaid dictum as laid by the Supreme Court applies with all\nforce having regard to the facts of the present case and the nature of the\ndispute.

According to Mr. Sukhwani, the terms of contract\ncould be said to be subject to the mandatory provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 74</a> of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                    Page 39 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                                            Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                              JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_114\">Contract Act</a>. In other words, according to Mr. Sukhwani, the action\nof the AUDA must be based on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 74</a> of the\nContract Act. Its nature must therefore be determined in the light of the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 74</a> of the Contract Act. We would have appreciated\nsuch argument of Mr. Sukhwani provided the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 74</a> of\nthe Contract Act are regarded as the implied terms of contract. Action\ncontrary to <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 74</a> may then be said to be action which is a breach of\nan implied term of contract, but the meaning of an &quot;implied term&quot; is not\nso wide as to include the provisions of any statute which may apply to\nthe conduct of the contracting parties. Normally &quot;terms will be implied\nwhere they are necessary to effectuate the intention of the parties or\nwhere they are required by statute&quot;. (Sutton and Shammom on\nContracts, 7th Edition page 94). Examples of statutory implied terms may\nbe gathered from the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_119\">Sale of Goods Act</a>. Such terms may either be\nimplied subject to contract to the contrary or may be compulsorily\nimplied notwithstanding the terms of a contract to the contrary. But\n<a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 74</a> of the Contract Act does not purport to modify expressly the\nterms of a contract or to imply terms in a contract. It is generally an\nindependent provision of law under which the Court has power to\ndecide what reasonable compensation may be paid to a party for breach\nof contract whether or not loss is caused to him. Just as <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 73</a> of the\nContract Act is not regarded as an implied term of the contract but is\nrather regarded as the remedy given by law to a person seeking\ncompensation for breach of contract and indicating the amount of\ncompensation which may be so claimed. <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 74</a> is a supplementary\nprovision dealing with penal clauses in contract and statutorily resolving\nthe distinction between the liquidated damages and penalty. Neither any\nprinciple nor authority was brought to our notice why <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 74</a> should\nbe regarded as an implied term of the contract.</p><pre id=\"pre_10\">\n\n\n71      In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a Division Bench decision\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                 Page 40 of 42</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                       Downloaded on : Mon Sep 06 07:46:19 IST 2021</span>\n      C/SCA/6981/2021                                 JUDGMENT DATED: 25/08/2021\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">of the Calcutta High Court in the case of M/s. India Government Mint\nand others vs. M/s. Shreebhumi Steel Pvt Ltd [MAT 359 of 2010 with\nCAN 3276 of 2020 decided on 4 th October 2010], wherein the Court has\nobserved thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">        &quot;So far as the principles relating to implied terms are concerned, the\n        position has been stated in Chitty on Contracts, 28th Edn., Chapter 13\n        which reads as follows :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">        &quot;A term will not, however, thus be implied unless the court is satisfied\n        that both parties would, as reasonable men, have agreed to it had it\n        been suggested to them... the court will only imply a term if it is one\n        which must necessarily have been intended by them, and in particular\n        will be reluctant to make and implication where the parties have\n        entered into a carefully drafted written contract containing detailed\n        terms agreed between them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">        A term ought not to be implied unless it is in all the circumstances\n        equitable and reasonable. But this does not mean that a term will be\n        implied merely because in all the circumstances it would be reasonable\n        to do so or because it would improve the contract or make its carrying\n        out more convenient. &quot;The touchstone is always necessity and not\n        merely reasonableness&quot;...... A term will not be implied if it would be\n        inconsistent with the express wording of the contract.&quot; (emphasis in\n        original).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">72      If we accept the entire case put up on behalf of the writ applicant,\nthen it presupposes that money paid in advance, may it be by way of\nearnest money or may it be in the nature of part satisfaction of the total\nconsideration, is, as a rule, refundable by the Promisor unless it is\nproved and established that he is entitled to certain damages as\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act or to liquidated\ndamages as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 74</a> of the Indian Contract Act or\nunless there is any specific stipulation between the parties as to the\nforfeiture of such money paid in advance. In other words, it assumes that\nas a rule any sum named in a contract as money paid in advance is penal\nand, therefore, hit by <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 74</a> of the Contract Act. We are of the view\nthat either on principle or on law such an assumption is not justified.

In fact, an earnest\nmoney, belonging as it does to a class of its own, namely, that of deposit,\nis regulated and controlled by consideration which are peculiar to that\nclass alone. Therefore, where the agreement is unequivocal and it is\nspecifically agreed upon thereunder that what has been paid in advance\ntowards a contract is nothing but an earnest money, as understood in\nlaw, then it has to be dealt with in the light of the principles which apply\nto such deposits and not in the light of those that generally apply to\nrestitution, penalty or liquidated damages.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">73      We have also looked into all other decisions relied upon by Mr.\nSukhwani including some of the orders of this High Court, however, they\nare of no avail to the writ applicant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">74      For all the foregoing reasons, this writ application fails and is\nhereby rejected.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">                                                      (J.
