It may be mentioned that in the said agreement dated\n10.04.2004, the &quot;National Games Secretariat (NGS), Assam&quot; is referred to as\n&quot;the employer&quot; and the respondent no. 1 is referred to as &quot;the contractor&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">6.

Later on, by a\nletter dated 28.09.2013, the respondent no.1 was informed that the High Power\nCommittee, which was set up for approval of their final bill had rejected the\nclaim as because the works against which the balance amount was due was not\nbacked with formal work order and hence, it could not be considered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">Appointment of Arbitral Tribunal and its decision:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">8.

The learned Arbitral Tribunal had formed an opinion that certain\nqueries regarding final bill which was raised by the proforma respondent no.2\nwas also clarified by the respondent no.1 vide letter dated 01.09.2011 which\nwas accompanied with detailed analysis of the bill in the desired format supplied\nby the proforma respondent no.2. The learned Arbitral Tribunal had referred to\nthe evidence of DW-1 and held that she had admitted that the High Powered\nCommittee in its meeting held on 10.01.2007 had recommended additional work\nof earth filling for Rs.6,25,50,613/- and in that view of the matter, it was held\nthat   the   amount   recommended       by   the   High   Power    Committee     was\nRs.149,63,45,305/-. In light of the letter dated 21.12.2006 (Document no.13),\nthe learned Arbitral Tribunal had observed that the additional work executed by\nthe respondent no.1 was checked by the Assam PWD and that in the said\nprocess, the Service Engineer of the Engineer-in-charge and the respondent\nno.1 was also involved and that the said letter (Document no.13) clearly\ndisclosed that measurement of the additional work was taken by the Engineer-\nin-charge, and had recommended for the acceptance of the quantity of excess\nwork as recorded by them. The learned Arbitral Tribunal had referred to letter\ndated 14.10.2006 (Ext.H) by the Engineer-in-charge to the Commissioner and\n                                                                     Page No.# 10/44\n\nSecretary of the proforma respondent no.2, intimating execution of work for\nvalue of Rs.149,16,17,305/-. The learned Arbitral Tribunal had also referred to\nthe cross-examination of DW-1 wherein she had stated that the additional claim\nwas not rejected due to late submission of bill or delay in execution of project,\nbut the reason ascribed for rejection was not based on any work order and that\nno other reason was attributed for rejection of the additional claim. Accordingly,\nthe learned Arbitral Tribunal had held that Ext. nos. 6 to 11, 13, 14, 19 and the\nadditional documents filed by the respondent no.1 on 28.11.2015 i.e. Ext.A to\nExt.A/17 left no doubt that the respondent no.1 on instructions of the Engineer-\nin-Charge had executed additional work for an amount of Rs.10,39,65,104/-.\nHence, the learned Arbitral Tribunal had held that the respondent no. 1 was\nentitled to relief under <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_4\">section 70</a> of the Contract Act, 1872 as the completed\nworks were duly handed over to the proforma respondent no.2 and that they\nhad utilized the same fully and reaped the benefit of the work. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1327484\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1661027\" id=\"span_2\">In connection\nwith the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_5\">section 70</a> of the Contract Act, 1872, the learned Arbitral\nTribunal had quoted the relevant portion of the case of (<a href=\"/doc/1661027/\" id=\"a_6\">1) Union of India Vs.\nSita Ram Jaiswal</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/1327484/\" id=\"a_7\">1976) 4 SCC 505 , and (2) K.S.

The learned senior counsel for the appellant had referred to all\nthe ground nos. (A) to (AJ) and had submitted that the learned Additional\nDistrict Judge No.1, Kamrup (M), Guwahati (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the\nlearned Court below&quot;) had not appreciated that the respondent no.1 had failed\nto discharge its initial burden to prove the issue of maintainability. It had also\nfailed to appreciate that the claim of respondent no.1 had become barred by\nlimitation much prior to invocation of the arbitration clause and thus, it was\nstated that the claim was not a live claim. It was also stated that the claim for\nadditional work was not willing to scope of the contract agreement and\ntherefore the Arbitral Tribunal had travelled beyond the terms of contract. It was\nfurther submitted that award of pre-reference and pendente lite period could\nnot have been granted owing to specific bar contained in Clause 40.1(g) of the\nSpecial Condition of Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">20.            In respect of issue no. 1, it was submitted that while deciding\nissue no.1, the Arbitral Tribunal proceeded on a wrong premises as the\nrespondent no.1 was bound to prove the existence of the fact and burden of\nproof was on the respondent no.1 and that while deciding the said issue no.1,\nthe learned Arbitral Tribunal did not discuss any evidence of the witness of\nrespondent no.1. It was also projected that it was perverse because the DW-1\nhad taken the plea that the claim as well as Arbitral proceedings was barred by\nlimitation but the finding of the learned Arbitral Tribunal was to the effect that\nthere was no whisper in the statement of DW-1 on the plea and that although\nsuch plea was taken in the statement of the defence, but at the time of\n                                                                      Page No.# 13/44\n\nadducing evidence those were abandoned by the respondent no.2 and in this\nregard reference was made to paragraph 20 of the evidence-in-affidavit by DW-\n1 and it was also stated that there was no cross-examination by the respondent\nno.1 on the said point.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">21.             It was also urged that the CW-1 had stated in his cross-\nexamination that he was not a Director/ Secretary or Principal officer of the\nrespondent no.1 Company and that he had not exhibited any &quot;Board resolution&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">or &quot;Power of Attorney&quot; authorizing him to depose on behalf of respondent no.1\nand that the CW-1 had also admitted that he had not verified the pleadings\nmade in the statement of claims and that he had also not submitted any\ndocument to show that he was associated with the project from 2004 to 2008.\nThus, it was submitted that the statement of claim and that the pleadings was\nnot signed or verified by the Director/ Secretary or Principal officer on behalf of\nthe respondent no.1 Company and the person who had signed the verification\nappended to the statement of claims had not appear before the Arbitral Tribunal\nto give his evidence. Accordingly, it was submitted that CW-1 was not a credible\nwitness and therefore, the learned Arbitral Tribunal ought not to have been\nrelied on his evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">22.             Moreover, it was also urged that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1731368/\" id=\"a_12\">section 19</a> of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the learned Arbitral Tribunal had\ndetermined the rules of procedure and had permitted the parties to adduce\nevidence and therefore, the substantive provision of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_13\">Evidence Act, 1872</a>\nregarding examination of witness was applicable in the instant arbitration\nproceeding. It was also submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_14\">Articles of the Limitation Act, 1963</a>\napplied to the facts situation of the case. Moreover, by referring to the\nstatement made in paragraph 20 of the evidence-on-affidavit by the DW, it was\n                                                                     Page No.# 14/44\n\nstated that the decision of the learned Arbitral Tribunal on issue no.2 was\nperverse and the said issue was decided on the basis of surmises and\nconjunctures and without consideration of the relevant pleadings and evidence\non record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">23.             In respect of issue no.2 it was submitted that the respondent\nno.1 had not submitted its final bill in terms of clause 57.1 of the General\nConditions of the Contract and clause 40.1 (f) of the Special Conditions of\nContract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">24.            It was further stated that the learned Arbitral Tribunal had failed\nto consider that the final bill was submitted on 03.06.2011 after expiry of 3\nyears 3 months 2 days from the date of &quot;defect liability period&quot;, i.e. 30.01.2008.\nThus, it was submitted that as <a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 18</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_16\">Schedule to the Limitation Act</a>\nwas applicable, the claim was barred by limitation. It was further submitted that\nthe learned Arbitral Tribunal had failed to consider that the respondent no.1, in\nthe statement of claim had neither pleaded the date when right to apply for\narbitration had accrued and nor the date when Clause-15 of the Special\nCondition of Contract was invoked had been pleaded. It was also stated that in\nterms of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/686376/\" id=\"a_17\">section 3</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_19\">137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_20\">Schedule\nto the Limitation Act, 1963</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1879468/\" id=\"a_21\">section 43(1)</a> of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, the claims as well as Arbitration proceedings itself were\nbarred by limitation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">25.            In respect of issue no.3 it was submitted that the learned Arbitral\nTribunal had decided the said issue by going beyond the terms of the\nAgreement dated 10.04.2004. Hence, it was submitted that the decision on\nissue no. 3 amounted to a gross misconduct by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and\n                                                                      Page No.# 15/44\n\nit was submitted that the decision on issue no. 3 was without jurisdiction. It was\nsubmitted that strong reliance on the Clauses 38.0 and 38.1 of the Special\nConditions of Contract was one of the main defence taken by the proforma\nrespondent no.2 before the learned Arbitral Tribunal as well as before the\nlearned Court below. However, neither the learned Arbitral Tribunal, nor the\nlearned Court below had referred or discussed the same in their respective\naward/order. It was submitted that there was no material to show that the\ncontract price of Rs.139,45,66,938/- was increased on account of variations\nwithin the provision of the Contract agreement i.e. within the scope of clause\n38.0 and 38.1 of the Special Conditions of Contract. Hence, it was submitted\nthat the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal was beyond the scope of\nthe Deed of Agreement dated 10.04.2004 and it was also submitted that the\npresent dispute was not an arbitrable dispute and the relief, if any, ought to\nhave been claimed elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">26.              It was also submitted that although the High Powered\nCommittee had recommended revised contract value at Rs.149,63,45,305/-, but\nit was not the authority competent to admit any claim. It was submitted that the\ncompetent authority i.e. the proforma respondent no. 2 had neither issued a\nformal work order to the respondent no.1 nor the respondent no. 1 had carried\nout the purported additional work with the prior consent or concurrence of the\nproforma respondent no. 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">27.

Hence,     the    extra   work     of   value   of\nRs.10,38,65,104/- would be about 7.45% of the value of original contract, which\nis far below the cap of 15% permissible variation as provided under clause 38.2.\nHence, it was submitted that there was no requirement for the Engineer in-\ncharge or for the respondent no.1 to obtain prior approval of the employer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">32.

The following points urged by the learned senior counsel for the\nappellant, that are covered by the point of determination no. 1 are as follows,\nviz., (1) the statement of claim was not maintainable; (2) the claim was barred\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 18</a> to the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_51\">Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963</a>; (3) the extra work\npurportedly done by the respondent no.1 was not covered by the agreement\ndated 10.04.2004 containing arbitration clause; (4) interest was granted despite\nthere being a specific bar in the said agreement; and (5) the arbitral proceeding\nwas barred within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 137</a> of the schedule to the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_53\">Limitation\nAct</a>. The said points are discussed as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">         1. Statement of claim was not maintainable: The claim petition was\n         signed and filed by one Shri Sushanta Shah Deo. The evidence-on-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"119004973\" id=\"span_28\">affidavit on behalf of the respondent no.1 was sworn and filed by Shri\n         Dilip Kumar Bera (CW-1). In his cross-examination, the CW-1 had\n         stated that he had not exhibited any Board&#x27;s resolution or power of\n         attorney authorizing Shri Sushanta Shah Deo to file the statement of\n         claim and pleading on behalf of the claimant company. The claim\n         petition, verified on 22.06.2015, does not contain any statement that\n         the person verifying and filing the claim was one of the Directors, or\n         Secretary or Principal Officer of the respondent no.1 Company.\n         Therefore, ex facie the respondent no.1 has not been able to show\n         that the claim petition was filed on the strength of any board resolution\n         or power of attorney or letter of authority, authorizing Shri Sushanta\n         Shah Deo to file the statement of claim before the learned Arbitral\n         Tribunal. From the evidence on affidavit as well as from the cross-\n         examination of Shri Dilip Kumar Bera (CW-1), it is clear that Shri\n                                                             Page No.# 23/44\n\nSushanta Shah Deo, i.e. the person who had filed the claim petition\nwas not examined as a witness. The said point was taken by the\nproforma respondent no. 2 in its written statement of defence.\nHowever, the CW-1 did not prove that Shri Sushanta Shah Deo had the\npower or authority to file the statement of claim on behalf of the\nclaimant company. Thus, the appellant has been able to demonstrate\nthat Shri Sushanta Shah Deo lacked the power and authority to file the\nstatement of claim on behalf of the claimant company. The case of\n<a href=\"/doc/119004973/\" id=\"a_54\">State Bank of Travancore</a> (supra), cited by the learned counsel for the\nappellant supports the said proposition. Therefore, the claim petition\nwas not maintainable. Hence, the finding of the learned Arbitral\nTribunal that the claim petition was maintainable is perverse.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">2.

In this regard, the respondent no.1 has not\n  been able to demonstrate that the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_57\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> was not\n  applicable in the instant arbitral proceeding.

In this regard, the learned senior counsel for the\nappellant has been able to demonstrate that in the statement of\nclaim, there is no statement that the respondent no.1 had made any\nrequest to the proforma respondent no.2 for appointment of\narbitrator or for referring the dispute to arbitration. However, in para\n14 (b) of the rejoinder of the claimant filed on 17.11.2015, a\nstatement has been made that the arbitration clause was invoked\nvide letter dated 09.05.2014 (Ext.N), which was received by the\nproforma respondent no. 2 on 20.05.2014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">            iii.    It would be appropriate to refer to Clauses 55.1,\n56.1 and 57.1 of the Conditions of Contract, as well as Clause\n40.1(f) of the Special Conditions of Contract, which reads as\nfollows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">    55.1 The contractor shall request the Engineer to issue a\n    Certificate of Completion of the works and the Engineer will do\n    so upon deciding that the work is completed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">    56.1 The Employer shall take over the site and the works within\n    seven days of the Engineer issuing a Certificate of Completion.\n    57.1       The Contractor shall supply to the Engineer a detailed\n    account of the total amount that the Contractor considers\n    payable under the Contract before the end of the Defects\n    Liability Period.

If the Final Account\n    is still unsatisfactory after it has been resubmitted, the Engineer\n    shall decide on the amount payable to the Contractor and issue\n    a payment certificate, within 56 days of receiving the\n    Contractor&#x27;s revised account.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">    40.1(f) Final bill shall be submitted by the contractor within 30\n    days from the date of completion and payment shall be made\n    within 90 days on final certification and after completion of all\n    works and on testing/ commissioning/ guarantee.\n    Therefore, on considering the time limit prescribed under clause\n57.1 of the Conditions of Contract read with Clause 40.1(f) of the\nSpecial Conditions of Contract, the defect liability period would\ndefinitely end on 29.01.2010, being calculated from 30.01.2007, the\ndate on which the completed works was handed over to the\nproforma respondent no. 2. This date of 30.01.2007 would be the\nonly possible date relevant to the issue because it is not the pleaded\ncase of the respondent no. 1 that the proforma respondent no. 2\nhad disputed the final accounts. Moreover, out of the agreed\ncontract price of Rs.139,44,66,938/- a sum of Rs.139,45,00,000/-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">(Rupees One hundred thirty nine lakh forty five lakh only) was paid\nto the respondent no. 1, which is evident from the contents of the\nletter dated 03.06.2011 (Ext.I) of the Engineer-in-Charge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">          iv.

Thus, by applying <a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 18</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_64\">Schedule to the\nLimitation Act, 1963</a>, the claim would become barred in three years\n                                                           Page No.# 26/44\n\nfrom the date the work was done, i.e. from 30.01.2007. Thus, the\nperiod of limitation to recover money would end on 29.01.2010.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">          vi.     Under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_66\">Limitation Act, 1963</a>, the\nperiod of limitation would expire in three years from the date when\nthe right to apply accrues. Thus, if the period of limitation is counted\nfrom 30.01.2008, the date when completion certificate was issued,\nthe three year period of limitation would expire on 29.01.2011.\nThus, not only the claim was barred by limitation, but the arbitration\nproceeding must be also held to be barred by limitation because the\nrequest for having the dispute settled by arbitration was issued by\nthe proforma respondent no. 2 on 20.10.2014 (Ext.Q), which is after\nthe limitation to make claim had expired on 29.01.2011.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">         vii.

In this case, the learned Arbitral Tribunal as well as\nthe learned Court below had computed the period of limitation from\n28.09.2013.

Even in the said letter dated 03.06.2011 (Ext.I), the date of bill\nis not mentioned. It has not been shown how the contents of the\nforwarding letter dated 03.06.2011 or the contents of a purported\nbill would constitute the proof of earth-filling work done. As\nmentioned herein before, the request letter dated 09.05.2014\n(Ext.N) by the respondent no. 1 for appointment of arbitrator was\nreceived by the proforma respondent no. 2 on 20.05.2014. Thus, if\nwork was completed and handed over to the proforma respondent\nno. 2 on 30.01.2007, and bill was forwarded on 03.06.2011, the\nclaim cannot be said to be within the period of limitation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">         xii.

Thus, the learned Arbitral Tribunal as well as the\n  learned Court below had committed patent illegality in computing\n  the period of limitation from 28.09.2013, which is contrary to the\n  principles of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_68\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> and thus, contrary to the public\n  policy of the Country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\">3.

The respondent no. 1 has not been able to\n  successfully demonstrate that the extra earth-filling work was within\n  the meaning of variation as envisaged in the scope of the present\n  contract. In this regard, it has already been stated herein before that\n  the respondent no. 1 has not proved any document by which the\n  Engineer-in-Charge had given any direction to the respondent no.1\n  to do any extra earth-filling work. Moreover, there is no pleading or\n  evidence to the effect that the consent of the Employer was taken\n  either by the Engineer-in-Charge to do extra work and/or by the\n  respondent no. 1 before carrying out such extra earth-filling work.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">            ii.

A to A/17 leaves no manner of doubt that the respondent\n  no. 1 on instruction of the Engineer-in-Charge M/s.

The said finding is\n                                                          Page No.# 29/44\n\nperverse because of two factors mentioned below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">    a.     In the evidence-on-affidavit filed by CW-1 on 05.04.2016,\n    the &quot;Bidding Document Package-I&quot; is marked as Exhibit-A. No\n    other document is exhibited as Ext.A/1 to A/17. However, the\n    Arbitration record reveals that vide petition dated 28.11.2015,\n    the respondent no. 1 had prayed for leave under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_69\">Order VII, Rule\n    3 CPC</a> to bring on record certain documents, which were\n    marked as Annexure- A/1 to A/17. There is no statement in the\n    evidence-on-affidavit by CW-1 regarding any document showing\n    scope of work by the Engineer-in-charge. Some parts of the\n    cross-examination of CW-1 are in question and answer form.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">    The relevant question and answer are quoted below:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">    Q.     Can you show the written authority of the Engineer in-\n    charge with the concurrence of the authority for execution of\n    additional work?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">    R.

Moreso, reliance by\nthe learned Arbitral Tribunal on Ext.A/1 to Ext.A/17 is perverse\nbecause the said documents were not exhibited by CW-1 vide\nhis evidence-on- affidavit.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">b.     The purported dues of Rs.10,38,65,104/- is definitely not\nthe value of extra/additional earth-filling work. As per the\ncontents of letter dated 03.06.2011 of the Engineer-in-Charge,\nthe value of work, inclusive of purported extra/additional earth-\nfilling work was Rs.149,83,65,104/-. The payment made was\nRs.139,45,00,000/-. Thus, the payment due was calculated at\nRs.10,38,65,104/-        (Rs.149,83,65,104/-,           less       paid\nRs.139,45,00,000/-).          The        contract       price      was\nRs.139,45,66,938/-. Thus, it is apparent that Rs.66,938/- out of\ncontract   price    of   Rs.139,45,66,938/-         remained    unpaid.\nTherefore, the value of purported extra/additional earth-filling\nwork   must    be   presumed        to   be   Rs.10,38,65,104/-    less\nRs.66,938/- which would be Rs.10,37,98,166/-. Thus, a\nfundamental or elementary mistake has been committed not\nonly by the respondent no. 1, but also by the learned Arbitral\nTribunal and the learned Court below that value of extra work\nwas Rs.10,38,65,104/- by omitting to take into account the\ncontents of letter dated 03.06.2011 (Ext.I) that when payment\nof Rs.139,45,000/- was made, the sum of Rs.66,938/- remained\n                                                                   Page No.# 31/44\n\n     unpaid out of the contract price.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">           iii.         As already indicated herein before, the price of\nearth-filling     was     not   included   within   the   contract     price   of\nRs.139,45,66,938/- as mentioned in the Letter of Acceptance dated\n13.02.2004, issued by the proforma respondent no. 2.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_82\">           iv.          Therefore, as the prior consent of the proforma\nrespondent no. 2 was not taken to carry out any extra work, the\nappellant has been able to successfully demonstrate that the extra\nwork purportedly done by the respondent no. 1 was not covered by\nthe agreement dated 10.04.2004 containing arbitration clause.\nTherefore, such claim was definitely not an arbitrable dispute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">           v.           In this regard, the learned Arbitral Tribunal had\ninvoked the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 70</a> of the Contract Act, 1872, which\nprovides as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">  &quot;70.

A is not entitled to compensation from B, if\n  the circumstances show that he intended to act gratuitously.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_84\">      In this regard, the respondent no. 1 has not been able to\ndemonstrate that under the Contract Agreement dated 10.04.2004\nthere was any clause by which money became payable to the\nrespondent no.1 if they had done any work gratuitously, which was\npurportedly put to beneficial use by the proforma respondent no.2.\nMoreover, it could not be shown that under the arbitration clause,\n                                                          Page No.# 32/44\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal had been conferred with the power and\njurisdiction to pass and/or make an award on the principle of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_71\">Section\n70</a> of the Contract Act, 1872. Therefore, if the respondent no. 1 had\na claim which was within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 70</a> of the Contract\nAct, 1872, the remedy for the respondent no. 1 lied elsewhere and\nnot by way of arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"200767\" id=\"span_29\">vi.

The reason\nfor the same is that as per the contract agreement, and clauses\nunless any work was carried out with prior approval of the &#x27;employer&#x27;\nin writing, there was no scope of carrying out the purported\nadditional/ extra earth-filling work. The said cited case is an\nauthority on the point that even if the agreement containing\narbitration clause is repudiated or the contract has come to an end,\nthe arbitration clause survives. However, as the dispute is not within\nthe arbitration clause, there can of course be no arbitration, but the\nreason for that would not be that the arbitration clause has ceased\nto exist but that the dispute is outside its scope.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"200767\" id=\"span_30\">[see para 30 of the\ncase of Heyman v.

In the said case, the earth work was\ncarried out beyond the lead of 7 kms., and under such\n                                                           Page No.# 33/44\n\ncircumstances, it was held that it was not a case where the\narbitrators had acted beyond the terms of the contract. The factual\nmatrix in the present case in hand is squarely distinguishable\nbecause under the agreement there was a bar to carry out work\nbeyond the scope of the contract without prior written consent of\nthe employer and the contract rate was pre-determined and paid to\nthe respondent no. 1. Therefore, when the agreement did not\ncontemplate any additional or extra work to be done without prior\nconsent of the employer i.e. proforma respondent no. 2 in writing,\nthe Court is of the considered opinion that the principle of quantum\nmeruit, implied contract and/or the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 70</a> of the\nContract Act, 1872 can be invoked in this case in hand.

The learned senior counsel for the respondent no. 1 had further\nsubmitted that the additional/extra work was done under the\ninstructions of the Engineer-in-Charge and that such work was\ncertified by them. Moreover, it was submitted that as per the terms\nof    the original   contract, the Engineer-in-Charge will decide\ncontractual matters between the proforma respondent no. 2 and the\nrespondent no. 1.

In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1617540/\" id=\"a_83\">Delhi Development Authority</a> (supra), the\nrespondent therein had procured stone aggregate from Nooh in\nHaryana and made a claim for extra lead. It was held by the\nSupreme Court of India that there was no material on record to\nsubstantiate the case of the claimant, viz., DDA had insisted upon\nthe claimant for using the stone aggregates brought from Nooh in\n                                                            Page No.# 35/44\n\n  Haryana. On facts it was held that the terms and conditions of the\n  Agreement are binding on both the parties and that in the absence\n  of specific clause with regard to payment of extra cartage and in\n  view of clause 3.16, the claimant cannot claim extra cartage on the\n  ground of extra lead involved in bringing the stone aggregates from\n  Nooh in Haryana. It was further held that the Division Bench like the\n  Arbitrator proceeded on the sole basis that DDA had compelled the\n  claimant-Company from bringing the stone aggregates from Nooh in\n  Haryana and committed an error in affirming the erroneous\n  conclusion arrived at by the Arbitrator insofar as the additional\n  claims are concerned.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">  x. Similar circumstances exist in this case. There is nothing on\n  record to show that the Engineer-In-Charge had issued any written\n  direction to the petitioner to do the work of extra earth-filling. Even\n  assuming that there was a written direction by the Engineer-in-\n  Charge, the said document was not proved and/or exhibited by the\n  CW-1. There is also nothing on record to show that with prior\n  approval in writing by the Employer, i.e. proforma respondent no. 2,\n  such extra earth-filling work was done. Therefore, the inevitable\n  conclusion is that the learned Arbitral Tribunal had erred in allowing\n  claim for work of extra earth-filling, which was beyond the scope of\n  the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">4. Interest was granted despite there being a specific bar in the said\nagreement:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">             i.

Even otherwise, the claim made by the Respondent was also ex facie\n    time barred. It is undisputed that final payments were received latest by\n    the end of March 2003 by the Respondent. That apart, even assuming that\n    a demand could have been made on account of price variation, such\n    demand was made on 8-9-2003. Repeated letters were written thereafter\n    by the Respondent, culminating in a legal notice dated 30-1-2010. Vide the\n    reply notice dated 16-2-2010, it was made clear that such demands had\n    been rejected. Even taking 16-02-2010 as the starting point for limitation\n    on merits, a period of three years having elapsed by February 2013, the\n    claim made on merits is also hopelessly time-barred.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"101272920\" id=\"span_44\">In para 14 above, the various dates have been referred, which\ndiscloses         that      although    the    date    when      payment      of\nRs.139,45,00,000/- was made to the respondent no.1 has not been\n                                                                           Page No.# 39/44\n\n            pleaded by the appellant, but it was paid before letter dated\n            03.06.2011.

Thus, in view of the discussions made herein before, the Court is\ninclined to hold that the finding and decision by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on\nall the three issues framed for trial are perverse, having been rendered either by\nmisreading and/or non-reading of the evidence available on record.

In light of the\ndiscussions above, the Court is inclined to hold that the learned Arbitral Tribunal\nhad passed/ made an award despite the fact that the claim of the respondent\nno. 1 was barred under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 18</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_102\">Schedule to the\nLimitation Act, 1963</a>. It is further held that the arbitration clause was invoked by\nthe respondent no. 1 beyond the prescribed period of limitation. Therefore, as\nthe request of arbitration was invoked after the claim was barred by limitation,\nthe arbitration was invoked beyond the period of limitation envisaged under\nSection 43 read with <a href=\"/doc/138599/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 21</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1993.\nTherefore, the Court is inclined to hold that the learned Arbitral Tribunal\nentertained the claim beyond the period of limitation, and therefore, the award\nis in conflict with the public policy of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">42.

In this case in hand, the additional/ extra work of earth-filling\nwas not included in the contract dated 10.04.2004, The appellant has\nsuccessfully demonstrated that during cross- examination, the CW-1 had\nadmitted that the earth-filling work was done without the employer&#x27;s\nconcurrence in writing because as per CW-1, as the deviation was within\npermissible limit. Moreover, the CW-1 had also not proved any written direction\nby the Engineer-in-Charge to do extra earth-filling as a part of existing contract\ndated 10.04.2004. Thus, the additional/ extra earth-work was clearly outside the\nscope of the contract agreement dated 10.04.2004. Hence, in the considered\nopinion of the Court, the claim for additional/ extra earth-work was not an\narbitrable dispute, but subject to law of limitation, such a claim could have been\nraised elsewhere. Thus, as the learned Arbitral Tribunal had entertained a non-\narbitrable dispute, the award is contrary to the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_110\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a>,\n                                                                         Page No.# 41/44\n\n1996.

As the learned Arbitral Tribunal had awarded interest, though\nunder Clause 40(1)(g) of the Special Conditions of Contract, it was provided that\n&quot;No interest shall be paid for delayed payments&quot;, therefore, the Court is of the\nconsidered opinion that the award of interest is contrary to the public policy of\nthe Country. Moreover, the award of interest is vitiated by patent illegality as it is\ncontrary to the terms of the agreement/ contract dated 10.04.2004 between the\nparties. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_47\">In the said context, the Court finds support from the ratio <a href=\"/doc/1327484/\" id=\"a_111\">laid down by</a>\nthe Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_112\">Associate Builders</a> (supra), cited by\nthe learned senior counsel for the appellant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_103\">45.             The learned Arbitral Tribunal had entertained the claim which\nwas not covered by the scope of the Contract Agreement because the Employer,\ni.e. the proforma respondent no. 2 did not give its prior approval/consent to the\nrespondent no. 1 to carry out the so called extra earth-filling work. Hence, such\na work was ex facie contrary to the provision of Clause 38.1 of the Special\nConditions of Contract. Therefore, the claim was not covered by the Contract\nAgreement dated 10.04.2004 and thus, the claim for extra earth-filling work\ncannot be said to be covered within the meaning of &quot;changes in the quantities&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">as envisaged under Clause 38.0 read with Clause 38.1 of the Special Conditions\nof Contract. On the conjoint reading of the Clause 38.1(a)(b)(c) along with\nClause 39.1, it appears that the additional work done by the respondent no.1\nwas not proved to be in compliance of the said clauses and moreover, the work\ndone by the respondent no.1 did not receive any prior approval of the proforma\nrespondent no.2. Hence, the Court is constrained to hold that the claim for extra\nearth-filling work was expressly excluded from the scope and ambit of the\n                                                                      Page No.# 42/44\n\ncontract agreement dated 10.04.2004 for which the dispute relating to such\nextra earth-filling work was beyond the scope of arbitration agreement. Hence,\nthe entertaining of claim which was beyond the scope of the arbitration\nagreement vitiates the award of the learned Arbitral Tribunal, which is squarely\nin conflict with the public policy of the Country. The claim, if within limitation,\ncould have been made elsewhere. Thus, by entertaining and awarding a time\nbarred claim, the learned Arbitral Tribunal had committed patent illegality, and\nmoreover, the award is contrary to the fundamental public policy of India.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">46.            Moreover, by showing calculations, it has been mentioned in para\n38(3)(ii)(b) above that the claim made for a sum of Rs.10,38,65,104/- could not\nhave been the bill for additional/ extra earth-filling. Therefore, the learned\nArbitral Tribunal as well as the learned Court below, without reading the\ncontents of letter dated 03.06.2011 (Ext.I), presumed that the claim for\nadditional/ extra earth-filling was Rs.10,38,65,104/-, without any basis, without\ntaking into account that the bill of the proforma respondent no. 2 was not even\nexhibited and proved. The reliance on Ext.I to presume the amount mentioned\ntherein was bill amount was contrary to the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_113\">Evidence Act, 1872</a>, as\nExt.I i.e. letter dated 03.06.2011 was neither a piece of primary evidence nor a\nsecondary evidence. Moreover, the author of the said letter was also not\nexamined. Hence, in other words, the learned Arbitral Tribunal as well as the\nlearned Court below, from the contents of the letter dated 03.06.2011 (Ext.I),\nwritten by Engineer-in-Charge, had baselessly and erroneously presumed that\nthe amount of Rs.10,38,65,104/-, mentioned therein was the bill for additional/\nextra earth-filling work, without appreciating that the payment due, as\nmentioned in the said letter was calculated by the Engineer-in-Charge at\nRs.10,38,65,104/- (i.e. Rs.149,83,65,104/-, less paid Rs.139,45,00,000/-).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">                                                                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123878146\" id=\"span_48\">Page No.# 43/44\n\nMoreover, once the parties are allowed to file evidence-on-affidavit and the\nwitnesses are cross-examined, it cannot be said that the principles of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_114\">Evidence\nAct, 1872</a> in so far as &quot;burden of proof&quot; is concerned, would not be followed. It\nwas the respondent no.1 on whom the burden of proof was cast to prove their\nbill together with other cogent evidence like measurement books, vouchers, etc.\nto prove existence of debt, based on documentary evidence. On burden of proof\nin arbitration cases, the Court finds support from the case of <a href=\"/doc/123878146/\" id=\"a_115\">Great Offshore\nLimited v. Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction Company</a>, (2008) 14\nSCC 240 (para-46), where the Supreme Court of India held that &quot; burden to\nprove that a valid contract containing an arbitration clause existed first rested\non the applicant, as it was the applicant that was moving this Court .&quot; Thus, the\naward for a sum of Rs.10,38,65,104/- towards dues and/or value for additional/\nextra earth-work is perverse, and therefore, contrary to the public policy of\nIndia.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">47.             The reliance of the learned Arbitral Tribunal on Ext.A/1 to\nExt.A/17 is perverse because the said documents were not exhibited vide\nevidence-on- affidavit filed by CW-1. Thus, reference to and reliance upon the\ndocuments in the learned Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s judgment and award, which were\nnot proved by the respondent no. 1 in accordance with law is contrary to the\npublic policy of India, being contrary to well established principles of burden of\nproof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">48.
