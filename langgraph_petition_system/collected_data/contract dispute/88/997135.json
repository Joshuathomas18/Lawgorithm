Under clause (11) of the  agreeme\nnt\n\tit  was provided that any dispute arising out of  this\tsa\nle\n\tshall  be  subject  to Kaira  jurisdiction.  Dispute  havi\nng\n\tarisen\tout  of this contract, the Respondent filed  a\tsu\nit\n\tagainst the appellants in the court of Subordinate Judge\nat\n\tSalem  for the recovery of Rs.1,63,240 being the balance\nof\n\tthe  advance in the hands of the appellants and also  for\n a\n\tsum  of\t Rs.2,40,000 towards damages. The  appellants  int\ner\n\talia  took preliminary objection that the Subordinate  Jud\nge\n\tat  Salem had no jurisdiction to entertain the Suit  as\t t\nhe\n\tparties\t by express contract had agreed to confer  exclusi\nve\n\tjurisdiction  in regard to ali disputes arising out  of\t t\nhe\n\tcontract on the civil court at Kaira. The trial court uphe\nld\n\tthe prelimi-\n\t2\n\tnary objection and found that it had, in view of clause (1\n1)\n\tof the contract, no jurisdiction to entertain the&#x27; suit.\nIt\n\taccordingly returned the plaint for presentation before\t t\nhe\n\tproper court.\n\t    The\t Respondent appealed to the High Court\tagainst\t t\nhe\n\torder of the .Subordinate Judge. The High Court allowed\t t\nhe\n\tappeal,\t set aside the Judgment of the trial court,  with\n a\n\tdirection to take the plaint on file and dispose of the su\nit\n\ton merits and on other issues.\n\t    Hence  this\t appeal by the\tappellants.  Dismissing\t t\nhe\n\tappeal, this Court,\n\t    HELD: That an agreement to oust absolutely the jurisdi\nc-\n\ttion  of the court will be unlawful and void  being  again\nst\n\tthe public policy, Ex-dolo malo non oritur actio. [6G]\n\t    The\t jurisdiction of the court in the matter of  a\tco\nn-\n\ttract  will  depend on the situs of the\t contract,  and\t t\nhe\n\tcause of action arising through connecting factors. [7B-C]\n\t    So\tlong  as the parties to a contract do not  oust\t t\nhe\n\tjurisdiction  of all the courts which would  otherwise\tha\nve\n\tjurisdiction to decide the cause of action under the law,\nit\n\tcannot\tbe  said  that the parties have\t by  their  contra\nct\n\tousted the jurisdiction ofthe court. [8G]\n\t    Where  the\tparties to a contract agreed to\t submit\t t\nhe\n\tdisputes arising from it to a particular jurisdiction  whi\nch\n\twould otherwise also be a proper jurisdiction under the la\nw,\n\ttheir  agreement to the extent they agreed not to submit\nto\n\tother  jurisdictions  cannot be said to be void\t as  again\nst\n\tpublic\tpolicy. If on the other hand the  jurisdiction\tth\ney\n\tagree to submit to would not otherwise be proper,  jurisdi\nc-\n\ttion to decide disputes arising out of the contract it\tmu\nst\n\tbe declared void being against public policy. [8H; 9A-B]\n\t    Where  there may be two or more competent  courts  whi\nch\n\tcan entertain a suit consequent upon a part of the cause\nof\n\taction\thaving\tarisen there-within if the  parties  to\t t\nhe\n\tcontract  agreed to vest jurisdiction on one such  court\nto\n\ttry the dispute which might arise as between themselves\t t\nhe\n\tagreement  would  be  valid. If such a\tcontract  is  clea\nr,\n\tunambiguous  and  explicit and not vague, it is not  hit\nby\n\t<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_3\">sections 23</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_4\">28</a> of the Contract Act. This cannot be  unde\nr-\n\tstood as parties contracting against the Statute. Mercanti\nle\n\tLaw and Practice permit such agreements. [11B-C]\n\t3\n\t    Where  such an ouster clause occurs, it is pertinent\nto\n\tsee whether there is ouster of jurisdiction of other court\ns.\n\tWhen the clause is clear, unambiguous and specific  accept\ned\n\tnotions\t of contract would bind the parties and\t unless\t t\nhe\n\tabsence\t of  ad idem can be shown the  other  courts  shou\nld\n\tavoid  exercising jurisdiction. As regards  construction\nof\n\tthe  ouster clause, when words like &#x27;alone&#x27;, &#x27;only&#x27;  &#x27;excl\nu-\n\tsive&#x27;,\tand the like have been used, there may be no  diff\ni-\n\tculty.\tEven  without such words in  appropriate  cases\t t\nhe\n\tmaxim &quot;expressio unius est exclusio alterius&#x27;-expression\nof\n\tone  is the exclusion of another may be applied. What is\nan\n\tappropriate  case shall depend on the facts of the case.\nIn\n\tsuch  a\t case mention of one thing may\timply  exclusion\nof\n\tanother.  Where\t certain jurisdiction is  specified  in\t t\nhe\n\tcontract, an intention to exclude all others from its oper\na-\n\ttion  may in such cases be inferred. It has therefore to\nbe\n\tproperly construed. [12E-G]\n\t&quot;      S.  Manuel Raj &amp; Co. v .J. Muni Lal &amp; Co.,  AIR\t19\n63\n\tGujarat 148; Sri Rajendra Mills v.
