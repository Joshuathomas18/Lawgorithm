Thus APM allocation gas is sold /\nsupplied at APM rates and APM rates is applicable to and available\nfor APM allocation gas.

Hence, it is obvious\nthat supply of APM gas of APM rate is limited to the extent of APM\nallocation made by the erstwhile GLC. Any supply beyond APM\nallocation would have to be made at non-APM rates as determined by\nthe Government. This is only an implementation of the pricing order\ndated 20.6.2005 and, accordingly, needs to be implemented from the\ndate of applicability of that order, viz. 01.07.2005.

It is also contended\nthat variation in terms of the contract and amendment in contract are\nsought to be made unilaterally and that too without any opportunity\nof hearing to the petitioners. It is submitted that contracts are\nsought to be retrospectively amended which is not permissible more so\nwhen the contacts are sought to be amended at the direction of the\ngovernment (respondent No.1) which also is not permissible in view of\nthe terms and condition of the contract. The impugned communication\nand actions are also challenged on the ground that such retrospective\nrecovery is impermissible in law. It is also claimed that\nretrospective recovery is sought to be made by wrong interpretation\nof the circular / letter of respondent No.1 and incorrect\ninterpretation of the pricing order dated 20.6.2005. Learned Senior\nCounsel for the petitioners have also submitted that the demand for\nretrospective recovery of differential price is opposed to public\npolicy and is contrary to the contract executed between the\npetitioners and the respondents. The learned Senior Counsel appearing\nfor the petitioners have further contended that the respondents are\nnot justified in demanding and enforcing market driven price i.e.\nnon-APM price for the additional gas supplied during the period in\nquestion i.e. July, 2005 to March, 2010. It is also submitted that\nthe market driven price can be demanded only in respect of future\nprotection of gas from new fields. The main demand notice as well as\nthe letter / circular dated 9.2.2012 and letter / circular dated\n4.4.2012 are also challenged on the ground that they are arbitrary,\nopposed to the public policy, contrary to the terms of contact and\nbased on the wrong interpretation of the terms of contract as well as\npricing order. In support of the submission that the writ petitions\nare maintainable the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners have\nclaimed that even according to the respondents, the supply of the\ncommodity under the contract is governed and controlled by the\ngovernment and it affects public interest. Learned Senior Counsel for\nthe petitioners have also submitted that it has now become \nimpossible for the petitioners to recover the said additional burden\nfrom consumers or to pass over the said burden to the consumers or to\nincorporate the effect of the additional burden in  the price of\ntheir final product and that, therefore, it is not possible for the\npetitioners to bear the  burden which is sought to be imposed by the\nrespondent for due from July 2005 to March 2010, vide debit notes\nissued in 2012. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners have\nsubmitted that the claim raised by respondent No.2 is, even otherwise\nalso, time barred and even the contract has expired and new contract\nhas been entered into and executed. Therefore, any claim\nparticularly, time barred claim arising from and on account of the\nold contract which has expired cannot be enforced. It is also claimed\nthat before issuing the impugned circular / letter dated 9.2.2010,\nany opportunity of hearing has not been afforded to the petitioners\nthough by said circular / letter retrospective recovery is sought to\nbe made against the petitioners. It is also contended that if the\nadditional gas had not been supplied to the petitioners, the\nrespondent would have been compelled to flare-up said quantity of gas\nand that therefore also the retrospective demand of non-APM price\nfrom the petitioners in respect of such additional supply of gas is\nunjustified. It is submitted that what is inter alia, challenged by\nthe petitioners is the direction given by the respondent No.1\ngovernment and the grievance raised by the petitioners involve public\nlaw element. The petitioners have also relied on communication dated\n30.3.2006 by respondent No.2 whereby respondent No.2 had, according\nto the petitioners, stipulated that additional supply of gas would be\nunder Demand Management Scheme and that the terms and conditions of\nthe gas supply contract shall remain unchanged. The petitioners have\nalso relied on letters dated 5.6.2006, 5.7.2006, 29.9.2007 and\n8.11.2007 issued by respondent No.2. It is also claimed that the\ndemand and action of retrospective charing of non-APM price is beyond\nthe scope of contract and in violation of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_22\">article 19(1)(g)</a> of the\nConstitution of India. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">6.2\nLearned Senior Counsel for the petitioners have placed on the\nfollowing decisions:-\n</p> \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">(1)</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">2008 (3) SCC 440, \n\n \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">(2)</span>\n2009 Suppl SC 1005, \n\n \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">(3)</span>\n2011 (5) SC 697 and \n\n \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">(4)</span>\n1986 (1) SCC 264.\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">6.3\nLearned Counsel appearing for the respondent No.2 has opposed the\ncontention raised by the petitioners. The learned Assistant Solicitor\nGeneral of India for respondent No.1 has opposed the maintainability\nof the petitions and claimed that the petitions are essentially\ndirected against contractual obligation and that therefore petitions\nare not maintainable. The issues related to the contractual terms and\nconditions should not be and cannot be agitated in writ petition,\nhence petitions for such purpose are not maintainable. It is also\ncontended by the respondents that the petitions are against the\nmonetary claim and that therefore also writ petitions are not proper\nremedy and the petitions do not deserve to be entertained. Learned\nAssistant Solicitor General of India has submitted that the terms and\ncondition of the contract provide that any change in price, as\ndecided by government will be binding to the consumer. It is claimed\nthat the petitions involve interpretation of terms and contract and\nfor that purpose writ petitions are not proper and effective remedy\nand such issues should be agitated in proper proceedings under\nordinary civil remedy and not by invoking prerogative writ\njurisdiction. Reliance is placed on clause No.10.1(b) of <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 10</a>\nand Article No.12 of the contract. Learned Assistant Solicitor\nGeneral of India also relied on clause No. 5.6, 10.2, 10.3, 12.1,\n12.4 and 12.6 of the Contract to support and justify the instructions\ngiven by respondent No. 1 and the demand notes raised by respondent\nNo.2. The petitions are also opposed on ground of delay. It is also\ncontended that the dispute involve and require interpretation of\nterms and conditions of the contract  and that therefore writ remedy\ncannot be invoked and such process in writ proceedings is not\npermissible. The petitions are also opposed on the ground that the\ncontract between the parties prescribe that the dispute between the\nparties arising from the contract would be subject to exclusive\njurisdiction of civil court at Delhi and that therefore for want of\nterritorial jurisdiction the subject petition may not be entertained.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">It is also claimed that the petitioners are bound by terms of the\ncontract which include the obligation to pay price as may be fixed by\nrespondent No.2 and respondent No.1 from time to time. The learned\nCounsel for respondent No.2 has submitted that the respondent No.2\nhas raised demand in view of the direction by respondent No.1 which\nare binding to respondent No.2 as well as the petitioners, being the\nconsumers under the contract. It is submitted, inter alia, in light\nof the terms of the contract, that the respondents are entitled to\nrevise the price and the said terms have been consciously accepted\nand are binding to the petitioners and that therefore the petitioners\nare now estopped from opposing and challenging demand in question. On\nthe strength of terms of the contract it is contended that it is\npermissible to the government to issue instruction and direction with\nregard to the supply of gas as well as price of the gas and to revise\nit at any time and such change, by virtue of the terms of the\ncontract, would be binding to the consumers. It is also claimed by\nthe respondents that the petitions do not deserve to be entertained\nin view of the delay and latches. The learned Counsel would contend\nthat the demand notices were raised way back in May 2012 and until\nnow petitioners never challenged the said debit notices and that\ntherefore now the petitioners are not justified and are estopped from\nchallenging the debit notes, more particularly when the respondent\nNo.2 has already invoked letter of credit submitted by petitioners\nunder terms of the contract. It is further submitted that letter of\ncredit have been invoked by respondents on behalf of all petitioners,\nvide letter dated 30.8.2012 and 4.9.2012. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">6.4\nThus, essentially on the ground that the subject matter of the\npetitions is in realm of contract between the parties, the\nrespondents have opposed the petitions whereas the petitioners have\nclaimed that the contract and the dispute between the parties is also\nin the realm of public law and therefore the petitioners are\njustified in invoking provisions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India and preferring present petitions.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">7.\nI have considered the submissions made by learned advocates appearing\nfor the contesting parties and have examined the material available\non record of present petitions.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">8.\tThe\npetitioners are consumers of gas which they require as fuel for their\nmanufacturing units.

Like any\nprivate body or a person, State or its limb or statutory corporation\nare competent to enter into contract with private bodies, companies\nor individuals and such contract may be purely commercial or business\ncontract without having any flavour or colour of statutory contract.\nAll disputes which arise between the parties to such contract, which\nare not statutory contract or which do not give any rise to rights or\nobligation prescribed under statute, may not necessarily involve\npublic law element merely on account of or in view of the fact that\none of the parties to the contract is State or its instrumentality.\nUnless public law element is inherently involved in the dispute or in\nthe case, public law remedy would not be available to the parties at\nthe dispute and for adjudication or resolution of such dispute the\nparties at dispute should take recourse of ordinary civil remedy. Any\nstrait jacket formula cannot be prescribed to determine as to whether\npublic law element is inherently involved in the dispute on hand or\nnot. It has to be decided on case to case basis and in context of the\ndispute, the parties at dispute and the effect of or involvement of\npublic interest in such dispute and such other factors. Merely\nbecause relatively more number of persons are involved in or affected\nby the dispute or merely because one of the parties to the dispute is\nState or its limb, the dispute will not automatically be treated as\ndispute with public law element.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">10.6\nIn present petitions, on perusal and examination of the contract, it\nemerges that the contracts between the petitioners and respondent\nNo.2 are purely commercial - business contracts which have been\nentered into for sale and supply of gas as per the terms incorporated\nin the contract.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">10.7\nIn this context, it is also relevant to note that the petitioners\nare,  at-the-best a sub-class of consumers out of a class / category\nof consumers viz. industrial consumer inasmuch as respondent No.2 is\nselling/supplying gas to different categories and class of industrial\nconsumers. The said industrial consumers comprise sub-class of\nconsumers whose daily contracted quantity is restricted upto 0.05\nMMSCMD under APM allocation. By the impugned action of respondent\nNo.2 only said sub-class of consumers is affected. Furthermore the\nsaid consumers i.e. petitioners are engaged in commercial activities\nand are using gas as fuel in their manufacturing activity.

The\ninterpretation and implementation of a clause in a contract cannot be\nthe subject-matter of a writ petition.\nWhether the contract envisages actual payment or not is a question of\nconstruction of contract?  If\na term of a contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the\nwrit petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 226.</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">We are also unable to agree with the observations of the High Court\nthat the contractor was seeking enforcement of a statutory contract.\nA contract would not become statutory simply because it is for\nconstruction of a public utility and it has been awarded by a\nstatutory body. We are also unable to agree with the observation of\nthe High Court that since the obligations imposed by the contract on\nthe contracting parties come within the purview of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_72\">Contract Act</a>,\nthat would not make the contract statutory. Clearly, the High Court\nfell into an error in coming to the conclusion that the contract in\nquestion was statutory in nature.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">11.\n\tA statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a statutory\nbody to enter into contracts in order to enable it to discharge its\nfunctions. Dispute arising out of the terms of such contracts or\nalleged breaches have to be settled by the ordinary principles of law\nof contract. The fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a\nstatutory or public body will not of itself affect the principles to\nbe applied.  The\ndisputes about the meaning of a covenant in a contract or its\nenforceability have to be determined according to the usual\nprinciples of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_73\">Contract Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">Every act of a statutory body need not necessarily involve an\nexercise of statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private parties,\nhave power to contract or deal with property.  Such\nactivities may not raise any issue of public law.\nIn the present case, it has not been shown how the contract is\nstatutory.  The\ncontract between the parties is in the realm of private law.\nIt is not a statutory contract.  The\ndisputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of\nsuch a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for\nadjudication by a civil Court\nor in arbitration if provided for in the contract.  Whether\nany amount is due and if so, how much and refusal of the appellant to\npay it is justified or not, are not the matters which could have been\nagitated and decided in a writ petition.\nThe contractor should have\nbeen relegated to other remedies.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">12..................&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1248759\" id=\"span_23\">(emphasis supplied)\n \n\n\tIn\ndecision in case of <a href=\"/doc/1248759/\" id=\"a_75\">N.T.

As observed by the Apex\nCourt, &#x27;the  disputes about meaning of covenant in contract or\nits enforceability have to be determined according to the usual\nprinciples of <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_101\">Contract Act</a>&#x27;.\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">15.\nIt is clarified that since the Court is of the view that having\nregard to the nature  and scope of the dispute and controversy raised\nin the petition, writ remedy is not available and the petitions do\nnot deserve to be entertained the Court has not entered into merits\nof, and has not expressed any opinion as regards, the contentions\nraised by the petitioners and/or meaning and scope or effect of the\nterms of contract and / or about explanation tendered by the\nrespondents including the contentions with reference to the specific\nterms of contract e.g. provisions contained under Articles 5 and/or\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">10 and/or 12, etc, lest the observations may affect the proceedings\nbefore the appropriate forum and / or they may be construed as\nopinion of the Court.  \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">16.\nIt is also clarified that the observations made in present order with\nreference to the aspects related to the contract and/or respective\nrights/objections are only prima facie observations made for the\npurpose of present order and will not stand in way of the petitions\nin appropriate proceedings which may be taken out by the present\npetitioners. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_132\">17.\nOn overall consideration of the facts of the case,  the nature and\nscope of the dispute and controversy as well as the rival claims and\ncontentions and on examination of the terms of contract/s, it emerges\nthat the petitions also involve monetary claim and the contracts\nbetween the parties are governed by private law since the contracts\nare commercial contracts in contradistinction to statutory contracts\nand that, therefore, also the invocation of writ jurisdiction for\nsuch dispute and controversy is not justified and is not available.\nTherefore, the Court is not inclined to entertain the petitions.   \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">18.\tIn\nview of the above discussions and for the foregoing discussions and\nreasons, the Court is of the view that in the facts of the case on\nhand the petitions do not deserve to be entertained and the\npetitioners are required to be relegated to ordinary civil remedy\ninstead of permitting them to invoke prerogative and discretionary\nwrit jurisdiction. Therefore, the petitions are not accepted and\nentertained. Accordingly the petitions are disposed of. Notices are\ndischarged. In the facts of the case there shall be no order of cost.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">19.\nIn view of the total number of matters on the daily cause list, the\ndictation of the order could be undertaken only during twilight hours\nof court working. Therefore, the dictation had to be continued on\n20.9.2012, 24.9.2012, 25.9.2012 and it would be concluded on\n26.9.2012 (on 21.9.2012 the petitions could not be taken up for\ndictation of this order).\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">(K.M.THAKER,J.)\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSuresh*\n\n\n\n</p>","numcites":45,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Gujarat High Court","citetid":184094345,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"statutory contract what is","formInput":"statutory%20contract%20what%20is"},{"value":"interpretations of contracts ","formInput":"interpretations%20of%20contracts%20"},{"value":" breach of contracts","formInput":"%20breach%20of%20contracts"},{"value":"e contracts","formInput":"e%20contracts"},{"value":"terms of contract breach","formInput":"terms%20of%20contract%20breach"},{"value":"civil remedy","formInput":"civil%20remedy"},{"value":"public law element","formInput":"public%20law%20element"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"public law remedy","formInput":"public%20law%20remedy"},{"value":"Interpretation of terms of contract","formInput":"Interpretation%20of%20terms%20of%20contract"},{"value":"letter of credit","formInput":"letter%20of%20credit"},{"value":"contractual obligations","formInput":"contractual%20obligations"},{"value":"rights of seller","formInput":"rights%20of%20seller"},{"value":"enforce the contract","formInput":"enforce%20the%20contract"},{"value":"STATUTORY BODY","formInput":"STATUTORY%20BODY"},{"value":"commercial contract","formInput":"commercial%20contract"},{"value":"43 (a)  filter:  bihar pension rules 1950","formInput":"43%20%28a%29%20%20filter%3A%20%20bihar%20pension%20rules%201950"},{"value":"writ jurisdiction discretionary","formInput":"writ%20jurisdiction%20discretionary"},{"value":"mandamus","formInput":"mandamus"},{"value":"contract law","formInput":"contract%20law"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"citizenship-of-india","formInput":"tag:citizenship-of-india"},{"value":"contract","formInput":"tag:contract"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
