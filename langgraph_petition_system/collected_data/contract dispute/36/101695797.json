These are objections filed under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;) read with <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_3\">13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_4\">16</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1347069/\" id=\"a_5\">18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1943211/\" id=\"a_6\">28(3)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1769118/\" id=\"a_7\">31</a> of the Act by the petitioner-National Thermal Power Corporation (for short\n\n\n&#x27;NTPC&#x27;) against the Awards of the Arbitral Tribunal dated 13th September, 1999 and\n\n\n25th June, 2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">2.    The disputes between the parties arose from a lump sum contract for 4 Cooling\n\nTowers of reinforced cement concrete 120 Metres high along with RCC basin for\n collection of cooled water and arrangement of RCC channels and AC Pipes provided\n\nhorizontally for sprinkling of hot water through nozzles over layers of PVC serrated\n\nsheets, for the purpose of cooling of hot water from 43 Degree C. to 32 Degree C.\n\nthrough natural draft created in the towers. However, the supply of hot water and\n\ndistribution of cold water from the basin was outside the scope of the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">3.    The contract, inter-alia, provided for foreign collaborators and their design for\n\nstructural and thermal attributes of the Cooling Towers, for supply of cement and steel\n\nfree of cost by NTPC, for variation in the quantity of such cement and steel on certain\n\nprescribed consideration and for recovery from the contractor for excess consumption of\n\ncement and steel, for price adjustment of materials, labour and fuel linked with price\n\nindices, for foreign exchange rate protection and other usual conditions found in\n\nbuilding and engineering contracts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4.    A completion schedule was stipulated for making ready the cooling towers. A\n\nschedule was also fixed for carrying out the trial operation within a specific period fixed\n\nseparately for each tower and completion of miscellaneous works was fixed after two\n\nweeks thereafter. A Performance Guarantee (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;PG&#x27;) test\n\nwas also one of such terms. A provision was made in the contract for Bank Guarantee\n for 10% of the contract sum for non-recoverable initial advance and 5% progressive\n\npayment for the stages of trial run and commissioning. The validity period for the\n\nvarious guarantees was stipulated in the contract. The performance guarantee was to be\n\nvalid till the expiry of the guarantee period of one year after trial operation and 90 days\n\nthereafter. The guarantee for initial advance was to be valid till 90 days after trial\n\noperation, and that for progressive payments for trial run and commissioning till after\n\ncompletion of the PG Test. A further provision in the contract provided that the cooling\n\ntowers were to be taken over by NTPC after completion of all the tests. Provisions were\n\nalso made for force majeure and extension of time. Levy of liquidated damages for\n\ndelay in completion as well as in shortfall in achieving the stipulated temperature of 32\n\nDegree C. was also prescribed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.    The case of the respondent/claimant set up before the Arbitrator was that: -\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">a.    The bid of the respondent contractor M/s. Wig Brothers (Builders &amp; Engineers)\n\n\nLimited was accepted by NTPC on 07th November, 1988 for the lump sum of\n\nRs.13,63,22,750.00. A performance guarantee bond was submitted by the contractor as\n\nper the contract requirement valid for a stipulated period of one year after trial operation\n\n\n+ 90 days and keeping to the initial prescribed schedule this bond was valid up to 30th\n June, 1993 as specifically mentioned in the letter of award of the contract.\n\n\nb.    The last of the four cooling towers was handed over to NTPC on 10th July, 1995.\n\n\nApparently, on 25th July, 1996 the respondent-contractor submitted its pre-final bill for\n\n\nan amount of Rs.26,05,21,598. NTPC, by its letter dated 9th August, 1996 denied\n\npayment of the said bill and that resulted in a dispute between the parties. NTPC once\n\nagain communicated its refusal to clear the pre-final bill to the Respondent by letter\n\n\ndated 16th August, 1996.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\nc.    The respondent by its letter dated 11th November, 1997 invoked the arbitration\n\nclause and since, according to the respondent, no Engineer had been appointed by the\n\npetitioner in terms of Clause 3 of the Contract, the respondent called upon the petitioner\n\nto appoint its Arbitrator within 60 days from the receipt of the said notice. The\n\nrespondent also made a request to the President of the Institute of Engineers to appoint\n\nthe third Arbitrator in terms of the Arbitration Agreement contained in the Contract. By\n\nthe said letter the respondent made it clear that the reference of disputes to arbitration\n\nwas not confined to those contained in pre-final bill.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\nd.    The petitioner by its letter dated 29th December, 1997 informed the respondent\n that its letter dated 16th August, 1996 was a decision of the Engineer appointed under\n\nthe Contract and since more than 30 days had lapsed from such date the decision of the\n\nEngineer had become final and binding and there was no dispute which could be\n\nreferred for arbitration in terms of the Contract. The petitioner thus declined to appoint\n\nits nominee arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\ne.    The respondent by its letter dated 9th January, 1998 disputed the stand taken by\n\nthe petitioner and once again called upon the petitioner to appoint the arbitrator. By a\n\n\nseparate letter dated 9th January, 1998 the respondent appointed Shri A.P. Paracer,\n\nAdditional Director General (Retd.), CPWD as its nominee arbitrator and once again\n\nrequested the petitioner and the President, Institution of Engineers to appoint their\n\nnominee arbitrators.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">f.    The President, Institution of Engineers appointed Shri P.P. Dharwadker, Former\n\nChairman and Managing Director, NBCC as the third arbitrator. Since, the petitioner\n\nhad not appointed its nominee arbitrator, even after the expiry of 150 days, the\n\n\nrespondent by its letter dated 31st March, 1998 requested the President of the Institution\n\nof Engineers to nominate an arbitrator on behalf of the Petitioner in accordance with the\n arbitration agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\ng.    The Petitioner by its letter dated 13th April, 1998 claimed, that while it had no\n\nobjection for the appointment of arbitrator on the request of the respondent as contained\n\n\nin its letter dated 31st March, 1998, it was objecting to the appointment of arbitrator on\n\nthe ground that there was no arbitrable dispute as the decision of the Engineer had\n\nbecome final.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">h.    On the request of the respondent, the President of the Institution of Engineers by\n\n\nhis letter dated 6th May, 1998 appointed Shri Balbir Singh, Former Director General,\n\nCPWD as the nominee arbitrator on behalf of the petitioner.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\ni.    On 10th June, 1998 the petitioner filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_9\">13</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (&#x27;the Act&#x27;) before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nchallenging its constitution on several grounds. The Arbitral Tribunal rejected the said\n\n\napplication on 18th August, 1998. The petitioner challenged the said decision of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal before this Court under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> of the Act. That challenge was also\n\n\ndismissed on 17th September, 2001. A further appeal to the Division Bench of this\n\n\nCourt was also dismissed on 18th January, 2002. Thereafter, the Petitioner participated\n in the proceedings of the Arbitral Tribunal, under protest.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.    It appears that at the 6th hearing of the Arbitral Tribunal held on 3rd February,\n\n1999, the petitioner again questioned the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal averring\n\nas under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">              &quot;i.    If claims (Part-I) were a dispute, they were first required to be referred\n\n              to the Engineer and only thereafter the arbitration clause could be invoked.\n\n              Since there was no dispute regarding claims (Part-I) and arbitration was\n\n              never sought on these claims, there could be no reference for arbitration. In\n\n              the absence of any reference the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate in\n\n              respect of these claims.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\n              ii.    The reference commenced only on 11th November, 1997 and this was\n\n\n              clear from the Claimants&#x27; letter dated 11th November, 1997 invoking\n\n              arbitration clause in respect of disputes resulting from the non-acceptance of\n\n              the pre-final bill by the NTPC. This reference made no mention of release\n\n              of Bank Guarantees and consequently claims were beyond the jurisdiction of\n\n              the Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">              iii)   The issues regarding release of Bank Guarantees to be adjudicated\n               upon by the Tribunal are the same as those pending before the Court. The\n\n              matter was, therefore, sub-judice and the Tribunal had no authority to\n\n              proceed with the same.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">7.    By its order dated 13th September, 1999 the Arbitral Tribunal rejected the said\n\nobjections.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">8.    On 25th June, 2002 the Arbitral Tribunal rendered a unanimous Award awarding\n\nthe Respondent a sum of Rs.4,75,41,411/-. The Arbitral Tribunal observed that in case\n\nthe net amount awarded is paid within 30 days of the Award no future interest would be\n\npayable but if the petitioner failed to do so, the net amount awarded shall carry an\n\ninterest of 18% per annum up to the date of actual payment by the petitioner. The\n\nArbitral Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.6,36,450/- in favour of the Petitioner. However,\n\nhaving regard to the fact that the Petitioner had already taken a credit of Rs.3,76,950/- in\n\nthe final bill and the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal reduced the final bill by a sum of\n\nRs.2,00,000/- only a sum of Rs.59,500/- was awarded to the petitioner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">9.    The petitioner questioned the said award under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> of the Act on several\n\ngrounds. The award has been challenged separately under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1137274/\" id=\"a_13\">13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_14\">16</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1347069/\" id=\"a_15\">18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1943211/\" id=\"a_16\">28(3)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1769118/\" id=\"a_17\">31</a> of the Act. However, finally the petitioner&#x27;s Senior counsel, Sh. R.P. Bhat raised\n the following as the main grounds of challenge: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">a.    The appointment and constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal was illegal as it was not\n\nin accordance with the agreement between the parties;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">b.    The PG Test was not done by the respondent which entitled the petitioner to\n\ndeduct a sum of Rs.65,00,000/-. It was immaterial as to why the PG Test was not done.\n\nThe conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal that an adjustment of Rs.6,00,000/- is to be\n\ngiven for non-conductance of the PG Test is without any basis;\n\nc.    The Arbitral Tribunal has awarded claims forming part of the pre-final bill even\n\nthough some of them had not been included and claimed in the final bill; and\n\n\nd.    In the meetings held between the parties on 10th September, 1993, 13th\n\n\nSeptember, 1993 and 28th September, 1993, certain disputes had been settled and the\n\nparties had agreed that no claim would be made by either of them in respect of such\n\ndisputes. Despite this the respondent made a claim in respect of those disputes that had\n\nbeen settled and the Arbitral Tribunal has wrongly adjudicated and allowed such claims\n\nof the respondent.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">10.   In proceedings to adjudicate the challenge to the award under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 34</a>, the\n\nCourt has to bear in mind that it does not sit as a appeal court that has the jurisdiction to\n revisit the evidence and the arguments advanced before the arbitrator and then substitute\n\nits own views with those of the arbitrators. The Court will not set aside a decision of an\n\nArbitral Tribunal merely for the reason that had it heard the matter in the first instance it\n\nwould have come to a different conclusion or that the view it would have taken could\n\nhave been a better view. So long as the view of the Arbitral Tribunal is a plausible view,\n\nthe court will not interfere with the Award merely because it feels that the view of the\n\ncourt may have been different than the one taken by the Arbitral Tribunal. The\n\njurisdiction of this Court is confined to the four corners of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_19\">Arbitration Act</a>, in\n\nparticular the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 34</a>, for determining whether an Arbitration Award is\n\nliable to be set aside or not. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1299750\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"93918\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"799168\" id=\"span_3\">In this respect reference may be made, inter alia to the law\n\nlaid down in the following decisions: - (<a href=\"/doc/799168/\" id=\"a_21\">i) (1987) 4 SCC 497 - [Municipal Corporation\n\nof Delhi vs. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar &amp; Anr.</a>]; (<a href=\"/doc/93918/\" id=\"a_22\">ii) 2002 (97) DLT 902 - [DDA vs.\n\nSahdev Brothers &amp; Anr.</a>]; (iii) 2006 (1) AD Delhi 431 - [Union of India vs. Suchita\n\nSteels (India); (<a href=\"/doc/1299750/\" id=\"a_23\">iv) 2004 (8) AD Delhi 1 - [Devika Mehra vs. Ameeta Mehra</a>].</span></span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"919241\" id=\"span_4\">11.   It is true that an Arbitral Award that is opposed to the public policy of India will\n\nbe liable to be set aside as held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/919241/\" id=\"a_24\">Oil &amp;\n\nNatural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs. Saw Pipes Ltd.</a> 2003(5) SCC 705.</span> Relying upon\n <a href=\"/doc/919241/\" id=\"a_25\">the said judgment</a> of the Supreme Court, a Division Bench of this Court has in the case\n\nof Gian Chand Totu vs. Subhash Chand Kathuria delivered in FAO(OS) No. 1 of\n\n2004 held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                &quot;In our view, the pivotal principle laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                -------- while defining the scope for interference with awards on the grounds of\n                public policy is that the award can be set aside if it is patently illegal but the\n                illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the illegalities are of trivial\n                nature it cannot be held that the award is against public policy. It was further\n                held the award can also be set aside if it was so unfair and unreasonable so as to\n                shock the conscience of the Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                                                         (emphasis supplied)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">12.   This Court, therefore, is required to assess the challenge made by the petitioner on\n\nthe touchstone of the legal position enumerated above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">13.   The case as set up by the petitioner with respect to challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections 11</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_27\">16</a> is as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">           i.          The challenge to the Award under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_29\">16</a> is founded on\n\nthe ground that since the conditions precedent for the appointment of arbitrators had not\n\nbeen fulfilled, the Institution of Engineers did not have the power or authority under the\n\nContract to proceed with the appointment of any arbitrator let alone the nominee\n\narbitrator on behalf of the Petitioner as also the third arbitrator. According to the\n\npetitioner, in order that a dispute could be referred to arbitration, the Contract\n contemplated that at first the dispute would have to be referred to an &quot;Engineer&quot; in terms\n\nof clause 26 of the Contract. That once the Engineer rendered his decision it would\n\nbecome final and binding unless it was questioned by the party aggrieved by carrying\n\nthe dispute to arbitration in terms of clause 27 of the Contract. In substance the\n\npetitioner questions the award on the ground that the composition of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal was not in accordance with the agreement between the parties.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">          ii.      In support of its contentions the petitioner submitted that in this case\n\nthe respondent had lodged its claim with the Engineer that was rejected by the Engineer\n\n\nby his letter dated 16th August, 1996. The said decision of the Engineer became final\n\nand binding between the parties since, the respondent did not initiate arbitration within\n\nthe period of 30 days contemplated by clause 27 of the Contract. That once the period\n\nof 30 days stipulated in clause 27 of the contract had expired, the respondent lost its\n\nright to seek reference of the dispute to arbitration. According to the petitioner, once the\n\nstipulated period had expired there remained no arbitrable dispute between the parties\n\nthat could be referred to arbitration. That in these circumstances when the respondent\n\nitself had lost the right to commence arbitration, the Institution of Engineers could not\n\nproceed to appoint arbitrators at the behest of the respondent/claimant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">         iii.       Clauses 26 and 27 of the Contract in question read as under: -\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;26. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTE\n\n\n\n\n26.1 Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Contract all disputes concerning\nquestions of fact arising under the Contract in the first instance shall be decided by the\nengineer, whose decision shall be final to the parties hereto.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">26.2 Any dispute or difference including those considered as such by only one of the\nparties arising out of or in connection with the Contract shall be to the extent possible\nsettled amicably between the parties.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">26.3 If amicable settlement cannot be reached then all disputed issues shall be settled\nby arbitration as provided in clause 27 below.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">27.

If either of the parties fails to appoint its arbitrator within 60 (sixty)\ndays after receipt of a notice from the other party invoking the Arbitration clause, the\nPresident of the Institution of Engineers, India shall have the power at the request of\neither of the parties, to appoint the arbitrator.

In the alternative the petitioner further submitted that, if, as per the\n\ncase set up by the respondent, the petitioner had not appointed an Engineer in terms of\n\nclause 3 of the contract, it was incumbent upon them to first call upon the petitioner to\n appoint the Engineer and thereafter refer the dispute to him. That in the absence of the\n\nrespondent having followed that procedure, the dispute could not be referred to\n\narbitration directly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">14.   In response to this plea, counsel for the respondent firstly submitted that the\n\ncontention of the petitioner that the respondent had made a claim before the engineer is\n\nfactually incorrect because the petitioner had never appointed an Engineer in accordance\n\nwith the contract and no such contractual entity existed in fact. According to the\n\nrespondent, it had submitted its pre-final bill to the petitioner (and not to the Engineer)\n\n\non 25th July, 1996 and it was that pre-final bill that was rejected by the petitioner by its\n\n\nletter of 9th August, 1996 as also by the letter of 16th August, 1996. The respondent\n\nfurther submitted that if the petitioner itself had failed and/or refused to appoint an\n\nEngineer in terms of the Contract, it was no part of the respondent&#x27;s duty to persuade the\n\npetitioner to appoint one so that the respondent could then refer their dispute to him.\n\nThe respondent submitted that since there was no Engineer nominated by the petitioner,\n\nthe respondent was well within its right within the contract to refer their dispute directly\n\nto the arbitrators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\"> 15.   A perusal of the letter of 9th August, 1996 shows that it is a letter written by the\n\nPetitioner&#x27;s officer, one Mr. A.K. Saxena, Manager (Township) which simply says &quot;On\n\nour scrutiny, it has been observed that the bill in question is not tenable as per contract&quot;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">16.   There is, however, a second letter of 16th August, 1996 that the petitioner claims\n\nwas the decision of the Engineer under clause 26 of the Contract. It is noteworthy that\n\n\nthe letter of 16th August, 1996, though signed by a different person, is in fact a repetition\n\n\nof the letter of 9th August, 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">17.   The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that under no circumstance\n\n\ncould the letter dated 16th August, 1996 be regarded as a decision of the Engineer for the\n\nfollowing reasons: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">a.    No engineer in terms of clause 3 of the Contract had ever been appointed in\n\nwriting and no intimation of such appointment had ever been given to the respondent;\n\n\nb.    The letter dated 16th August, 1996 was nothing but a mere reproduction of the\n\n\npetitioner&#x27;s letter dated 9th August, 1996 which contained neither any discussion nor any\n\nreasons as to why the claimant&#x27;s pre-final was being rejected as &#x27;not tenable&#x27;;\n\n\nc.    The letter dated 16th August, 1996, gave no indication whatsoever that it was a\n decision of the Engineer. The gentleman who signed the letter, one Mr. Nikhil Kumar,\n\nsigned it in his capacity as &quot;MGR. CCD/INF&quot; and the letter is written on the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nletterhead. The expression &quot;Engineer&quot; is significantly absent from the said letter.\n\nd.    That in order for the Engineer to render his decision, the dispute should have been\n\nreferred to him to enable him to invite respective submissions of the parties and apply\n\nhis mind thereto. Since, no reference of any dispute had been made to the Engineer\n\n\n(since none had been appointed), the plea of the said letter dated 16th August, 1996\n\nbeing his decision cannot be accepted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\ne.    That in fact even the petitioner had admitted that the letters dated 9th August, 1996\n\n\nand 16th August, 1996 were really the decisions of the petitioner and not of the\n\nEngineer. In this connection the respondent placed reliance on the petitioner&#x27;s letter\n\n\ndated 9th January, 1998 wherein the petitioner had stated, &quot;Regarding your pre-final bill\n\namounting the same had already been examined/checked by us. On our scrutiny it was\n\nfound that the bill in question is not tenable and the same was to be conveyed to M/s\n\nWig Bros vide our letter ref. no. 08/NCPP/TW/853 dt.9.8.96 and 08/NCPP/INF/10761\n\ndt. 16.8.96.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\"> 18.   The counsel for the respondent further contended that since no Engineer had ever\n\nbeen appointed by the Petitioner, the respondent had no option but to initiate arbitration\n\ndirectly. The respondent submitted that in these circumstances the limitation of 30 days\n\nprovided by clause 27 of the contract was of no consequence inasmuch as there being no\n\ndecision of the Engineer, there was no starting point for such a limitation. In the\n\nalternative, the learned counsel further contended that limitations such as the one\n\nprovided in clause 27 of the Contract would be void in terms of <a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 28(b)</a> of the\n\nContract Act. In this regard the respondent placed reliance on two judgments of this\n\nCourt i.e. M/s. Hindustan Construction Corporation v/s. Delhi Development\n\nAuthority - reported as - 1999 (77) DLT 165 and M/s. Naresh Kumar Gupta vs. The\n\nVice Chairman/Engineer Member DDA &amp; Ors. - reported as - 2003 (2) AD Delhi 628.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">19.   In the circumstances, the respondent submitted that the refusal of the petitioner to\n\nappoint an arbitrator was contrary to the procedure agreed to in the contract and the\n\nInstitution of Engineers was well within its authority not only to appoint the nominee\n\narbitrator on behalf of the petitioner (since, despite opportunity they failed to appoint\n\none) but also to appoint the third arbitrator. Thus, the respondent submitted that the\n\ncomposition of the Arbitral Tribunal was entirely in accordance with the agreed\n procedure and the Institution of Engineers committed no error as averred by the\n\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">20.   The Arbitral Tribunal held that the petitioner produced no evidence to establish\n\nthat they had appointed an Engineer in writing under clause 3 of the Contract. Since\n\nthere was no Engineer formally appointed under clause 3.4 of the Contract there was no\n\nquestion of referring disputes to the Engineer. The Arbitral Tribunal was also of the\n\n\nview that the letter dated 16th August, 1996 was a rejection of the respondent&#x27;s bill by\n\nthe petitioner itself and could not be termed as the Engineer&#x27;s decision on the disputes.\n\nThat in the absence of an existence of an Engineer in terms of the Contract and there\n\n\nbeing no Engineer&#x27;s decision, the rejection by the petitioner by its letter dated 16th\n\nAugust, 1996 had no relevance for reckoning any limitation period for invoking\n\narbitration. This in my view is a finding of fact not amenable to challenge under Section\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">34. Even otherwise I am satisfied that the conclusions of the arbitral tribunal are\n\ncorrect. In fact, the counsel for the petitioner was unable to point out any order\n\nappointing the Engineer contemplated by clause 27. All that is pointed out are two\n\n\nletters dated 9th and 16th August, 1996 and these letters did not even claim to be on\n behalf of the Engineer and thus, it could not be said that any Engineer as per clause had\n\nbeen appointed by the petitioner. The only reference to an Engineer is in the letter dated\n\n\n29th December, 2007 averring for the first time that the letter dated 16th August, 1996\n\nwas, in fact, an Engineer&#x27;s letter as per clauses 26 and 27. Significantly, this was well\n\n\nafter the invocation of arbitration by the respondent on 11th November, 2007 and thus,\n\nis of no avail to the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">21.    The Arbitral Tribunal was further of the view that even assuming that the letter\n\n\ndated 16th August 1996 constituted a decision of the Engineer, the limitation of 30 days\n\nimposed by clause 27 of the contract was void in view of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 28</a> of the Contract\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">22.    In my opinion the petitioner&#x27;s challenge to the award under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_34\">16</a> of\n\nthe Act must fail. I find no infirmity with the reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal on this\n\naccount. In my opinion, in view of the clear finding of fact that the petitioner never\n\nappointed any Engineer in terms of clause 3.4 of the Contract, the question of the letter\n\n\ndated 16th August, 1996 being regarded as a decision of the Engineer under clause 26 of\n\nthe Contract cannot and does not arise. The fact that there was no Engineer also\n supports the respondent&#x27;s contention that no dispute was ever referred to the Engineer\n\nfor his decision. Facts on record in fact clearly reveal that the respondent had only\n\nsubmitted its pre-final bill (as distinct from submission of a claim) to the petitioner\n\n\nwhich was rejected by the petitioner twice i.e. once by the letter of 9th August, 1996 and\n\n\nthen by its letter dated 16th August, 1996. The process of decision making, to say the\n\nleast, involves some inter-action between the decision-making authority and the parties\n\nto the dispute. In the present case, neither was the respondent ever invited to make a\n\nclaim and nor did it submit any to the non-existent Engineer and nor was there any\n\ninteraction between the petitioner, the respondent and the alleged Engineer. I also agree\n\nwith the view of the Arbitral Tribunal that the stipulation of 30 days contained in clause\n\n26 of the contract was contrary to<a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_35\"> S.28(1)</a> of the Indian Contract Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1291574\" id=\"span_5\">23.   That being the case, the respondent had no choice but to directly take its dispute to\n\narbitration. In these circumstances, the limitation of 30 days provided by clause 27\n\n\ncannot be reckoned from the letter dated 16th August, 1996. While I am in respectful\n\nagreement with the judgments of this court cited by the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent namely, M/s. <a href=\"/doc/1291574/\" id=\"a_36\">Hindustan Construction Corporation vs. Delhi Development\n Authority</a> - reported as - 1999 (77) DLT 165 and M/s. Naresh Kumar Gupta vs. The\n\nVice Chairman/Engineer Member DDA &amp; Ors. - reported as - 2003 (2) AD Delhi 628,\n\nI am of the view that as no Engineer contemplated by clause 26 had been appointed, it is\n\nunnecessary to consider this finding or the applicability of the above decisions.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">24.    However, the fact of the matter is that there was no Engineer appointed by the\n\npetitioner and therefore, the question of first inviting his decision and then taking the\n\ndispute to arbitration did not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">25.    Consequently, where an arbitration clause contemplates that a dispute should first\n\nbe referred to an Engineer for his decision, and it is only thereafter, it can be carried to\n\narbitration, what is the recourse open to a contractor for resolution of its disputes if the\n\nowner does not appoint an Engineer which it is obliged to do under the Contract? This\n\nquestion came up for decision of this Court in the case of M/s. Petron Civil\n\nEngineering Limited vs. M/s. DLF Industries &amp; Ors. reported in 2000 (II) RAJ 438\n\n(Del.) in which this Court held: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">&quot;if it&#x27;s the contention of the respondents that the matter had to be first referred to the &quot;Engineer&quot; for\ndecision, it was obligatory on their part to have such a person continue to be appointed so as to have the\nmatter referred to him for decision. That having not been done, there was no need of the matter being\nfirst referred to a person who was not even in existence at the relevant time for his decision.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">&quot;...because there was no &quot;Engineer-in-charge&quot; or &quot;Engineer&quot; available at site to whom the matter\n could be referred for decision, the disputes are required to be referred to an arbitrator...&quot;\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">26.    I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed in the said case. This case\n\nalso supports the further proposition that it was not the duty or the obligation of the\n\nrespondent to have written to the petitioner to appoint an Engineer. If, as the\n\nrespondents contend, that the dispute had to be first referred to an Engineer, it was\n\nobligatory on the petitioner&#x27;s part to have appointed such a person. The petitioner was\n\nalso required to, but did not, communicate any such appointment to the respondent prior\n\n\nto 29th December, 2007. That not having been done there was no need for the dispute\n\nto be first referred to a non-existent entity. I am also of the opinion that one party to an\n\narbitration agreement cannot by his own act or omission prevent the other from having\n\nits disputes resolved by arbitration. The fact is that the parties had entered into an\n\narbitration agreement that contemplated one step to be resorted by the parties before\n\ncarrying the dispute to arbitration. That step was that the Engineer (to be appointed by\n\nthe petitioner) would first try to resolve the disputes between the parties. Now, if the\n\npetitioner fails/refuses or neglects to appoint an Engineer it cannot be heard to contend\n\nthat the arbitration agreement itself is frustrated and that the respondent cannot resort to\n arbitration directly. The intention of the parties was to have their disputes resolved\n\neventually by arbitration. In the absence of the availability of the Engineer, the rest of\n\nthe agreement must be given effect to, as that would be consistent with the intention of\n\nthe parties. This interpretation is in accordance with the well accepted principle of\n\ninterpretation of documents that the intention of the parties, to the extent possible, must\n\nbe given effect to and each and every term of the contract must be implemented. The\n\ncontention of the petitioner would mean that they by their own act would render the\n\nwhole of clause 27 of the contract nugatory and meaningless. Such a contention is\n\ncompletely unacceptable. The intention of the parties was clearly to seek the resolution\n\nof disputes by arbitration though through the route (as per clause 26) of the Engineer.\n\nHowever, the non-appointment of an Engineer by the petitioner could in no manner\n\nundo the intent in the agreement to resolve disputes by arbitration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">27.   I may also notice that the contention of the petitioner that if there was no Engineer\n\nappointed by the petitioner it was incumbent on the Respondent to have one appointed\n\nby the Petitioner, is a self contradictory plea inasmuch their stand and the sheet anchor\n\n\nof their challenge is that there was an Engineer and that the 16th August 1995 letter was\n\na decision of the Engineer. It is apparent that in its desire to prevent the Respondent\n from making its claim the petitioner came up with the plea of treating the 16th August\n\n1995 letter as a &quot;decision&quot; of the &quot;Engineer&quot;, even though it wasn&#x27;t one, and thereafter,\n\nfaced with the situation that they had actually not appointed an Engineer in terms of\n\nclause 3 of the Contract, the Petitioner, as an after thought, came up with the plea that if\n\nsuch was the case then, the Respondent ought to have requested for the appointment of\n\nan Engineer. The issue as to whether an Engineer had been appointed or not is a\n\nquestion of fact and not one of law. The Arbitral Tribunal has given a categorical\n\nfinding of fact that no Engineer had been appointed. It is not open to this Court to\n\nreappreciate that finding of fact. I, therefore, reiterate my finding that in such\n\ncircumstances, reference of the dispute directly to arbitration was perfectly valid and\n\nlegal and I am in complete agreement with the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal on this\n\nissue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">28.      In response to the contention of the Petitioner that since it had taken a stand before\n\nthe Institution of Engineers that there was no arbitrable dispute, they had no authority to\n\nappoint any arbitrator, leave alone two (one as the presiding arbitrator and the other as\n\nthe Petitioner&#x27;s nominee arbitrator), learned counsel for the respondent contended as\n\nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\"> a.   The arbitration agreement contained the entire mechanism for the\n\nappointment of the arbitrators. One arbitrator each was to be appointed by the\n\nPetitioner and the Respondent and the third/presiding arbitrator was to be\n\nappointed by the President, Institution of Engineers. In the event of either the\n\nPetitioner or the respondent failing to appoint its nominee arbitrator, within 60\n\ndays from the date of the request by the other part, the arbitration agreement\n\nitself provided that the nominee arbitrator on behalf of such defaulting party\n\nwas also to be appointed by the President, Institution of Engineers;\n\nb.   The President, Institution of Engineers was only an appointing authority.\n\nHe had only to appoint the arbitrators in terms of the arbitration agreement and\n\nhad no further role to play. The Petitioner, despite the Respondent&#x27;s request\n\n\ndated 11th November, 1997, did not appoint the arbitrator within 60 days and\n\n\ntill as late as 31st March, 1998. Therefore, in terms of the arbitration\n\nagreement, the Petitioner had lost its right to appoint its nominee arbitrator.\n\nFollowing the procedure prescribed in the arbitration agreement, the\n\n\nRespondent by its letter dated 31st March, 1998 requested the President,\n            Institution of Engineers to appoint the 2nd Arbitrator on behalf of the\n\n\n           petitioner. The petitioner had also admitted in its letter dated 11/13th April,\n\n\n           1998 that the President, Institution of Engineers had the right to appoint the 2nd\n\n           Arbitrator on behalf of the Petitioner. The President, Institution of Engineers\n\n\n           had to appoint the 3rd or the presiding arbitrator and the arbitrator on behalf of\n\n           the party who had failed to appoint its arbitrator. It was not for him to decide\n\n           the question of the existence of the disputes. The existence or otherwise\n\n           maintainability of the disputes was to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n           under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration Act;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">           c.    That since the arbitration agreement itself provided a complete\n\n           mechanism for the appointment of the arbitrators; there was no need for the\n\n           Respondent to approach the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration &amp;\n\n           Conciliation Act, 1996 for such appointments. He relied upon <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 11(6)</a> of\n\n           the Arbitration Act in support of his plea.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">29.    <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Arbitration Act provides, thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;(6) Where, under an appointment procedure agreed upon by the parties,-\n\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">a.    A party fails to act as required under that procedure; or\n b.    The parties, or the two appointment arbitrators, fail to reach an agreement expected of them under\nthat procedure; or\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">c.   A person, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to him or it under that\nprocedure,\n\n\n\n\na party may request the Chief Justice or any person or institution designated by him to take the\nnecessary measure, unless the agreement on the appointment procedure provides other means for\nsecuring the appointment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">30.    In the present case, the arbitration agreement provided that in the event of either\n\nparty, i.e. the Petitioner or the Respondent, failing to appoint its nominee arbitrator\n\nwithin 60 days from being called upon to do so, by the other party, the nominee\n\narbitrator on behalf of such party shall be appointed by the President, Institution of\n\n\nEngineers. The Petitioner also admits this. The Petitioner, in its letter dated 11/13th\n\nApril, 1998 admits that the President, Institution of Engineers could appoint the\n\n\narbitrator as requested by the Respondent, in its letter dated 31st March 1998 but it could\n\nnot do so as there were no disputes. The Petitioner thus did not object to the power but\n\nonly objected to the exercise thereof. The Respondent could have approached this Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act only, if the President, Institution of Engineers\n\nfailed to appoint the arbitrator. Since, the President, Institution of Engineers appointed\n the 3rd Arbitrator as also the nominee arbitrator on behalf of the Petitioner, in terms of\n\nthe arbitration agreement, the occasion for the Respondent to approach this Court did not\n\narise. In fact, the Respondent could not have approached this Court under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 11</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration Act unless it had requested the President, Institution of Engineers to\n\nappoint the arbitrator, and such request had been declined or not acted upon.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">31.   The President, Institution of Engineers was only an appointing authority. He was\n\nnot vested with any power to adjudicate the existence of the disputes. In the plain\n\nlanguage of the arbitration agreement, the occasion for him to exercise the power of\n\n\nappointing the 3rd arbitrator was a request from either party; and for the 2nd Arbitrator it\n\nwas the failure on the part of either party to appoint its nominee arbitrator within 60 days\n\n\nfrom being called upon by the other party to appoint its arbitrator. He appointed the 3rd\n\nArbitrator on the request of the Respondent and, since the petitioner failed to appoint its\n\nnominee arbitrator within 60 days from being called upon to do so by the Respondent,\n\nhe appointed the nominee arbitrator on behalf of the Petitioner also. It is settled law,\n\nwhich needs no reiteration that, an appointing authority, which is not a Court, is not to\n\nperform any adjudicatory functions. It has but one role and that is to make the\n appointment and all contentious issues, including those in respect of the existence of\n\ndisputes, have to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration\n\nAct. Therefore, the contention of the Petitioner that the Institution of Engineers ought\n\nnot to have appointed the arbitrators is rejected. The view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n\nin their order dated 18th August, 1998 that the President, Institution of Engineers was\n\nnot required to consider the merits of the respective claims at the time of appointing the\n\narbitrators and that the arbitrators were appointed in accordance with the arbitration\n\nagreement, is in my opinion the correct view and requires no interference from this\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">32.   The appointment of the Arbitral Tribunal was thus legal, valid and in terms of the\n\nagreement between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">33.   The learned senior counsel Mr. R.P. Bhat on behalf of the petitioner, has\n\ncontended that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act when the Arbitrators were\n\napproached for their appointment, they were required to disclose in writing that no\n\ncircumstances existed that were likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to their\n\nindependence or impartiality. That since, the arbitrators did not make any such\n\ndeclaration, the Award deserves to be set-aside under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_46\">13</a> of the\n Arbitration Act. He further submits that the Arbitrators acted with a bias against the\n\npetitioner as it had challenged the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. It is submitted\n\nby Mr. Bhat that the Arbitral Tribunal, since it directed the release of the Bank\n\nGuarantees, acted with malice towards the petitioner and the proceedings, if perused,\n\nwould show that the Arbitral Tribunal acted with bias against the petitioner and the\n\npetitioner was not given a fair hearing and treatment. According to the petitioner it was\n\nmeted out unjust, and improper treatment and that the bias of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nagainst it can be inferred from the fact that as against the claims of the Petitioner\n\namounting to Rs.44 crores only a sum of Rs.59,000/- was awarded in its favour. It is\n\nalso submitted that the proceedings if perused do not reflect the correct state of affairs as\n\nan unfair advantage was given to the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">34.   The petitioner has also questioned the submission of statement of claim by the\n\nrespondent in two parts. It is also submitted on behalf of the petitioner that the arbitral\n\ntribunal proceeded on the basis that the claims of the respondent nomenclatured as\n\n&quot;Part-I Undisputed Claims&quot; were undisputed, which showed legal bias on their part.\n\nThe whole approach, according to the petitioner, of the Arbitral Tribunal was erroneous\n\nin law, patently illegal and contrary to well known principles in law. The Arbitral\n Tribunal, as submitted by Mr. Bhat Ld. Senior Counsel, did not follow any set\n\nprocedures and recorded only those facts, which were convenient to the respondent or to\n\nthem and deliberately omitted the submissions, statements and contentions of the\n\npetitioner. This, according to him has resulted in gross miscarriage of justice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">35.    Mr. P.V. Kapur, learned Senior Counsel, on behalf of the respondent has\n\nsubmitted that the respondent had filed its statement of facts/claims and for the sake of\n\nconvenience, the respondent had divided the statement of facts into two parts i.e. Part-I\n\nand Part-II, and filed them separately. The basis for dividing the statements of facts/the\n\nclaims into two parts was as follows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(i)    Those claims payment for which was to be made by the petitioner to the\n\nrespondent strictly in terms of the contract for the work done by the respondent and\n\naccepted by the petitioner without any dispute were nomenclatured as Part-I of the\n\nstatement of facts or undisputed claims, as according to the respondent there should not\n\nhave been any dispute about the said claims and which also included the bank\n\nguarantees;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(ii)   Part-II of the statement of facts/claim consisted of those claims of the respondent\n\nin respect of extra items/work etc. that the respondent had to carry out for the\n completion of the contract and the loss/damage that the respondent had to suffer on\n\naccount of non-cooperation by the petitioner, the delay caused by the petitioner due to\n\nsuch non-cooperation and the breaches committed by the petitioner; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(iii)    Since, the respondent was praying for the passing of an interim award in respect\n\nof the claims which were the subject matter of Part-I, it wanted that the claims in Part-I,\n\nshould be adjudicated first and therefore the same were submitted in two parts.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">        The Arbitral Tribunal, however, did not pass separate awards but it passed a\n\ncomposite award in respect of both Part-I and Part-II claims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">36.     The respondent had by its letter dated 31st August, 1998 submitted the statement\n\n\nof facts in respect of Part I of its claims and on 26th October, 1998 the respondent\n\nsubmitted the statement of facts in respect of Part II of its claim. Reply was filed by the\n\n\npetitioner on 30th December, 1998, separately to Part I and Part II. Therefore, when the\n\npetitioner filed its reply both Part I and Part II of the statement of facts had already been\n\nfiled by the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_51\">37.     Mr. P.V. Kapur, the learned counsel for the respondent further submitted as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\"> a.    That there was/is no prohibition in law in submitting the statement of claim in two\n\nparts and none has been averred by the petitioner. Furthermore, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/710617/\" id=\"a_47\">Section\n\n19(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act, the Arbitral Tribunal was at liberty to conduct the\n\nproceedings in such manner as it deemed appropriate, without being bound by strict\n\nrules of procedure. Neither before the Arbitral Tribunal nor before this Hon&#x27;ble Court,\n\ndid the petitioner ever allege that any prejudice was caused to it on account of\n\nsubmission of the claim in two parts by the respondent. Further, the allegation of the\n\npetitioner that the Arbitral Tribunal considered those claims of the respondent in part-I,\n\nnomenclatured as &quot;undisputed&quot; as undisputed and proceeded to pass an award as if the\n\nsame were undisputed is totally misconceived, because the Arbitral Tribunal has passed\n\na reasoned Award in respect of all the claims, including those which were filed as part-I,\n\nafter considering the evidence and hearing the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">b.    That an Arbitral award can be challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_48\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_49\">13</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act only if such a challenge had first been made before the Arbitral\n\nTribunal. He submits that thus the petitioner became aware of the constitution of the\n\n\nArbitral Tribunal on 6th May, 1998. The petitioner had 15 days, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_50\">Section\n\n13(2)</a> of the Arbitration Act to challenge the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal but the\n petitioner filed the application under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act only on 10th june,\n\n1998 i.e. after 35 days. He submits that there was a waiver by the petitioner under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1242720/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 4</a> of the Arbitration Act, of its right to raise a challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 12</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act and further, in view of <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 13 (2)</a> of the Arbitration Act, the\n\npetitioner could not have challenged the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal after the\n\nexpiry of 15 days after becoming aware of its constitution. The Arbitral Award,\n\naccording to him, cannot therefore be challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration\n\nAct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">c.     That besides making allegations the petitioner has not set out any circumstances\n\nby which it can be shown that the Arbitral tribunal acted in a biased manner. He submits\n\nthat not all claims of the respondent were allowed and not all claims of the petitioner\n\nwere rejected, and merely because the claims of the respondent were allowed and those\n\nof the petitioner rejected does not by itself constitute bias or is indicative thereof. He\n\nfurther submits that the submission of the petitioner that the arbitrators when they were\n\napproached, were required to disclose in writing that there are no circumstances which\n\nare likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to their independence is contrary to the\n\nplain language of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act. According to him, a disclosure is\n required to be made or given by the Arbitral Tribunal only when there exist grounds,\n\nwhich can give rise to justifiable doubts about the independence or impartiality of the\n\narbitrators. In other words, if no such grounds exist no disclosure is required.\n\nd.    That a challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act can be made only on the\n\ngrounds mentioned in the said section and on no other grounds. This is clear from the\n\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 12(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act. The petitioner, according to him, in its\n\nbelated and time barred application under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act, raised the\n\nfollowing grounds: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">a.    The manner that the Arbitral Tribunal has been constituted gives rise to justifiable\n\ndoubts about its impartiality;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">b.    None of the arbitrators had disclosed in writing the requisite circumstances as to\n\ntheir independence and impartiality.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">c.    The composition of the Arbitral Tribunal and the procedure followed in its\n\ncomposition is not in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     That these are not grounds on which the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal can\n\nbe questioned under <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 12(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act. Therefore, he submits that the\n\napplication made by the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act, was rightly\n rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal, by its order dated 18th August, 1998. He further\n\nsubmits, that the petitioner before this Court cannot urge the grounds which had not\n\nbeen first raised before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">38.    The relevant sections of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_62\">Arbitration Act</a> are as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">&quot;4. Waiver of right to object.--A party who knows that--\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">             (a)       any provision of this Part from which the parties may derogate, or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">             (b)       any requirement under the arbitration agreement,\n\nhas not been complied with and yet proceeds with the arbitration without stating his objection to such\nnon-compliance without undue delay or, if a time-limit is provided for stating that objection, within\nthat period of time, shall be deemed to have waived his right to so object.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">12.

In my view, the petitioner became aware of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal\n\n\non 6th May 1998 or soon thereafter, but in any event before 19th May 1998 when the\n\nPetitioner wrote to the President, Institution of Engineers stating that the appointment of\n\n\nall the three arbitrtaors was illegal and incorrect. The petitioner sent a letter dated 10th\n\nJune 1998 to the Arbitral Tribunal, which the petitioner has stated were the objections\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_65\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_66\">13</a> of the Arbitration Act. Clearly,the said objections were filed\n after the expiry of more than 15 days, from the date when the petitioner became aware\n\nof the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Since, the petitioner had not filed the\n\nobjections within 15 days from the date of becoming aware of the constitution of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal, the petitioner had in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1242720/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 4</a> of the Arbitration Act waived\n\nits right to file the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">40.   I am also unable to agree with the submission of Mr. Bhat that when the\n\narbitrators were appointed they had to disclose in writing that no grounds exist that\n\nwould give rise to justifiable doubts about their independence or impartiality. <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_68\">Section\n\n12 (1)</a> of the Arbitration Act provides that disclosure has to be given by the arbitrators\n\nonly if there exist grounds which would give rise to justifiable doubts about his\n\nindependence or impartiality. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_69\">The Arbitration Act</a> does not provide that when no such\n\nground exists, the arbitrator has to give a written declaration in the negative that no such\n\ngrounds exist. The interpretation suggested by Mr. Bhat would amount to rewriting\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 12</a> and cannot be accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">41.   <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 12(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act sets out the grounds on which a challenge can\n\nbe made to the arbitrator or the Arbitral Tribunal. Under <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 12(3)</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act, a challenge can be made only if one or both of the two grounds set out\n in the said section has been fulfilled. In the application filed by the petitioner, before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal, under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_73\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_74\">13</a> of the Arbitration Act, the grounds raised by\n\nthe petitioner were that it had justifiable doubts about the independence of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal in view of the manner in which it was constituted. The words &quot;justifiable\n\ndoubts as to the independence or impartiality&quot; in themselves do not confer any right. A\n\nmere reproduction of the said words does not give rise to any justifiable doubts about the\n\nindependence or impartiality of the Arbitral Tribunal, but such bias or partiality has to\n\nbe shown from the records with reference to specific instances. This Court is unable to\n\ncomprehend as to how can the manner, in which the arbitral tribunal had been\n\nconstituted, in itself gave rise to any justifiable doubts about the independence and\n\nimpartiality of the arbitral tribunal. None of the grounds raised by the petitioner in its\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_75\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_76\">13</a> of the Arbitration Act, were permissible in view of\n\nthe phraseology of <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 12 (3)</a> of the Arbitration Act and the said application was\n\ntherefore, rightly rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">42.   It was further submitted on behalf of the respondent that the grounds of challenge\n\nraised by the petitioner in the present petition, under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_78\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_79\">13</a>, were not raised\n\nby the petitioner before the Arbitral Tribunal and the same cannot therefore, be\n entertained by this Court. I am of the view that the petitioner had to first raise its\n\nobjections before the Arbitral Tribunal in a timely fashion and if the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nrejects its submissions, the petitioner at the stage of challenging the Arbitral Award, if it\n\nso chooses, could also raise the grounds that it had raised before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act. However, if the petitioner did not or failed to\n\nraise an objection before the Arbitral Tribunal, then in view of <a href=\"/doc/1242720/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 4</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act, the petitioner is deemed to have waived such objection and it cannot, at\n\nthe time of filing a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, raise the same. All\n\nthe objections raised by the petitioner for the first time in the present petition, deserve to\n\nbe rejected on this ground alone. Even otherwise, I am unable to agree with the\n\nsubmission of Mr. Bhat that since, the claims of the respondent have been allowed and\n\nthose of the petitioner have been rejected and the bank guarantees were directed to be\n\nreleased the bias entertained by the Arbitral Tribunal was evident. If the submission of\n\nMr. Bhat is accepted, every arbitral proceeding and award will become illegal and void\n\non the ground of bias as in the final decision the claims and contentions of one party are\n\naccepted and those of the other party are rejected. Under no circumstances can the\n\nrejection of the claims or allowing the claims of the other party by itself lead to an\n inference of bias or partiality. Before an award is set-aside on the ground of bias or\n\nimpartiality on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal, the party alleging the same has to show\n\nand prove the circumstances and facts that clearly demonstrate such bias. Arbitral\n\nAwards cannot be interfered with lightly on the mere allegation of bias or partiality. In\n\nthe present case, besides vague allegations, no such specific instance has been set out or\n\nindeed proved. The respondent had stated that in the arbitration proceedings spread over\n\na period of 4 years the Arbitral Tribunal held 66 hearings out of which 39 hearings were\n\ndedicated exclusively for the submissions and arguments of the petitioner. There is no\n\ndenial of this plea by the petitioner. This in itself shows that more than 50% time was\n\ntaken by the petitioner and the petitioner therefore cannot complain of denial of a fair\n\nopportunity and hearing. The submission that the petitioner was not given a fair and\n\nproper hearing and that its submissions and contentions were not recorded is also\n\nwithout any merit. No specific instances has been given, in the petitioner, as to which\n\nsubmission of the petitioner was not noted and in which manner the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nacted in a partial manner towards the respondent. Even during arguments my attention\n\nwas not drawn to any instance or fact, on the record, that would show that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal was not independent or that it acted in a partial manner towards the respondent\n with bias against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_65\">43.   The contention of the petitioner that the award is vitiated on the ground of bias is\n\ntherefore, rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_66\">44.   As to the submission of Mr. Bhat regarding the award being vitiated on the ground\n\nof submission of statement of claim in two parts, my view is that the said contention also\n\nhas no merit and deserves to be rejected for the reasons stated hereinafter.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">45.   <a href=\"/doc/710617/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 19</a> of the Arbitration Act, provides, thus: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">             &quot;19. Determination of rules of procedure.--(1) The arbitral tribunal shall not be\n             bound by <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_84\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908 (V of 1908) or the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_85\">Indian Evidence\n             Act, 1872</a> (1 of 1872).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">             (2) Subject to this Part, the parties are free to agree on the procedure to be\n             followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its proceedings.\n             (3) Failing any agreement referred to in sub-section (2), the arbitral tribunal may,\n             subject to this Part, conduct the proceedings in the manner it considers\n             appropriate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">             (4) The power of the arbitral tribunal under sub-section (3) includes the power to\n             determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence.&quot;\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">46.   A reading of sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/710617/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 19</a> shows that the legislature has left it to\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal to conduct the proceedings in the manner it considers appropriate,\n\nif there is no agreement to the contrary between the parties. The petitioner has not been\n\nable to draw my attention to any agreement between the parties in respect of the\n\nprocedure for the conductance of the proceedings by the Arbitral Tribunal. Thus, the\n Arbitral Tribunal was free to conduct the proceedings in the manner it considered\n\nappropriate and fair.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">47.   Even though, the respondent had filed its statement of claim in two parts and had\n\nnomenclatured part-I of the statement of claim as &quot;undisputed&quot;, the Arbitral Tribunal did\n\nnot pass the award in respect of the said claims without going into the merits of the\n\nsame. The petitioner, has not shown any claim which has been allowed by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal on the basis that it is in part-I and is nomenclature d as &quot;undisputed&quot; and\n\ntherefore, deserves to be allowed. The Arbitral Tribunal has passed a composite award\n\non merits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">48.   It is not for this Court to decide the procedure that should have been adopted by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal, when the legislature has itself deemed it fit to leave that to the\n\ndiscretion of the Arbitral Tribunal. Further, I am of the view that no prejudice or\n\ninjustice has been caused to the petitioner on account of filing of the statement of claim\n\nin two parts, by the respondent. The Petitioner had filed its reply when both Part-I and\n\nPart-II of the statement of facts had already been filed by the respondent before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal, and the pleas in the reply have been dealt with by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal in the Awards. It is found by the Arbitral Tribunal that there a dispute between\n the parties in respect of the claims made by the respondent in part-I of its claims. The\n\nArbitral Tribunal noted that the claims which are nomenclatured as &quot;Undisputed&quot; and\n\nhad been filed as part-I were a part of the pre-final bill submitted by the respondent\n\nherein, but were not admitted by the petitioner resulting in disputes. Thus, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal clearly considered and proceeded on the basis that there was a dispute between\n\nthe parties even in respect of part-I of the statement of claim was nomenclatured as\n\n&quot;Undisputed&quot;. I am consequently unable to agree with the submission of Mr. Bhat that\n\nsince part-I of the statement of claim was nomenclatured as &quot;Undisputed&quot; the Arbitral\n\nTribunal assumed ipso facto that there existed no dispute between the parties in respect\n\nof the same and proceeded to pass the award in respect of the same as it was undisputed\n\nand admitted by the petitioner. Therefore, this objection of the petitioner does not merit\n\nany interference in the award.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">49.   I, therefore, have no hesitation in rejecting the grounds raised by the petitioner\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_87\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_88\">13</a> of the Arbitration Act and uphold the decision of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal dismissing the petitioner&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_90\">13</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">50.   The grounds raised by the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration Act are a\n rehash of those raised by it under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act namely, that the\n\ndecision of the &quot;Engineer&quot; had become final and binding as the respondent had not\n\ninvoked arbitration with 30 days from the date of such decision and therefore, there was\n\nno question or the appointment of the arbitrators or the constitution of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal; and if no &quot;Engineer&quot; was appointed the arbitration proceedings could not have\n\nbeen initiated, the decision of the &quot;Engineer&quot; being condition precedent to the\n\ninvocation of arbitration. I have already held that the arbitration proceedings had been\n\ncorrectly invoked and the appointment and composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was\n\n\nlegal, valid and in terms of the agreement between the parties. The order dated 18th\n\nAugust, 1998 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal does not therefore suffer from any\n\nillegality or infirmity. The view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal is consequently justified\n\n\nand I affirm the reasoning of the order dated 18th August, 1998. The grounds raised by\n\nthe petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration Act are thus, without any merit and are\n\ntherefore, rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">51.   It is submitted by Mr. R.P. Bhat, learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the\n\npetitioner relying on <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 18</a> of the Act, that the parties were not treated equally. He\n\nsubmits that the Arbitral Tribunal; did not follow the principles of natural justice;\n showed bias towards the respondents; and that they did not act impartially. He further\n\nsubmits that the conduct of the nominee arbitrator of the Respondent shows that he acted\n\nas a convenor only in the interests of the respondent. The representatives of the\n\npetitioner, he submits, were abused, insulted and given unfair treatment. The minutes of\n\nthe meetings were not correctly recorded and only those factors which were convenient\n\nto the arbitrators or to the respondent were recorded. He further submits that the\n\nArbitral Tribunal also did not take cognizance of the documents that were produced.\n\nMany other similar allegations have been made on behalf of the petitioner to buttress its\n\nstand that the awards are vitiated and should therefore, be set aside. These pleas were\n\ndisputed by Shri Kapur as being unsubstantiated and vague.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">52.   General allegations, in my view, without any specific instances, have been made\n\nby the petitioner. No particulars have been given as to how the Arbitral Tribunal did not\n\nfollow the principles of natural justice, in what manner was the Arbitral Tribunal biased\n\ntowards the respondents and which specific instance would demonstrate such bias. The\n\npetitioner has also not specified or brought to the notice of this Court as to which\n\nminutes of the meeting were incorrectly recorded or which document was produced but\n\nwas ignored by the Arbitral Tribunal. In my view, arbitral awards cannot be open to\n challenge merely on the basis of such general and bald allegations. To permit a party to\n\nassail awards on such general allegations, would result in a situation where every\n\nunsuccessful party would question the award by raising such sweeping allegations\n\nwithout furnishing particulars and then leave it to this court to investigate the same. An\n\narbitral award can be questioned only on the grounds mentioned in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_95\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n\nThese grounds have to be specifically set out and pleaded. Merely making a general\n\nstatement like &#x27;documents were not considered by the arbitral tribunal&#x27; is not a ground\n\non which an arbitral award should be set aside by the court. A party making such\n\nallegations has to show, from the records, that what was the document, when was it\n\nfiled, what was its relevance, what would be the impact of the document had it been\n\nconsidered and how the non-consideration of the said document has rendered the award\n\npatently illegal. This not having been done, the objection raised by the petitioner under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 18</a> of the Act is accordingly bereft of any merit and is accordingly, rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_75\">53.   Mr. Bhat, learned Sr. counsel further urged on behalf of the petitioner citing\n\n<a href=\"/doc/597719/\" id=\"a_97\">S.28(3)</a> of the Act that an arbitral tribunal, being the creature of the contract, cannot\n\ndeclare any of the provisions of the contract as null and void and they have to act as per\n\nthe terms of the contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\"> Mr. Kapur relied upon <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 16 (1) (b)</a> of the Arbitration Act, which provides that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">&quot;16(1) (b) a decision by the arbitral tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure\nthe invalidity of the arbitration clause&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\">      Relying upon the said provision, Mr. Kapur for the respondent submitted that the\n\narbitral tribunal has the power to declare/decide whether the contract or any part thereof\n\nis null and/or void. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal has not acted without jurisdiction or\n\ncontrary to law. In my view there is merit in the plea of Mr. Kapur as<a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_99\"> S.16</a> makes it\n\nclear since the contract itself could be declared null and void, it was clearly open to the\n\nArbitral Tribunal to declare a part of the contract to be null and void.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\">54.    He further submitted that the arbitral tribunal could not have assumed jurisdiction\n\nand that the arbitral tribunal has committed a grave error by holding that clause 26 of the\n\ncontract, to the extent that it provides that if arbitration is not initiated within 30 days\n\nfrom the date of the decision of the Engineer, the party shall lose its right to initiate\n\narbitration, was null and void. According to him, the arbitral tribunal has decided the\n\ndispute de-hors the terms of the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_79\">55.    The petitioner&#x27;s counsel further urged that it was not open to the Arbitral Tribunal\n to speculate and arrive at a finding that the performance guarantee tests are deemed to\n\nhave been performed, when they were not and it was immaterial as to why they were not\n\ndone. The Arbitral Tribunal could not have come to the conclusion that conductance of\n\nthe performance guarantee tests (PG tests) was neither possible, nor technically\n\ndependable and making the price adjustment was the only way to sort out the matter\n\ninstead of keeping it pending indefinitely. This, he submits was not within the\n\njurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Further, that no expert opinion was also taken on\n\nthis issue. If any expert&#x27;s opinion had been taken it would have been demonstrated that\n\nthe PG Tests could have been performed at any time. It is submitted that even a minor\n\ndeviation in specifications would result in a serious calamity. That since the respondent\n\ndid not perform the PG tests that entitled the petitioner to deduct a sum of\n\nRs.65,00,000/- in terms of the contract, it was immaterial as to why the PG Test was not\n\ndone. The conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal that an adjustment of Rs.6,00,000/- is to\n\nbe given for non-conductance of the PG Test is without any basis. Even the price\n\nadjustment for not conducting the PG tests was done without asking anything from the\n\npetitioner and on the basis of the rebate given by the respondent, which was never\n\nagreed to by the petitioner. The price adjustment of Rs.6,00,000/- given by the\n respondent was erroneous and without any basis. It had never been agreed to by the\n\nPetitioner and even then the Arbitral Tribunal accepted the said price adjustment as\n\ncorrect, even though the contract provided that 5% of the contract value i.e.\n\nRs.65,00,000/- was to be deducted from the payments to be made to the respondent for\n\nthe non-conductance of the PG tests. This deduction being contractual could not have\n\nbeen denied to the petitioner but the Arbitral Tribunal did not consider this aspect at all.\n\nAccording to him, the Arbitral Tribunal was obsessed with the fact that the trial\n\noperations had been completed and the cooling towers were commissioned and were\n\nfunctioning. The fact that the cooling tower had been commissioned and were\n\nfunctioning would not exonerate the respondent from its obligation of conducting the PG\n\nTests and if the petitioner was not co-operating in the conductance of the PG test, the\n\nremedy lay elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">56.   That insofar as the issue of PG Tests is concerned, the allegation of the petitioner\n\nthat no expert evidence was led or no expert evidence was led or no expert opinion was\n\ntaken is totally misconceived as the arbitrators were themselves experts in the field of\n\nconstruction. Nothing precluded the petitioner from leading expert evidence or citing\n\nan expert opinion but it chose not to do so. Therefore, at this stage the petitioner cannot\n raise an objection on this ground. Further, it is not obligatory for the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nto call for expert evidence and particularly in the present case where the Arbitrators\n\nwere themselves experts in the field. That clause 14, particularly clause 14.3 of the\n\nGeneral Terms &amp; Conditions of the contract provided for the conductance of P&amp;G\n\nTests. In terms of clause 14.3, the PG tests were to be commenced within 2 months\n\nfrom the date of successful completion of trial operations and any extension of time\n\nbeyond the two months could only be by mutual consent of both the parties. The PG\n\ntests were required to be commenced within two months from the successful completion\n\nof trial operation, because the guaranteed performance was to be seen at the time of\n\ncommissioning of the cooling towers, and not after prolonged commercial use as, after\n\nthe cooling towers are put to commercial use, their performance would depend upon a\n\nnumber of factors including clogging of air passages due to dust &amp; dust particles and\n\nformation of fungus and algae in the passages and proper maintenance, upkeep, use etc.\n\nThe German collaborators of the respondent i.e. M/s. Heitkamp, with whom the\n\nrespondent had collaborated with the structural design and construction for the cooling\n\ntowers, and M/s. Balcke Durr, with whom the respondent had collaborated for thermal\n\ndesign, were jointly responsible for the performance guarantee. The PVC fill (a\n component used in the construction of cooling towers through which hot water passes\n\nfrom top to bottom and air passes from bottom to top) was to be procured by the\n\nrespondent on the approval of M/s. Balcke Durr. M/s. Balcke Durr had approved a\n\nGerman company M/s. Munters Euroform for manufacturing and supply of PVC fill.\n\nM/s. Munters Euroform supplied PVC fill for two cooling towers. However,\n\nsubsequently, the petitioner directed that the respondent should procure PVC fill\n\nmanufactured by an Indian company i.e. M/s. Munters India Ltd. Since, the PVC fill\n\nwas being procured from India, M/s. Balcke Durr, refused to come for and perform the\n\nPG Tests. The petitioner then approved M/s. Stup Consultants for carrying out the PG\n\ntests. However, when the engineers and scientists of M/s. Stup Consultants reached the\n\nsite to conduct the PG Tests, the petitioner did not permit them to perform the PG tests\n\non the ground that the thermometers were not calibrated. The petitioner was requested\n\nby the representatives of the respondent and M/s. Stup Consultants (who had come all\n\nthe way from Bombay) that they should be permitted to carry out the tests and note the\n\nresults, subject to the calibration of the thermometers by the petitioner, which could be\n\ndone later. However, the petitioner did not permit them to conduct the tests, though in\n\nterms of clause 14.3.3 of the General Conditions of contract, the tests were to be\n conducted with the instrumentation and equipment available subject to them being\n\ncalibrated by the Engineer. Thus, the petitioner acted contrary to the terms of the\n\ncontract. The respondent then requested the petitioner that they (the respondent) should\n\nbe permitted to carry out the tests in order to record/check the performance of the\n\ncooling towers and even this request also, though acceptable as per British Standard\n\n(BS) 4485, was declined by the petitioner. Existing input and output parameters i.e. the\n\ntemperature of the water at the time of entering and exiting from the cooling towers,\n\nincluding the load of the unit connected with the cooling tower was also neither made\n\navailable to the petitioner or produced by the petitioner before the Arbitral Tribunal and\n\nthe petitioner also did not permit the respondent or its consultant to note the same. M/s.\n\nStup consultants had informed the respondent, that the petitioner had prevented them\n\nfrom carrying out the tests due to some extraneous reasons. The PG tests could have\n\nbeen done only with the cooperation of the petitioner upon the petitioner making the\n\ncooling towers available. For making the cooling towers available for the PG tests the\n\npetitioner would have had to shut down the plant. Further the tests could have been\n\ncarried out only in ambient weather i.e. when the humidity, temperature etc. was within\n\nthe prescribed parameters. The petitioner did not make the towers available for\n conducting the PG tests, this it did not do, as it did not want to shut down the operations\n\nof the plant, which by that time were in full commercial use. The conducting of PG tests\n\nwas a contract based on reciprocal promises inasmuch as that at first the petitioner was\n\nto make the cooling towers available for the tests and thereafter the tests were to be\n\nconducted. Since, the petitioner did not make the towers available for the tests, in terms\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1648530/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 54</a> of the Indian Contract Act, the respondent was not bound to conduct the\n\nPG tests. That in view of the above facts it is clear that the petitioner had prevented the\n\nrespondent from performing the PG tests and therefore, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/372682/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 53</a> of the\n\nIndian Contract Act, the respondent was not bound to perform the PG tests. It is\n\nsubmitted that had the petitioner been serious about conducting the PG tests, it would\n\nnot have prevented the tests from being conducted and would have permitted the\n\nrespondent and M/s. Stup Consultants to carry out the tests and could have calibrated the\n\nequipment later. In fact, the petitioner was never serious about getting the PG tests\n\ndone, the non-conducting of the PG tests was being used by the petitioner as a ploy to\n\ndelay making payments to respondents. Though clause 19.00 of the General Conditions\n\nof Contract provides that in case, the respondent failed to complete any part of the work\n\nthen, the petitioner was free to get the same completed by engaging the services of any\n other contractor and the expenses incurred by the petitioner towards the same would be\n\ndeducted from the amount payable by the petitioner to the respondent, under the\n\ncontract, the petitioner did not get the said tests conducted by any other agency also.\n\nThis he submits clearly, shows that the petitioner itself was not serious about and did not\n\nwant the PG tests to be conducted, as it would entail the shutting down of the plaint\n\n\nwhich was in full commercial use. That the petitioner had by its letter dated 26th\n\nAugust, 1996 requested M/s. Fluid Control Research Institute, to do the PG tests and had\n\nalso informed them that the cooling towers had been operating at a plant load factor of\n\n95.25% and that all four cooling towers were in continuous operations. However, the\n\npetitioner had not submitted the report of the tests done by the said M/s. Fluid Control\n\nResearch Institute. The only inference that could be drawn from the conduct of the\n\npetitioner is that either the tests were successful or the petitioner was not serious about\n\nthem as the same were not mandatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">57.   Mr. Bhat further submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal did not address the real,\n\ngenuine issues arising from the contract and travelled much beyond the provisions of the\n\ncontract. The arbitral tribunal directed the bank guarantees to become inoperative on the\n\ndate of the award and directed their release, which was a breach of the order passed by\n this court in pending proceedings. The Arbitral Tribunal could not have passed an\n\naward in respect of the bank guarantees when the suit in respect of the same was\n\npending before this court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_82\">58.   It was submitted by Shri Kapur that the respondent had invoked arbitration by its\n\n\nletter dated 11th November, 1997 wherein, it was clearly stated that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">             &quot;May it kindly be noted that the pre-final bill referred to above does not in any\n             way restrict or limit the scope of reference to the arbitration. Claims preferred in\n             the pre-final bill as augumented, amended/modified till the time of submission of\n             the statement of case by either party to the arbitration shall comprise the reference\n             to arbitration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">      The reference to arbitration was, therefore, neither limited nor confined to the\n\npre-final bill only. The bank guarantees had been given by the respondent to the\n\npetitioner, under the contract which contained an arbitration agreement. The\n\narbitration proceedings had been initiated by invoking the said arbitration\n\nagreement. Since, the dispute between the parties in respect of the bank guarantees\n\nwas a dispute under the said contract, the same was an arbitrable dispute and had\n\nbeen rightly referred to arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal had by its order dated\n\n\n13th September, 1999 held that the dispute with respect to bank guarantees was a\n dispute under the said contract, the same was an arbitrable dispute and had been\n\n\nrightly referred to arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal by its order dated 13th\n\nSeptember, 1999 held that the dispute with respect to bank guarantees was an\n\narbitrable dispute, and as per <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 8 (3)</a> of the Act, even if the suit was pending,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal was competent to pass an award in respect of the dispute\n\npertaining to the bank guarantees. The dispute in respect of bank guarantees was\n\nrightly and legally referred to arbitration by the respondent.   The respondent had\n\ngiven the bank guarantees to the petitioner in terms of the contract between the\n\n\nparties. The petitioner by its letter dated 20th June 1996, called upon the bank,\n\nwhich had given the said guarantees to either extend the same or to encash the\n\nsame. Due to this conditional invocation, the respondent filed a suit bearing\n\nno.1736 of 1996 before this Court, praying therein, inter-alia for declaration and\n\ninjunction that the petitioner could not invoke the said bank guarantees. In the said\n\nsuit the petitioner had filed its written statement, taking a preliminary objection, as\n\nunder: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">             &quot;10. It is respectfully, submitted that the plaintiff itself has admitted\n             in paragraph 12 of the plaint that the contract between the parties in\n             terms of clause 27 of the general Terms and Conditions of the\n              Contract provides for the settlement of the disputes by arbitration and\n             since the subject matter of the present suit, as admitted by the plaintiff\n             in paragraph 9 is the bank guarantee, the plaintiff cannot seek the\n             adjudication of disputes and differences which are to be resolved as\n             per the arbitration clause, mentioned in the contract entered into\n             between the plaintiff and defendant no.2. The disputes and\n             differences which are required to be adjudicated as per clause 27 of\n             the General Terms &amp; Conditions of the contract have to be referred to\n             the arbitration and the same cannot be the subject matter of the\n             present suit.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_84\">     Thus, the petitioner had itself admitted in the said suit, before this Court, that the\n\ndispute in respect of the bank guarantees was an arbitrable dispute. In the said suit, the\n\nrespondent had filed an application bearing I.A. No. 6419 of 1999, praying therein,\n\ninter-alia, that this court should direct/clarify that the disputes and issues concerning the\n\nbank guarantees in the suit and those raised concerning the bank guarantees by the\n\nrespondent before the arbitral tribunal can be adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal in the\n\npending arbitration proceedings. On the said application, this Court by its order dated\n\n\n23rd July, 2001 after noting that the Arbitral Tribunal had already been constituted and\n\nthe proceedings before it are halfway through, dismissed the said application with the\n\nobservation that the respondent was at liberty to initiate any action under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_103\">Arbitration\n\nAct</a>, as and when the same becomes available to it. Thus, clearly under <a href=\"/doc/411664/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 8 (2)</a> of\n the Act, the Arbitral Tribunal was free to pass an award in respect of the dispute\n\nregarding the bank guarantees. That since, the dispute in respect of release of bank\n\nguarantees was an arbitrable dispute the Arbitral Tribunal rightly adjudicated upon the\n\nsame and declared that the bank guarantees should be released. After the passing of the\n\n\nArbitral Award dated 25th June, 2002, the respondent filed an application in the said\n\nsuit, seeking permission of this Court to withdraw the same. This court, by its order\n\n\ndated 23rd August, 2002 permitted the respondent to withdraw the said bank guarantees.\n\nThe petitioner had filed a written statement in the said suit admitting that the subject\n\nmatter of the present suit i.e. the bank guarantees had to be resolved by arbitration in\n\naccordance with clause 27 of the contract and also sought reference of the disputes to\n\narbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">     I am of the view that in the said suit the respondent filed an application to clearly\n\npray that the dispute in respect of bank guarantees can be adjudicated by the arbitral\n\ntribunal in the pending arbitration proceedings. This Court by its order dated 23.7.2001\n\nnoted that the Arbitral Tribunal had already been constituted and the proceedings before\n\nit had started and gave liberty to the respondent to initiate any action available under the\n\nAct, and with these observations and liberty dismissed the said application. The suit was\n withdrawn on the passing of the Awards. There was, thus, no restriction on or order of\n\nthe court by which the Arbitral Tribunal was precluded from adjudicating and deciding\n\nthe dispute in respect of the bank guarantees. Since, the bank guarantees were given\n\nunder the contract, which contained an arbitration agreement that applied, even as per\n\nthe petitioner, to the bank guarantees, there is no error of jurisdiction in adjudication of\n\ndisputes in respect of the Bank Guarantees by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">59.   Mr. Kapur also submitted as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">(a)   To buttress the plea that the PG tests were not mandatory the respondent relied\n\n\nupon the minutes of meetings dated 10th September, 1993, 13th September, 1993 and\n\n\n28th September, 1993, wherein the petitioner had agreed that in case of non-conductance\n\nof PG tests, it would accept a rebate of approximately Rs.1,50,000/- per tower. The\n\npetitioner had agreed for non-conductance of the PG tests for 3 cooling towers because it\n\nwas fully satisfied with the performance of the cooling tower already handed over, of\n\nwhich along the PG test was to be conducted. However, the petitioner did not permit PG\n\ntests on even one tower.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">(b)   That all the four cooling towers have admittedly been taken over by the petitioner.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">The dates of completion of the cooling towers are as under: -\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">              &quot;Cooling tower No.1             22.04.1992\n             Cooling tower No.2              26.12.1993\n             Cooling tower No.3              20.10.1994\n             Cooling tower No.4              10.07.1995&quot;\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_88\">     As per clause 14.3.1 of the General Technical Conditions of Contract the PG tests\n\nwere to commence within two months from the completion of the trial operations. Trial\n\n\noperations as per the contract were to conclude on the 14th day of continuous operations\n\nof the cooling towers, after the same had been handed over to the petitioner. The last\n\n\ncooling tower was handed over to the petitioner on 10th July, 1995 and that the trial\n\noperation had been conducted. Therefore, the last date for commencing the PG tests for\n\n\nthe last cooling tower was 23rd September, 1995. This was no done, as the petitioner did\n\nnot permit the respondent and infact, prevented the respondent from conducting the PG\n\ntests. He submits that therefore, the obligation of the respondent to conduct the PG tests\n\nstood discharged/waived. Thereafter, the said PG tests become incapable of being\n\nperformed as considerable time, much in excess of the time stipulated in the contract had\n\npassed and the said tests had not been commenced. The only option was to do the price\n\nadjustment for the PG tests, the cost for which was not set out in the contract, it being a\n lumpsum contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_89\">(c)   That till date, NTPC has not alleged that the cooling towers have not been\n\nperforming as guaranteed. Even in the petition there is not a single averment by the\n\npetitioner that the performance of the cooling towers is unsatisfactory or below the\n\n\nguaranteed parameters. On the contrary, in the press release dated 11th February, 1998\n\nthe petitioner has stated that the power plant recorded a plant load factor of 100.55% and\n\nthat the plant also clocked a record monthly generation of 628.42 million units. Thus,\n\nthe cooling towers were performing as guaranteed. The fact that the petitioner took over\n\nthe cooling towers, commissioned them for commercial operations, has been using the\n\nsame for commercial operations for the past 12-15 years, without carrying out the PG\n\ntests; shows that the said tests were not mandatory, because if the PG Tests were\n\nmandatory then the petitioner would not have put the cooling towers to commercial use\n\nfor the past 12-15 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_90\">(d)   That the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal that P&amp;G tests cannot be performed and\n\ntherefore the petitioner was entitled to price adjustment for the same is unexceptionable.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has rightly held that the matter cannot be kept pending\n\nindeterminably and the only resolution would be price adjustment. The petitioner\n cannot be permitted to benefit from its own wrong by on the one hand preventing the\n\nrespondent from performing its part of the contract and on the other hand refusing to\n\nmake payments of the amount due to the respondent on the ground of such alleged non-\n\nperformance. The petitioner could not have demanded performance by the respondent\n\nof an obligation, which the petitioner had itself prevented the respondent from\n\nperforming and/or which the petitioner had because of its breach rendered incapable of\n\nbeing performed and/or which the petitioner had waived by its conduct.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">(e)      In respect of the claim of the petitioner that the price adjusted of Rs.6,00,000/- for\n\nnon-conductance of the PG Tests, as accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal, was incorrect\n\nand not agreed by the petitioner and that the petition was entitled to a price adjustment\n\nof an amount equivalent to 5% of the contract value i.e. Rs.65,00,000/-, it was urged that\n\nthis is not a ground taken by the petitioner in the petition. It is not even a ground in the\n\npetition that the petitioner was entitled to a deduction of Rs.65,00,000/- for the non-\n\nconductance of the PG Tests.

Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to urge, rightly so, that the objections as framed do not\nincorporate specifically the plea regarding the interpretation of escalation clause 10CC. The grounds\nwhich have been taken are all on the issue of re-appreciation of evidence, which cannot be gone into in\nthese proceedings.

If there\nwas a plea to be taken by the petitioner impugning the Award dated 10.03.2005 on the issue of the\ninterpretation of escalation clause 10CC, the plea ought to have been taken specifically.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"719729\" id=\"span_9\"><a href=\"/doc/719729/\" id=\"a_108\">NTPC vs. SAG</a> 2005 (6) AD Delhi 256\n&quot;14. ...He submitted that the parties are bound by their own pleadings which are to be read as\na whole and at a later stage of the proceedings, the parties cannot be allowed to travel beyond\nwhat was pleaded by them.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1357066\" id=\"span_10\">In support of his submission, he has sought support from a number\nof decisions of the Apex Court in the case of Udhav Singh vs. Madhav Rao Scindia (1997) 1\nSCC 511; <a href=\"/doc/1357066/\" id=\"a_109\">Ram Sarup Gupta vs. Bishun Narain Inter College and Ors.</a> (1987) 2 SCC 555 and\nthe Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Bhagwati Prasad vs. Chandrumal laying\ndown a general principle of law that no party should be permitted to travel beyond its pleadings\nand that all necessary and material facts should be pleaded by the party in support of the case set\nup by it and that the object and the purpose of pleading is to enable the adversary to know the\ncase it has to meet.

That\n\neven otherwise, on merits, there is no provision in the entire contract that 5% of the\n\ncontract amount was to be adjusted/deducted by the petitioner in case of non-\n\nconductance of the PG test by the respondent. This plea of the petitioner is not borne\n\nout from any terms of the contract. The contract was a lump-sum contract and the\n\npayments to be made by the petitioner to the respondent were set out in the contract\n\nitself. The contract was not an item-rate contract and therefore, no particular amount was\n\nassigned for conductance of the PG Tests. The manner in which the payments were to\n\nbe made in a phased manner i.e. the entire payment to be made by the petitioner to the\n\nrespondent was divided into instalments and the instalments were to be paid on the\n\nachievement of milestones. The instalment amounts were not in respect of the work\n\ndone only for the milestone achieved but were for the entire contract e.g. the payments\n\nto be made at the time of completion of the PG test were not towards the cost of PG test\n\nbut was also for the other work already done. The cost of conducting the P&amp;G tests was\n\ninbuilt in the entire amount to be paid by the petitioner to the respondent. That the total\n\ncontract value was Rs.13,63,22,750/- (rupees thirteen crores sixty three lakhs twenty two\n thousand seven hundred and fifty only). As per clause 13.02.01 (f), of Annexure-III to\n\n\nthe letter of award dated 7th December, 1988 out of the total of sum Rs.4,57,68,450/-\n\n(rupees four crores fifty seven lakhs sixty eight thousand four hundred and fifty only) to\n\nbe paid by the petitioner to the respondent towards &quot;Ex-works FOB price of\n\nequipment&quot;, 5% (five per cent) of the said amount was to be paid after the completion of\n\nthe Performance &amp; Guarantee tests. Further as per clause 13.02.03 (d), of Annexure-III\n\n\nto the letter of award dated 7th December, 1988, out of the total of sum Rs.16,14,550/-\n\n(rupees sixteen lakhs fourteen thousand five hundred and fifty only) to be paid by the\n\npetitioner to the respondent towards &quot;Erection price component&quot;, 5% (five per cent) of\n\nthe said amount was to be paid after the completion of the PG tests and as per clause\n\n\n13.03.00 (b) (xiv), of Annexure-III to the letter of award dated 7th December, 1988, out\n\nof the total of sum Rs.8,33,49,000/- (rupees eight crores thirty three lakhs and forty nine\n\nthousand only) to be paid by the petitioner to the respondent towards Civil and\n\nStructural portion, 5% (five per cent) of the said amount was to be paid after the\n\ncompletion of the PG tests. The petitioner had no right, contractual or otherwise, to\n\ndeduct 5% of the total contract value towards the cost of non-conductance of PG tests.\n In the meetings that had taken place between the representatives of the petitioner and the\n\n\nrespondent on 10th September, 1993, 13th September, 1993 and 28th September, 1993 it\n\nhad been clearly agreed that for non-conductance of PG tests for 3 cooling towers the\n\npetitioner would accept a rebate of Rs.4,45,500/-. Had the tests been mandatory, then\n\nthe petitioner would not have agreed to the non-conductance of the PG tests for 3\n\ncooling towers. Since, it was the petitioner, who had prevented the respondent from\n\nconducting the PG tests, the only way to resolve the issue was price adjustment which\n\nwas done as per the agreement arrived at between the parties and recorded in the\n\n\nminutes of meetings dated 10th September, 1993, 13th September, 1993 and 28th\n\nSeptember, 1993. Since the PG test for all four towers could not be conducted, applying\n\nthe same rate of rebate i.e. approximately Rs.1,50,000/- for one cooling tower, the\n\nrespondent deducted a sum of Rs 6,00,000/- from their bill. This rebate was given\n\nkeeping in mind that M/s. Stup Consultants, the consultants engaged by the respondent\n\nto carry out the PG tests had informed the respondent that they would charge a similar\n\namount for conducting the PG tests. The arbitral tribunal accepted this adjustment as it\n\nwas on the basis of the agreement between the petitioner and the respondent. The\n\nallegation of the petitioner that 5% of the contract price i.e. Rs.65,00,000/- was to be\n deducted due to non-conductance of PG Test is de-hors and contrary to the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">60.   As to Mr. Bhat&#x27;s submission that the Tribunal ought to have called for expert\n\nopinion on the issue of performance of P.G. Tests, I am of the view that the Arbitrators\n\nwere themselves experts in the field or at least had technical knowledge. It was not for\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal to call for expert evidence when, in their opinion, they did not\n\nrequire it. However, if the parties wanted to lead expert evidence it was for the parties\n\nto lead the evidence and not for the Arbitral Tribunal to secure it for the parties. It is not\n\nthe case of the petitioner that it applied to the Arbitral Tribunal for being permitted to\n\nlead expert evidence but was denied such a request. The claim of the petitioner that no\n\nexpert evidence was called for by the Arbitral Tribunal and therefore, the Arbitral\n\nAward is vitiated, is in my view without any merit particularly where the petitioner itself\n\ndid not bring any expert&#x27;s evidence on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">61.   The PG Test was not done. So far the parties have no dispute. The real\n\ncontroversy between the parties is in respect of the consequence of non-conductance of\n\nPG Tests and as to the amount of price adjustment. The petitioner claims that PG Tests\n\nought to have been done, being mandatory, and if they were not done then the petitioner\n\nwere entitled to a deduction of Rs.65,00,000/- and not Rs.6,00,000/- as has been given\n by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"719729\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"575921\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1257955\" id=\"span_13\">62.   At the outset the respondent has raised an objection to the claim of the petitioner\n\nof its entitlement to deduct a sum of Rs.65,00,000/- as the same was not a part of the\n\npleading before the Arbitral Tribunal and is not even a ground in the present petition.\n\nSince the petitioner did not raise this claim before the Arbitral Tribunal it cannot raise it\n\nnow for the first time before this court in its challenge to the Arbitral Award. The\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1257955/\" id=\"a_110\">B.S.N. Joshi &amp; Sons Ltd. vs. Nair Coal Services\n\nLtd. &amp; Ors.</a> and this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/575921/\" id=\"a_111\">Delhi Jal Board vs. Vijay Kumar Goel</a> and in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/719729/\" id=\"a_112\">NTPC vs. SAG</a> have taken the same view. However, de hors the above\n\nplea even on merits I do not agree with the submission of the petitioner.</span></span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\">63.   The cooling towers were taken over by the petitioner on the following dates:\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">           Cooling tower No.1         22.04.1992\n           Cooling tower No.2         26.12.1993\n           Cooling tower No.3         20.10.1994\nCooling tower No.4         10.07.1995\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">64.   It is also not in dispute that the petitioner has been using the cooling towers\n\ncontinuously and has not got the PG Tests carried out by itself or through any other\n\nentity. The petitioner has been using the cooling towers continuously and without any\n complaint. Neither before the Arbitral Tribunal nor before this Court, the petitioner has\n\nbeen able to point out any deficiency in performance of the Cooling Towers. During the\n\ncourse of arguments a question was put to the counsel for the petitioner that if the tests\n\nwere mandatory and non-conductance thereof, as submitted by it, could result in a\n\ncalamity, why were the cooling towers put into operation and not only that, have been\n\nused continuously for the past almost 12 years. No reply was given to this query.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">65.   The petitioner could have got the PG Test conducted on its own, which was also\n\nnot done. The petitioner has given no reason for the not conducting of the P.G. Test on\n\nits own. Furthermore, in terms of clause 14.3 of the contract the PG Tests were to be\n\ncommenced within 2 months from the date of successful completion of trial operations\n\nand any extension of time beyond the two months could only be by mutual consent of\n\nboth the parties. This was also not done by the petitioner as no consent was obtained\n\nfrom the respondent. The submission of the petitioner that the PG Tests were mandatory\n\nis also contrary to the minutes of the meetings dated 10.09.1993, 13.09.1993 and\n\n28.09.1993, in which the petitioner had agreed that in case of non-conductance of PG\n\nTests it would accept a rebate. The only question that therefore arises for consideration\n\nis whether the petitioner was entitled to a rebate of Rs.65,00,000/- as claimed by it or of\n Rs.6,00,000/- as given by the Arbitral Tribunal. The petitioner claimed a rebate of\n\nRs.65,00,000/- on the ground that in terms of the contract the price of the PG Tests was\n\nRs.65,00,000/- and on non-completion thereof the petitioner was entitled to a rebate of\n\nthat amount without any doubt or deduction and it was not open to the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nto reduce that amount. No such clause in the contract has been brought to the notice of\n\nthis Court. The contract was a lump sum contract. Since, it was not an item rate\n\ncontract no particular price was fixed for a particular job. This, being the admitted case\n\nthe petitioner cannot claim that the price for PG Tests was Rs.65,00,000/- and that it was\n\nentitled to a rebate/deduction of that amount. In terms of the contract the payments were\n\nto be made by the petitioner to the respondent in instalments linked with the progress of\n\nthe work. Release of payment was on completion of a specified activity but the\n\npayment itself was not for that particular activity. Therefore, merely because a sum of\n\nRs.65,00,000/- was to be released on the completion of the PG Tests does not mean and\n\nthe petitioner has been unable to show, that the said amount was for PG Tests only.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">66.   It is an admitted case of the parties that the only thing that remained was the\n\nconductance of the PG Test and all other obligations had been performed. Thus, can it\n\nbe said that because the PG Tests had not been performed the respondent would not be\n made payment for other works done by it merely because payment of such work was\n\nlinked with the completion of the PG Tests. I do not think so. This is not a part of the\n\ncontract. The petitioner could not have refused to make payments in respect of work\n\nthat was done by the respondent and accepted by the petitioner on the ground of non-\n\nconductance of PG Tests. The only rebate/deduction the petitioner was entitled to was\n\nthe price/cost of conductance of PG Test. The petitioner has not brought to the notice of\n\nthis Court any evidence filed by the petitioner before the Arbitral Tribunal as to actual\n\nconduct or the cost of PG Test. In the minutes of the meetings dated 10.09.1993,\n\n1309.1993 and 28.09.1993, the petitioner had accepted a rebate of Rs.4,45,000/- for non-\n\nconductance of PG Tests for 3 cooling towers. The Respondent at the same calculation\n\nof approximately Rs.1,50,000/- per cooling towers, gave a price adjustment/rebate of\n\nRs.6,00,000/- for non-conductance of PG Tests for 4 cooling towers. The Arbitral\n\nTribunal accepted this. The factual conclusion arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal on the\n\nbasis of the minutes of the meeting dated 10.9.1993, 13.9.1993 and 28.9.1993 does not\n\nsuffer from any perversity and consequently does not merit any interference from this\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_102\">67.   It is submitted by Mr. R.P. Bhat, learned senior counsel on behalf of the\n petitioner, that the arbitral tribunal had wrongly directed the petitioner to pay to the\n\nrespondent Exchange Rate Variation (ERV) when the respondent makes payment to its\n\nforeign collaborators. He submits that the requirement of payment of foreign exchange\n\narises only when the liability is incurred and payment is made. In the present case, he\n\nsubmits no liability arose and therefore the question of exchange rate variation awarded\n\ncannot arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_103\">68.   Mr. P.V. Kapur, learned senior counsel for the respondent has submitted that no\n\namount has been awarded for ERV. Therefore, the very premise of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nobjection is erroneous. He submits, that the liability to pay ERV has not been denied by\n\nthe petitioner. By the award the petitioner has only been directed to pay the ERV if and\n\nwhen the respondent makes the payment to the foreign collaborator. So if the\n\nrespondent does not pay its foreign collaborator the petitioner does not have to pay any\n\namount to the respondent. He further submits that since the petitioner had refused to\n\npay to the respondent the sum due and payable to it under the contract, the respondent\n\nwas prevented from making the payments to its foreign collaborators i.e. Heithkamp and\n\nBalke Durr, Germany under the agreements that the respondent had with them. He\n\nsubmits that the petitioner also admits in Ground AI of the petition, that its liability to\n pay the ERV will arise when payment has been made to the foreign collaborator. Thus,\n\nthe liability to pay ERV is not denied by the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">69.   I have considered the above plea. The Award does not direct the petitioner to\n\nmake the payment of the ERV to the respondent without the respondent having made\n\nany payment to its foreign collaborators. The Award in respect of ERV is only\n\ndeclaratory. There is no prohibition in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_113\">Arbitration Act</a>, prohibiting the Arbitral\n\nTribunal from making a declaratory award. It is also not the petitioner&#x27;s case that under\n\nthe contract ERV was not permissible or contemplated and has yet been granted by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal. It is admitted by the petitioner that ERV shall be payable to the\n\nrespondent only when the respondent actually makes the payment to the foreign\n\ncollaborator. This is what the Arbitral Tribunal has directed. The objection of the\n\npetitioner is thus misconceived and does not warrant any interference in the Awards.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">70.   It is then submitted by Mr. R.P. Bhat, learned senior counsel, that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal has awarded interest @ 18% on delayed payment and future interest @ 18% on\n\nthe awarded amounts, from the date of the award till the date of its implementation. His\n\nobjection to the grant of interest is three fold (a) the awarded amount is huge and\n\ntherefore no interest should have been granted (b) there was no stipulation in the\n contract for grant of interest and therefore the Arbitral Tribunal could not have awarded\n\nany amount of interest and (c) for the period prior to the date when the findings are\n\nrendered that the claimant is entitled to the amounts awarded, no interest is payable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">71.   Mr. Kapur, the learned senior counsel for the respondent relies upon <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 31</a>\n\nsub sections (7)(a) and (b) to support the grant of interest. He submits that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal, notwithstanding that there is no provision in the contract for grant of interest,\n\nhas the power to grant interest on the amounts claimed from the date when the cause of\n\naction arose till the date of the award and also on the award from the date of the award\n\ntill the date of payment. It is only when there is contract to the contrary, he submits, that\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest. In the present case there is no contract to\n\nthe contrary. Awarding interest on the amounts claimed, he submits, is the discretion of\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. However, the Arbitration Act provides that an award once made\n\nshall carry interest @ 18% p.a., unless otherwise directed by the arbitrators. According\n\nto him, even if the Arbitral Tribunal does not grant any interest on the awarded amount,\n\nyet by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_115\">section 31(7)(b)</a> of the Arbitration Act, the award shall carry interest @\n\n18% p.a. from the date of the award till its payment. Insofar as the interest on the\n\nawarded amounts is concerned, he submits that the respondent had been denied the use\n of its money and the interest is in no manner excessive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">72.   <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 31</a> sub-sections (7)(a) and (b) of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_117\">Arbitration Act</a> read thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">                   &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 31</a>.

A perusal of the above provision demonstrates that there is no merit in the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s plea that interest could not have been granted as there was no contractual\n\nprohibition from doing so. The objections of the petitioner in respect of quantum of\n\ninterest, in my view, however, deserve consideration. Even though on awards not\n\nspecifying interest, 18% interest is statutorily payable, yet this cannot uniformly apply in\n\nrespect of all awards. Since the current rate of interest is lower, I am of the view that\n\nMr. Bhat&#x27;s plea is justified and the interest granted by the Arbitrators should be reduced\n\nfrom 18% to 12%.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_109\">74.   Mr. Bhat, learned senior counsel for the petitioner has next submitted that while\n the arbitration proceedings were going on the respondent submitted a final bill. The\n\neffect of submission of final bill was that the pre-final bill and all claims made\n\nthereunder stood abandoned and therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal could not have\n\nadjudicated upon them. The Arbitral Tribunal according to him has acted illegally and\n\nwithout jurisdiction by adjudicating claims that formed part of the pre-final bill.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_110\">75.   Mr. P.V. Kapur, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent has\n\nsubmitted that this objection has been raised for the first time during arguments. He\n\nfurther submits that the petitioner has sought to create confusion and that two bills were\n\nnever propounded. According to him this objection is contrary to the pleadings of the\n\npetitioner in the petition inasmuch as in paragraph No. 3 of the petition the petitioner\n\nhad admitted that all the disputes arose from the &quot;pre-final bill&quot; dated 25.07.1996 and\n\nthat no final bill was ever raised. He submits that at the time of arguments only in order\n\nto create confusion and to mislead this Court, a baseless allegation was raised by the\n\npetitioner, contrary to its own pleadings, that a &quot;pre-final bill&quot; and a &quot;final bill&quot; was\n\nraised by the respondent and that since the claims in the &quot;pre-final bill&quot; were given up in\n\nthe &quot;final bill&quot; yet the Arbitral Tribunal adjudicated the claims which were subject\n\nmatter of the &quot;pre-final bill&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_111\"> 76.   Mr. Kapur submits that the respondent had submitted its pre-final bill on\n\n25.7.1996 which was rejected by the petitioner on 09.08.1996 and 16.8.1996. The said\n\nbill was in fact the final bill regardless of its nomenclature, as the respondent raised no\n\nother bill. During the arbitration proceedings, the respondent had filed its statement of\n\nFacts/claims in two parts. With each part a statement giving the summary of the claims\n\nincluded in that particular part was also filed. In other words according to him the bill\n\ndated 25.07.1996, only for the purposes of making a summary of the claims, was divided\n\ninto two parts and part-I thereof was filed with Part-I of the Statement of Facts/Claim\n\nnomenclatured as &quot;final bill&quot; and the other part was filed with Part-II of the Statement of\n\nFacts/claims. He submits that there was no abandonment of any claim under the &quot;pre-\n\nfinal bill&quot; dated 25.07.1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">77.   The petitioner has not raised this objection in the petition and therefore, I am not\n\ninclined to entertain the same. No ground taken orally or in written submission deserves\n\nto be considered unless the same forms a part of the pleadings. A party who wishes to\n\nput forth a ground that is not a party of the pleadings must first amend its pleadings by\n\ntaking permission of the Court and bringing to the notice of the Court the additional\n\ngrounds sought to be urged by it. It is for the Court to permit such amendment or not\n and also to consider if such an amendment is permissible at all. If such amendment is\n\npermitted the other party shall also get a change to respond to the additional pleas sought\n\nto be raised. Pleadings therefore have to be drafted carefully and cannot be merely by\n\noral arguments or written submissions without the other side getting a proper\n\nopportunity to plead their case. Consequently, this plea cannot be entertained and in\n\n\nany case is without merit as it is evident that the bill dated 25th July, 1996 was split into\n\ntwo only for the sake of convenience and can in no manner said to be two distinct pre-\n\nfinal and final bills.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">78.    The petitioner has also assailed the awards on the ground that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal has awarded claims in favour of the respondent which had been settled in the\n\nmeetings held between the parties on 10.09.1993, 13.09.1993 and 28.09.1993. Since the\n\nclaims had been settled, there was no dispute between the parties in respect of the same\n\nand they could not have been a subject matter of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">79.    It is only a dispute that can be referred to arbitration, and if a claim has been fully\n\nand finally settled it certainly cannot be a dispute so as to be referred to arbitration. The\n\npetitioner has been unable to demonstrate to this Court any claim which was settled in\n\nthe said meetings but was yet decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. In fact, the Arbitral\n Tribunal has already held in the Awards that the Extras and additional works claimed by\n\nthe respondent were not raised during the said meetings. The claims which were not\n\nsettled in the said meetings were not precluded from being referred to arbitration. The\n\nobjection of the petitioner is accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">80.   The petitioner has also questioned the awards on the ground that the respondent\n\nwas to provide two butterfly valves to the petitioner at no extra cost to it and that the\n\ncontractual cost of each butterfly valve was Rs.2,00,000/-. The petitioner has claimed\n\nthat the respondent did not provide the butterfly valves. Consequently, the petitioner\n\npurchased one out of the two butterfly valves at a cost of Rs.2,60,000/- and that for the\n\nnon-supply of the other butterfly valve the petitioner has claimed a sum of Rs.14.10\n\nlakhs being the cost of the same at the time of filing the present petition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">81.   I have considered the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of this claim of\n\nthe petitioner. The Arbitral Tribunal has held as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">             &quot;NTPC have claimed a sum of Rs.6,30,000/- for two butterfly valves stated to\n             have been not supplied by the Claimants. An amount of Rs.60,000/- as increase\n             in cost of Butterfly valves has also been claimed separately. Since, the N.T.P.C.\n             have not furnished any proof of actual purchase of Butterfly valves (at the risk\n             and cost of the claimants) and the higher price involved, this Tribunal accepts\n             only Rs.2,00,000/- as cost of each valve provided in the contract. Since the cost\n             of one valve i.e. Rs.2 lakhs has already been deducted in the final bill submitted\n             by the Claimants, the Tribunal awards only Rs.2 lakhs to be paid to the\n              respondents by the Claimants for the second valve.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">82.   The petitioner could not have claimed any amount, in excess of the contractual\n\namount, without furnishing proof thereof. Furthermore, the petitioner has in the present\n\npetition claimed Rs.14.10 lakhs as the cost of spare. While affirming the finding of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal that only one valve was to be paid for by the respondent, I am unable\n\nto accept the valuation of Rs.2 lakhs put by the Tribunal for the said single butterfly\n\nvalve. By its own calculation of Rs.6,30,000/- for the 2 valves, the price of the valve\n\nought to have been Rs.3,15,000/-. Even on this amount the respondent was liable to pay\n\nthe increase of Rs.30,000/- each per valve claimed by the petitioner. In my view, for a\n\nlatter purchase an increase of Rs.30,000/- was reasonable. Consequently the amount\n\npayable by the respondent towards the cost of one butterfly is enhanced from Rs.2 lakhs\n\nto Rs.3,45,000/-. The increase of Rs.30,000/- only per valve which was eminently\n\nreasonable had to be added to the price of Rs.3,15,000/- for the purchase of one butterfly\n\nvalve to be accounted for by the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">83.   The Petitioner has assailed the Awards on the ground that petitioner&#x27;s claims for\n\nexcess consumption of cement and steel by the Respondent was wrongly rejected\n\nwhereas the claim of the respondent for extra item was wrongly allowed by the Arbitral\n tribunal, the petitioners claim for liquidated damages was wrongly rejected while that of\n\nthe respondent was allowed, the claims of the petitioner for advances paid to the\n\nrespondent ought to have been considered and allowed but was wrongly rejected and\n\nmore generally that the claims of the petitioner were wrongly rejected and those of the\n\nrespondent wrongly allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_119\">84.   It is submitted by the respondent that the contract did not include the structural\n\ndesigns and drawings at the time it was concluded. The tender quantities of cement and\n\nsteel were on the basis of the design of a foreign collaborator based on international\n\nstandards. He submits that after the tender had been submitted a meeting took place on\n\n03.11.1988 in which the petitioner requested that the designs, specifications etc. should\n\nbe changed from international standards to Indian Standards. Accordingly, it was agreed\n\nthat the offer given by the respondent was in compliance with the specifications and\n\nrequirements of Indian Standards except for the technical deviations/variations agreed\n\nand discussed in the said meeting. Further, due to non-availability of design sections of\n\nthe sections of steel had to be changed. Thus, clearly the petitioner had to bear the cost\n\nof excess steel as steel, being a free issue item under the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_120\">85.   It was further submitted that soil characteristics and its bearing capacity at the site\n were markedly different from those projected by the petitioner in the tender document.\n\nThis resulted in the change in design of the basin slab, basin foundation, piles and the\n\nlike. These factors he submitted, were directly attributable to the petitioner, resulted in\n\nthe increase of cement and steel consumption.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">86.   It was also contended by the respondent that there was no dispute that all the\n\nquantities of steel and cement issued by the petitioner to the respondent was used in the\n\ncooling towers and that there was no pilferage or theft. He submitted that the lumpsum\n\ncost/charges quoted in the tender were based on quantities of cement and steel to be used\n\nas, given in the tender document. However, since the quantity of cement and steel\n\nactually used in the contract was increased due to the change in designs by petitioner\n\nand due to the wrong information given by the petitioner in the tender document, the\n\nrespondent had also to incur additional labour expenses. It is pertinent to mention that\n\nthe petitioner was aware that the respondent was not doing the work gratuitously, despite\n\nthis the work was accepted by the petitioner and the petitioner is enjoying the benefit of\n\nthe said work. Therefore, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 70</a> of the Indian Contract Act, the\n\nRespondent was entitled to compensation for the work done by it and which was rightly\n\nawarded by the Arbitral Tribunal as per the law enunciated by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n court of India in its decision in the case of V.R. Subhramanyam v/s. B. Tyayappa -\n\nreported in AIR 1966 SC 1034, that:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">&quot;5. Counsel for the appellant submitted that as in the view of the High Court the respondent failed to\nprove the oral agreement pleaded by him, the suit should have been dismissed, and they should not\nhave awarded compensation quantum merit which was not claimed. It was urged that the respondent\nmust succeed or fail on the case pleaded by him, and not on a cause of action not pleaded. In our view,\nthere is no substance in this contention. As we have already observed, in respect of the additional work\ndone by the respondent, both the parties set up conflicting oral agreements. These were not accepted by\nthe High Court. If a party to a contract has rendered service to the other not intending to do so\ngratuitously and the other person has obtained some benefit, the former is entitled to compensation for\nthe value of the services rendered by him. Evidently, the respondent made additional constructions to\nthe building and they were not done gratuitously. He was therefore entitled to receive compensation for\nthe work done which was not covered by the agreement. The respondent claimed under an oral\nagreement compensation at prevailing market rates for work done by him : even if he failed to prove an\nexpress agreement in that behalf, the court may still award him compensation under<a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_120\"> s. 70</a> of the\nContract Act. By awarding a decree for compensation under the Statute and not under the oral contract\npleaded, there was in the circumstances of this case no substantial departure from the claim made by\nthe respondent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">87.    I have considered the rival submission and the Awards. The Arbitral Tribunal has\n\nheld, and in my view, rightly that once it stood admitted by the petitioner that the\n\nmaterial issued by it was used for its project and that there was no theft or pilferage, the\n\npetitioner could not make any claim against the respondent for excess consumption or\n\ndeny the claim of the respondent for additional works which were necessitated due to\n\nsite conditions and the, change in design.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_124\">88.    The petitioner has not questioned the conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal that there\n was change in designs and specifications and that the site conditions were different.\n\nOnce deviation from the tender document as originally stipulated is undisputed, the\n\nresultant change in the consumption and the claim therefore cannot also be disputed.\n\nFurther, the respondent if it had to do additional work, was entitled to, and rightly\n\nawarded for the additional work. These objections raised by the petitioner therefore do\n\nnot merit any interference in the Award and are accordingly rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">89.   The objection raised by the petitioner&#x27;s counsel Sh. Bhat is that the advances were\n\nnot adjusted has been considered by the Arbitral Tribunal in the Awards and they have\n\nheld that the amount claims by the petitioner for recovery of advances had been adjusted\n\nin the &quot;pre-final bill&quot;. The petitioner has, however, not set out as to which of the\n\namounts due to it under its claim for recovery of advances had not been adjusted and\n\nwere therefore, recoverable. The claim made by the petitioner is general and sweeping\n\nwithout any particulars or details. The objection by the petitioner is therefore rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">90.   The objections raised by the petitioner with respect to the award of liquidated\n\ndamages, are the following (a) the Arbitral Tribunal used Hudson&#x27;s formula which it\n\nshould not have done; (b) the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that 50% delay\n\nwas attributable to the Respondent and yet awarded liquidated damages in favour of the\n Respondent; and (c) the claim of the petitioner for liquidated damages was rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">91.   At the outset the respondent&#x27;s counsel points out that this is not a ground taken by\n\nthe petitioner in the petition and the respondent has therefore, had not opportunity to\n\ndeal with the same. This is a good reason by itself to reject this objection. However,\n\nsince I have heard both the senior counsel on this plea I am dealing with the issue on\n\nmerits as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">92.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_14\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_121\">Mc.Dermott International Inc. Vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. And\n\nOrs.</a> - (2006) 11 SCC 181 cited by the respondent, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court after\n\ntaking note of the various formulae available for calculating damages, including the\n\nHudson formula, has held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">                   &quot;106. We do not intend to delve deep into the matter as it is an accepted\n                   position that different formulae can be applied in different circumstances\n                   and the question as to whether damages should be computed by taking\n                   recourse to one or the other formula, having regard to the facts and\n                   circumstances of a particular case, would eminently fall within the domain\n                   of the arbitrator.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">                   107.    If the learned arbitrator, therefore applied the Emden Formula in\n                   assessing the amount of damages, he cannot be said to have committed an\n                   error warranting interference by this Court&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_129\">93.   The Arbitral Tribunal in the present case comprised of Engineers, two of whom\n\nwere appointed by the President, Institution of Engineers. Their decision to apply the\n Hudson Formula for calculating the damages and expenses cannot be faulted merely\n\nbecause they choose to apply the said formula. This objection of the petitioner thus has\n\nno merit and is therefore, rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">94.   The Respondent had made claim of Rs.445.50 lakhs on account of losses and\n\ndamages suffered by it (respondent) due to prolongation of completion period and the\n\npetitioner had made a claim of Rs.65.05 lakhs on account of liquidated damages for\n\ndelay attributable to the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">95.   In the award the Arbitral Tribunal has held that it was respondent&#x27;s case that time\n\nand again extension was granted by the petitioner, agreeing that no liquidated damages\n\nwould be charged till the extended period, showed that delay was occasioned because of\n\nreasons attributable to the petitioner. The Arbitral Tribunal also notes that despite being\n\ncalled upon to do so, the petitioner did not furnish any tabulated statement setting out the\n\ndelays caused by the respondent. The Arbitral Tribunal further held that there was a\n\nforce majeure clause in the contract and any delay caused due to force majeure had to\n\nbe excluded. In the view of the refusal by the petitioner to submit the tabulation, the\n\nArbitral Tribunal rightly drew an adverse inference against it and held that the petitioner\n\nwas responsible for 50% of the delay. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal, by applying the\n Hudson Formula, calculated only 50% of the amount which would otherwise have been\n\npayable. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal directed the petitioner to pay only 50% of the\n\namount of losses and damages suffered by the respondent on account of the prolongation\n\nof the work. The objection raised by the petitioner, namely that the Arbitral Tribunal\n\ndespite holding that the respondent was liable for 50% of the delay granted the entire\n\nclaim, is therefore, clearly misconceived and is rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">96.   The third objection raised by the petitioner is in respect of the rejection of its\n\nclaim of liquidated damages, in view of the fact that liquidated damages have been\n\nprovided for in the contract and the Arbitral Tribunal having come to the conclusion that\n\nthe petitioner was liable for only 50% of the delays. At first blush, this argument seems\n\nattractive. However, on consideration it appears that this objection is also without merit.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">97.   The Arbitral Tribunal has declined the petitioner&#x27;s claim for liquidated damages\n\ninter alia, for the following reasons:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">a.    Failure on the part of the petitioner to give notice to the respondent, of its\n\n(petitioner&#x27;s) intention to claim compensation for delay when possession of cooling\n\ntowers was taken by the petitioner, which disentitled the petitioner to claim\n\ncompensation in terms of <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 55</a> of the Indian Contract Act, 1872;\n b.    Refusal by the petitioner to furnish any details in respect of its claim for liquidated\n\ndamages;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">c.    Non-production of any evidence by the petitioner to show any damage suffered by\n\nit on account of alleged delay on the part of the respondent; and\n\nd.    Cooling Tower no. 1 even though it was completed in April 1992 was not\n\ncommissioned till November/December 1992, showed that no loss or damage was\n\nsuffered by the petitioner.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">98.   I have considered the reasons given by the Arbitral Tribunal for rejecting the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s claim for liquidated damages, which are germane and relevant, and I do not\n\nfind any illegality or infirmity in the same. The Arbitral Tribunal, has rightly rejected\n\nthe petitioner&#x27;s claim for liquidated damages. I am also fortified in my view because\n\neven before this Court, no ground has been made out by the petitioner that it was entitled\n\nto liquidated damages because the Arbitral Tribunal had in a patently illegal manner\n\nrejected the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_135\">99.   The petitioner has raised several other objections in its petition, however the said\n\nobjections are completely lacking in particulars and the counsel for the petitioner at the\n time of bearing did not seriously urge the other objections.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">100. Arbitration proceedings and Arbitral Awards are not a prelude to court\n\nproceedings by way of appeals against the award. Arbitration proceedings are a\n\nseparate/alternative forum selected by the parties for expeditious redressal of their\n\ndisputes because of the finality attached to such decisions. Courts in all jurisdictions\n\nhave made efforts to uphold such finality rather than to upset it. The Parliament of India\n\nby enacting the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_123\">Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and also the Courts of India in\n\nvarious judgments have time and again recognized such finality and have encouraged it.\n\nThis Court in the case of Gian Chand Totu (supra) has held that the illegality attached\n\nto the award warranting interference from the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 34</a> of the Act should\n\nnot be of trivial nature but should be patently illegal going to the root of the matter and\n\nmust shock the judicial conscience of the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">101. In the present case, the petitioner has not been able to set out any ground on merits\n\non which the Arbitral award merits interference from this Court except in the case of the\n\nbutterfly valve and the award is modified and respondent held liable to pay\n\nRs.3,45,000/- instead of Rs.2,00,000/- ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal on this claim.\n\nThis amount of Rs.3,45,000/- instead of Rs.2,00,000/- shall be adjusted from the amount\n payable by the petitioner to the respondent. However, I also allow the plea of the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner Shri Bhat that in light of the current interest rates levy\n\nof 18% interest per annum was excessive and consequently reduce the rate of interest\n\nawarded by the Arbitral Tribunal to 12% uniformly. The present petition is accordingly\n\ndismissed with the above modifications with costs of Rs.20,000/- in favour of the\n\nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">                                           (MUKUL MUDGAL)\n                                              JUDGE\nApril 17, 2009\nsk\n </p>","numcites":42,"numcitedby":21,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":101695797,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"arbitration act section 12","formInput":"arbitration%20act%20section%2012"},{"value":"arbitration section 12","formInput":"arbitration%20section%2012"},{"value":"impartiality of independent","formInput":"impartiality%20of%20independent"},{"value":"expert opinion","formInput":"expert%20opinion"},{"value":"expert evidence","formInput":"expert%20evidence"},{"value":"\"arbitrable dispute\"","formInput":"%22arbitrable%20dispute%22"},{"value":"appointment of arbitrator/","formInput":"appointment%20of%20arbitrator/"},{"value":"\"bias\"","formInput":"%22bias%22"},{"value":"final bill","formInput":"final%20bill"},{"value":"indian contract act","formInput":"indian%20contract%20act"},{"value":"contract appointment","formInput":"contract%20appointment"},{"value":"biasness of arbitrators","formInput":"biasness%20of%20arbitrators"},{"value":"arbitral tribunal ","formInput":"arbitral%20tribunal%20"},{"value":"performance guarantee","formInput":"performance%20guarantee"},{"value":"STUP","formInput":"STUP"},{"value":"arbitral award","formInput":"arbitral%20award"},{"value":"institution of engineers","formInput":"institution%20of%20engineers"},{"value":"public policy","formInput":"public%20policy"},{"value":"stup consultants","formInput":"stup%20consultants"},{"value":"constitution of arbitral tribunal","formInput":"constitution%20of%20arbitral%20tribunal"}],"cats":[{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"},{"value":"power-to-remit-award","formInput":"tag:power-to-remit-award"},{"value":"application-for-setting-aside-arbitral-award","formInput":"tag:application-for-setting-aside-arbitral-award"},{"value":"arbitral-tribunals-jurisdictional-competence","formInput":"tag:arbitral-tribunals-jurisdictional-competence"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
