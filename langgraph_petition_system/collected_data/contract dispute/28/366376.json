The appellant-Board  runs a  Thermal Power\t Station  at\nUkai  in   Gujarat  where   it\tgenerates   and\t distributes\nelectricity to\tthe consumers.\tAt the relevant time besides\nthe direct  workmen,  the  Board  deployed  through  various\ncontractors 1500  skilled and  unskilled manual labourers to\ncarry on  the work  of loading and unloading of coal and for\nfeeding the  same in  the hoppers and for doing the cleaning\nand other allied activities in its power station. It appears\nthat these  workmen hailed from the adivasi area and many of\nthem had  lost their  land on account of the construction of\nthe Thermal  Power Project of the Board with the result that\nthe employment\tin the\tpower station  was the only means of\nlivelihood left\t for them. The contractors, according to the\nrespondent-Union, exploited these workmen by flouting labour\nlaws. Ultimately,  the workmen\torganised themselves  into a\ntrade union.  But on  that count they were victimised and on\n16th November,\t1981, the  services of\ta thousand  of these\nworkmen were  abruptly\tterminated.  The  Union,  therefore,\nfiled  a  writ\tpetition  in  the  High\t Court\tpraying\t for\ndirection to  reinstate the workmen and for implementing and\nenforcing the  Factories Act,  the Employees&#x27; Provident Fund\nAct, the  Payment of  Wages Act and other labour enactments.\nThe High  Court\t by  its  order\t of  16th    December,\t1981\nappointed one  Shri Israni  as a  Court Commissioner to make\ndetailed enquiries  regarding the  allegations made  in\t the\nwrit petition and also to try to resolve the dispute between\nthe parties.  The Commissioner held talks with the concerned\nparties and  also associated  the  officers  of\t the  Labour\nDepartment of  the Government  with the\t said talks.  It was\nagreed by  and between\tthe parties, viz., the Board and the\ncontractors on\tthe one\t hand and  the workmen on the other,\nthat all  the workmen  whose names and numbers were mutually\nagreed to,  be allowed\tto enter  the power station for work\nfrom 4th January, 1982 and that a settlement under Section 2\n[p] of\tthe <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_1\">Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</a> [for short the `<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_2\">ID\nAct</a>&#x27;] be duly executed in that behalf. It was further agreed\nthat the remaining disputes between the parties, viz., those\nrelating to  the revision  of wages  of the  workmen,  their\nrights and  privileges arising\tout of\tthe  Factories\tAct,\nEmployees&#x27; Provident  Fund Act,\t Maternity Benefits  Act and\nthe Workmen&#x27;s  Compensation Act as well as the disputes with\nregard to  the\tworkmen&#x27;s  contention  that  they  were\t the\nemployees of  the Board,  be referred  for adjudication by a\njoint  reference  under\t <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_3\">Section  10</a>  [2]  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_4\">ID\tAct</a>.\nAccordingly, a\tjoint application  was made to the Assistant\nCommissioner of\t Labour under  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 10</a>  [2] of the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_6\">ID Act</a>\nrequesting  him\t that  the  disputes  mentioned\t therein  be\nreferred for  adjudication to  the Industrial  Tribunal\t and\nconsequently  the   reference\tfrom   which   the   present\nproceedings arise  was made. The terms of the reference were\nas follow:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     (1) Whether  the workers  whose services are engaged by\nthe contractors,  but who  are working\tin the Thermal Power\nStation of  Gujarat Electricity\t Board at  Ukai, can legally\nclaim to be the employees of the G.E.B.?

Before the\t Tribunal, the\tUnion filed the statement of\nclaim as well as an application for interim relief. Both the\nBoard and  the contractors  submitted  their  reply  to\t the\napplication for\t interim relief. The Tribunal gave its award\nbeing Award  Part I  dated 30th\t April, 1982  giving interim\nrelief whereby\tthe Board  was directed\t to pay wages to the\nworkmen at  the rate of Rs.9.40 per day from 1st April, 1982\ntill the  disposal of  the main\t reference. Under  the\tsaid\nAward, the  Board was  directed to give to the workmen leave\nwith wages  and weekly off in accordance with the provisions\nof the\t<a href=\"/doc/1955064/\" id=\"a_7\">Factories Act</a>,\tand maternity  benefits as  per\t the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_8\">Maternity Benefits Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     To the  main reference,  written statements  were filed\nboth by\t the Board and the contractors. The Board also filed\napplication stating  therein that  in the  meanwhile some of\nthe contractors who were engaged and who were parties to the\nreference were\tno longer  working  with  it  and  that\t new\ncontractors were engaged in their place. The Tribunal joined\nthe new contractors as parties to the dispute. Likewise, the\nUnion also  made an  application for  joining  some  of\t the\ncontractors as\tparties and  they were\tjoined as parties to\nthe  reference.\t Some  contractors  filed  applications\t for\ndecision on  the preliminary  point raised  in their written\nstatement that\tsince demand  nos. 1  and 2 in the reference\namounted to a demand for abolition of contract labour system\nthe Tribunal  had no  jurisdiction  to\tentertain  the\tsaid\ndemand and  that the  said point should be heard first. This\napplication was rejected by the Tribunal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1025456\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"935343\" id=\"span_2\">After recording  evidence and  hearing the parties, the\nTribunal by  its award\tcame to\t the conclusion that quite a\nnumber of  skilled and\tunskilled employees were employed in\nthe Thermal  Power Station  for unloading  of  coal  wagons,\nbreaking  of   coal,  feeding  them  in\t hoppers,  stacking,\ncleaning  earth\t  work,\t fabrication  jobs  etc.,  that\t the\nlabourers were the local advasis and they were not given any\nleave or other facilities before 1982 except the wages which\nwere very  meagre, that\t workmen were  doing  all  types  of\nunskilled jobs\twhich they  were asked\tto do  and that they\nwere  rotated\tin  different\tjobs.  Further,\t  while\t the\ncontractors had\t changed, the  workmen continued to work and\nthe workmen  were working  for periods\tranging from  5 to 8\nyears. The  contractors had  not maintained  any records and\nwere  not   providing\tany   facilities   whatsoever.\t The\ncontractors  had   no  licence\tunder  the  Contract  Labour\n[Regulation and\t Abolition] Act,  1970 [hereinafter referred\nto as  the &#x27;Act&#x27;] and that no releevant original certificate\nof registration\t or licence  had been vrought on record. The\nregistration certificate  and four  licences produced by the\nBoard were  ignored by\tthe Tribunal on the ground that they\nwere only copies and nothing had been produced in support of\ntheir  authenticity.   The  Tribunal  also  held  that\tever\notherwise, these  documents  were  not\trelevant  since\t the\nregistration   certificate   produced\tpertained   to\t the\ncontractors who were not concerned in the present case while\nthe licences  produced were  for a  period subsequent to the\ndate of\t the reference. The Tribunal relied on the decisions\nof the\tHigh Courts  of\t Madras\t and  Karnataka,  viz.,\t <a href=\"/doc/935343/\" id=\"a_9\">The\nWorkmen\t of   Best  &amp;\tCromption  Industries  Ltd.  v.\t The\nManagement of  Best &amp;  Cromption Engineering  Ltd., Madras</a> &amp;\nors. [1985 (<a href=\"/doc/1025456/\" id=\"a_10\">1) LLJ 492 and Food Corporation of India Loading\nand Unloading  Workers&#x27; Union  v. Food\tCorporation of India</a>\n[1987 (1)  LLJ 407]  respectively and  held that the workmen\nconcerned in  the reference  could not be the workmen of the\ncontractors. The  Tribunal then\t proceeded  to\tanalyse\t the\nposition of  each of  the seven\t contractors involved in the\nreference, and held, on the basis of the evidence concerning\nthe said  contractors and  the workmen\tworking undet  them,\nthat the  workmen of  all the  seven contractors  should  be\ndeemed to  be the  workmen of  the Board.  The Tribunal also\ngave consequential direction for payment of arrears of wages\nto the\tworrkmen by  adjusting the advances which were given\nto them\t by the\t interim directions of the Tribunal. Against\nthe said  award of  the Tribunal, the Board preferred a writ\npetition before the High Court.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">     The High  Court by\t its decision under challenge before\nus, held,  among other\tthings, that there was no demand for\nabolition of  contract labour  system as  contended  by\t the\nBoard and  hence the  preliminary objection  raised  by\t the\nBoard that  the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider the\nquestion of  the abolition of contract labour system in view\nof the\tprovisions of  the Act, had no merit in it. The High\nCourt held that the Tribunal was called upon to decide as to\nwhether the  workers who  were engaged\tfor working  in\t the\nThermal Power  Station were employees of the Board or of the\ncontractors. Hence  the Tribunal was required to examine the\nreality behind\tthe facade after piercing the veil. The High\nCourt also  held, negativing the contention to the contrary,\nthat the  Tribunal had\tnot based  its finding\ton the\tsole\nground that there were no valid licences for certain periods\nfor certain  contractors issued\t under the provisions of the\nAct. The  Tribunal  had\t decided  the  question\t on  overall\nconsideration of  the facts  and circumstances\tand  on\t the\ngrounds apart from the absence of valid licences. One of the\nfactors taken  into consideration  by the  Tribunal was\t the\ncontinuous nature of work.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.   Before us the main contention advanced on behalf of the\nappellant-Board is  that after\tthe coming into force of the\nAct, it is only the appropriate Government which can abolish\nthe contract  labour system  after  consulting\tthe  Central\nBoard or  the State  Board, as\tthe case may be and no other\nauthority   including\tthe   industrial   adjudicator\t has\njurisdiction either  to entertain such dispute or to directs\nits abolition.\tIt is  also contended on behalf of the Board\nthat in\t any case neither the appropriate Government nor the\nindustrial adjudicator\thas the\t power to  direct  that\t the\nworkmen of  the erstwhile  contractor should be deemed to be\nthe workmen  of the  principal employer and such a direction\nis contrary to the provisions of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">The Central  Government or the industrial adjudicator as the\ncase may  be, can  only direct\tthe abolition of the contact\nlabour system  as per  the provisions of the Act but the Act\ndoes not  permit either\t of them  to declare  the  erstwhile\nworkmen of  the\t contractor  to\t be  the  employees  of\t the\nprincipal  employer.  It  is  also  contended  that  if\t the\ncontract  is   genuine\tas  evidenced  by  the\tregistration\ncertificate  granted  to  the  principal  employer  and\t the\nlicence issued\tto the\tcontractor, then it would have to be\nheld that the workmen concerned are in effect the workmen of\nthe contractor and not the workmen of the principal employer\nand hence  no dispute can be raised under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_11\">ID Act</a> by such\nworkmen for  any relief since it is only the workmen present\nor past\t who can  raise such  a dispute under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_12\">ID Act</a> for\nrelief against\ttheir employer.\t On the\t other hand,  it  is\ncontended on  behalf of\t the workmen  that the\tAct does not\nprevent or  prohibit the  raising of  a dispute under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_13\">ID\nAct</a> for\t abolition of  the contract labour system. Where the\ncontract is  genuine, the  workmen of the principal employer\ncan raise  the dispute\tfor abolition of the contract labour\nsystem. Where  it is  not genuine,  the workmen\t of  the  so\ncalled contractors  themselves can  raise a  dispute  for  a\ndeclaration that  they are  in fact  the  employees  of\t the\nprincipal employer.  In either\tcase, on  the basis  of\t the\nwell-known factors  <a href=\"/doc/1025456/\" id=\"a_14\">laid down  by</a> the  judicial decisions to\nestablish the  relationship of the employer and the employee\nbetween the  parties, the Tribunal or the Court, as the case\nmay be,\t will have  jurisdiction  to  declare  the  contract\nlabourers as  the direct employees of the principal employer\nand grant consoquential reliefs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">6.   In view  of the  aforesaid contentions,  the  questions\nthat fall for consideration in this appeal, which are common\nto all the appeals are, as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">[a] Whether an industrial dispute can be raised for\n    abolition of the contract labour system in view of the\n    provisions of the Act?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">[b] If so, who can raise such dispute?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">[c] Whether the Industrial Tribunal or the appropriate\n    Government has the power to abolish the contract labour\n    system? and\n[d] In case the contract labour system is abolished, what is\n    the status of the erstwhile workmen of the contractors?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">6.   We may  first refer  to the  relevant provisions of the\nAct.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">     The Statement  of Objects\tand Reasons accompanying the\nBill provided as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t  &quot;The\tsystem\t of   employment   of\n     contract labour  lends itself to various\n     abuses. The  question of  its  abolition\n     has  been\tunder  the  consideration  of\n     Government\t for  a\t long  time.  In  the\n     second  Five  Year\t Plan,\tthe  Planning\n     Commission made certain recommendations,\n     namely,  undertaking   of\t studies   to\n     ascertain the  extent of  the problem of\n     contract labour,  progressive  abolition\n     of the system and improvement of service\n     conditions of  contract labour where the\n     abolition was  not possible.  The matter\n     was discussed  at\tvarious\t meetings  of\n     Tripartite Committees at which the State\n     Governments were  also  represented  and\n     general consensus\tof opinion  was\t that\n     the system\t should be abolished wherever\n     possible  or  practicable\tand  that  in\n     cases where  this system  could  not  be\n     abolished\t altogether,\tthe   working\n     conditions of  contract labour should be\n     regulated so  as to  ensure  payment  of\n     wages   and   provision   of   essential\n     amentities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     2.\t  The proposed Bill aims at abolition\n     of contract  labour in  respect of\t such\n     categories\t as   may  be\tnotified   by\n     appropriate Government  in the  light of\n     certain criteria  that  have  been\t laid\n     down,  and\t at  regulating\t the  service\n     conditions\t of   contract\tlabour\twhere\n     abolition\tis  not\t possible.  The\t Bill\n     provides for  the setting up of Advisory\n     Boards  of\t  a   tripartite   character,\n     representing   various   interests,   to\n     advise Central  and State Governments in\n     administering   the    legislation\t  and\n     registration   of\t establishments\t  and\n     contractors. Under\t the  Scheme  of  the\n     Bill, the\tprovision and  maintenance of\n     certain  basic   welfare  amenities  for\n     contract labour, like drinking water and\n     first-aid\tfacilities,  and  in  certain\n     cases rest-rooms and canteens, have been\n     made obligatory.  Provisions  have\t also\n     been made\tto guard  against details  in\n     the matter of wage payment.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">     As the preamble of the Act points out, the Act has been\nplaced on  the statute\tbook for  two purposes, viz., [i] to\nregulate the  employment of  contract  labour  and  [ii]  to\nprovide for  its abolition  in certain circumstances and for\nmatters connected  therewith. It  is thus clear that the Act\ndoes contemplate  the total abolition of contract labour but\nits abolition  only in certain circumstances and to regulate\nthe employment of contract labour in certain establishments.\nThe object  as well  as the  provisions of the Act also show\nthat the  Parliament while realising the need for abolishing\nthe contract  labour system  in certain\t circumstances\talso\nfelt the  need to  continue it\tin  other  circumstances  by\nproperly regulating the same. <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_15\">The Act</a> came into force on and\nfrom  5th   September,\t1970.\tIt  applies   to  [a]  every\nestablishment in  which 20  or more  workmen are employed or\nwere employed as contract labour on any day of the preceding\n12 months  and\t[b]  to\t every\tcontractor  who\t employs  or\nemployed on  any day  of the  preceding 12 months 20 or more\nworkmen.

Before issuing the notification prohibiting the\ncontract labour,  the appropriate  Government  has  to\thave\nregard to  the conditions  of work and benefits provided for\nthe contract  labour in the establishment and other relevant\nfactors such  as [a] whether the process, operation or other\nwork is\t incidental to or necessary for the industry, trade,\nbusiness, manufacture  or occupation  that is  carried on in\nthe establishment,  [b] whether it is of a perennial nature,\ni.e., whether  it is of sufficient duration having regard to\nthe nature  of industry,  trade,  business,  manufacture  or\noccupation carried  on in  the establishment, [c] whether it\nis  done   ordinarily  through\t direct\t workmen   in\tthat\nestablishment or  an establishment  similar thereto, and [d]\nwhether it  is sufficient  to employ  considerable number of\nwhole-time workers.  The explanation  to that  section makes\nthe decision of the appropriate Government final with regard\nto the question whether the process, operation or other work\nis of  pernnial nature. The effect of non-registration of an\nestablishment under the Act is that the establishment cannot\nemploy contract labour. So also, the effect of non-licensing\nof the\tcontractor is  that the contractor is precluded from\nundertaking or executing any work through contract labour.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">     It is against the background of these provisions of the\nAct and\t in the\t light of  the decisions of this Court which\nare cited  before us  that we  have to\tanswer the questions\nraised in these appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">9.   On the  basis of  the provisions  of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_44\">Section  10</a>, it is\ncontended that\tno  industrial\tdispute\t can  be  raised  to\nabolish contract  labour in  any process, operation or other\nwork in\t any establishment.  The contention  is two-fold. In\nthe first instance, it is argued that the said section gives\nexclusive  authority   to  the\t appropriate  Government  to\nprohibit contract  labour and  that too\t after following the\nprocedure laid\tdown therein.  Before taking the decision to\nprohibit, the  appropriate Government has to (i) consult the\nCentral Board  or the  State Board, as the case may be; (ii)\nhave regard  to the conditions of work and benefits provided\nfor the\t contract labour  in that  establishment; and  (iii)\nhave regard  to other  relevant factors\t such as (a) whether\nthe process,  operation or  the connected work is incidental\nto,  or\t  necessary  for   the\tindustry,  trade,  business,\nmanufacture  or\t  occupation  that  is\tcarried\t on  in\t the\nestablishment; (b)  whether it\tis of perennial nature, that\nis to say, it is of sufficient duration having regard to the\nnature\tof   industry,\ttrade,\t business,  manufacture\t  or\noccupation carried  on in that establishment; (c) whether it\nis  done   ordinarily  through\t direct\t workmen   in\tthat\nestablishment  or  an  establishment  similar  thereto;\t (d)\nwhether it  is sufficient  to employ  considerable number of\nwholetime workmen. The other contention is that the decision\nof the\tappropriate Government\tin that\t behalf is final and\nthe decision  is not  liable to\t be challenged\tin any Court\nincluding before the industrial adjudicator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">10.  In support of the first contention, reliance was placed\non the following decisions of this Court :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"462941\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/462941/\" id=\"a_45\">Vegoils Pvt. Ltd. v. The Workmen</a> [(1972) 1 SCR 673],\nthe facts were that the appellant, a private limited company\ncarried on  the business of manufacturing edible oils, soaps\nand certain  by products,  and employed\t about 700 permanent\nworkmen for  the purpose. However, for loading and unloading\nseed and  oil cake  bags and  for  feeding  hoppers  in\t the\nsolvent extraction  plant,  it\temployed  labour  through  a\ncontractor. The\t direct workmen raised an industrial dispute\nclaiming, inter alia, that the work of loading and unloading\nseed bags  as well  as that  of feeding\t hoppers  was  of  a\nperennial nature and hence the contract labour in respect of\nthe said  work should  be abolished. The industrial Tribunal\nheld that  the work of feeding the hoppers could not be said\nto be  intermittent and\t sporadic as  claimed by the company\nand  that  it  was  closely  connected\twith  the  principal\nactivity of  the appellant.  The Tribunal  also\t recorded  a\nfinding that  in similar  plants in  the region, the work of\nfeeding the  hoppers was  carried on  by permanent  workmen.\nHence, the  Tribunal held  that the company should carry out\nthis work  through permanent workmen. As regards loading and\nunloading of  seed and\tcake bags,  the Tribunal  held\tthat\nthese activities  were also  closely connected with the main\nindustry and the work was of a permanent character. Although\nthe comparable\tunits in  the same  region  carried  on\t the\nworking of  loading and\t unloading through  contract labour,\nthe Tribunal  held that\t since the contract labour has to be\ndiscouraged,  the   appellant  must  employ  only  permanent\nworkmen for  doing the\tsaid job  as well. The Tribunal then\nreferred to  the Act, [i.e., the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_46\">Contract Labour (Regulation\nand Abolition)\tAct</a>] as\t well as to a State enactment, viz.,\nMaharashtra  Mathadi   Hamal  and   Other   Manual   Workers\n[Regulation  of\t  Employment  and  Welfare]  Act,  1969\t and\nobserved that  these two enactments also supported its view.\nIn  appeal  before  this  Court,  the  company,\t apart\tfrom\nquestioning the\t Tribunal&#x27;s decision  on merits,  challenged\nthe jurisdiction of the Tribunal to consider the question of\nthe abolition  of contract  labour in view of the provisions\nof the\ttwo Acts. This Court held that the Tribunal acquired\njurisdiction  to  entertain  the  dispute  in  view  of\t the\nreference made by the State Government on April 17, 1967. On\nthat date,  neither the\t Central Act nor the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_47\">Maharashtra Act</a>\nhad been  passed. Even\tduring the  proceedings\t before\t the\nTribunal, the  company raised no objection after the passing\nof the\ttwo enactments\tthat  the  Tribunal  had  no  longer\njurisdiction to\t adjudicate upon  the dispute.\tUnder  these\ncircumstances, the  Tribunal  had  to  adjudicate  upon\t the\npoints referred\t to it\thaving due  rgard to  the principles\n<a href=\"/doc/462941/\" id=\"a_48\">laid down  by</a> the  courts particularly\tthis Court governing\nthe abolition  of contract  labour. The\t <a href=\"/doc/462941/\" id=\"a_49\">Court further\theld</a>\nthat the Act had received the assent of the President before\nthe passing  of the Tribunal&#x27;s award while the State Act had\ncome into  force before the passing of the award. Though the\ncontention that\t the Tribunal  lost jurisdiction to consider\nthe question  of contract labour in view of these enactments\ncould not  be accepted, it was held that this Court would be\njustified when\tdealing with  the  appeal,  to\tgive  effect\nparticularly to\t the provisions of the Act having due regard\nto the clearly expressed intention of the legislature in the\nsaid Act  regarding the\t circumstances under  which contract\nlabour could  be abolished.  The Court\talso held  that even\naccording to  the evidence of the company&#x27;s witnesses it was\nclear that  the feeding of hoppers in the solvent extraction\nplant was  an activity closely and intimately connected with\nthe main activity of the appellant, and that excepting for a\nfew days, this work had to go on continuously throughout the\nyear. It  could not  also be said that by employing contract\nlabour for  the purpose,  the appellant\t would be enabled to\nkeep down  the costs  on the  ground that there would not be\nsufficient work\t for all the workmen if permanent labour was\nemployed. Further,  the award of the Tribunal abolishing the\ncontract labour\t in respect of feeding the hoppers was fully\njustified because  it was  in accordance with the principles\n<a href=\"/doc/462941/\" id=\"a_50\">laid  down   by</a>\t this\tCourt\twhich\twere   substantially\nincorporated in\t clauses [a] to [d] of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 10</a> [2] of the\nAct and upheld the direction of the Tribunal in that regard.\nHowever, this  Court held  that the  Tribunal&#x27;s direction to\nthe company  not to  engage any\t labour through a contractor\nfor the work of loading and unloading after May 1, 1971 must\nbe set\taside. Since  the Act  had come\t into force  on 10th\nFebruary,  1971\t  and  under  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  10</a>  of  the  Act\t the\njurisdiction  to   decide   matters   connected\t  with\t the\nprohibition of contract labour was vested in the appropriate\nGovernment, it\tis only the appropriate Government that\t can\nprohibit contract  labour by  following the procedure and in\naccordance with\t the provisions\t of the\t Act. The Court also\nheld that  the Industrial  Tribunal in the circumstances had\nno jurisdiction,  though its award was dated 20th Noveember,\n1970, to  give a  direction in\tthat respect  which  becomes\nenforceable after  the date  of the coming into operation of\nthe Act.  Further under\t clause [c] of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 10</a> [2] of the\nAct, one  of the  relevant factors  to be taken into account\nwhen contract  labour regarding\t any particular type of work\nis proposed  to be established, is whether that type of work\nis  done   ordinarily  through\t direct\t  workmen   in\t the\nestablishment or  an establishment  similar thereto.  In the\ncase before  the Court,\t similar establishments\t employments\nemployed contract  labour for  loading and unloading but the\nevidence also  showed that the work of loading and unloading\nrequired varying number of workmen.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">     It will thus appear from this decision firstly, that an\nindustrial dispute  can be  raised by  the direct workmen of\nthe establishment  for\tabolition  of  the  contract  labour\nsystem. Secondly,  although on\tthe  date  the\tdispute\t was\nraised the  Act was not in force, and hence the dispute with\nregard to the abolition of the contract labour system had to\nbe decided by the Tribunal, since the Act came into force at\nthe time  of the  decision, the dispute had to be decided in\naccordance with\t the provisions\t of the\t Act. Hence  on\t and\nafter the  coming into\tforce of the Act, no direction could\nbe given  by the Industrial Tribunal to abolish the contract\nlabour system,\tsince the  jurisdiction to  give  directions\nwith regard  to the  proibition of contract labour is vested\nin the appropriate Government.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">     In B.H.E.L.

It was\nfurther alleged that the management paid to the contractors,\nand in\tturn, the  contractors paid  salary to\tthem,  after\ndeducting substantial commission, and the wages paid to them\ndid not\t bear comparison to the wages paid to those directly\nemployed by  the company.  Hence it  was  alleged  that\t the\nrights of the contract workers were infringed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_55\">Articles\n14</a> and\t<a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_56\">19 [1]\t(f) [</a>  sic. - g? ] of the Constitution and a\ndeclaration was\t sought from  the Court\t that the  system of\ncontract labour\t prevalent  in\tthe  respondent-company\t was\nillegal, the contract employees were the direct employees of\nthe respondent-company\tand entitled  to equal\tpay  as\t the\nworkmen directly  employed. The\t respondent-company  opposed\nthe petition  by contending  that if the petitioners had any\ngenuine grievance, they could avail themselves of the rights\nsecured to  them under\tthe Act,  Minimum Wages\t Act,  Equal\nRemuneration Act,  etc. for  seeking appropriate  relief. It\nwas further  contended on behalf of the company that certain\njobs though required to be done within the plant area, could\nmore conveniently  and efficiently be done on a job contract\nbasis, and  this was  actually due  to the introduction of a\nnew technology\tfor expansion  of production  programme with\nforeign collaboration. The jobs themselves were entrusted to\ncontractors and\t it was\t not appropriate  to  say  that\t the\ncontractors merely  supplied the  labour. They were required\nto do the total job and payment was made on the basis of the\nquantum of work involved and not on the basis of the workers\nemployed by  the contractor.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"462941\" id=\"span_4\">This Court  dismissed the writ\npetition by  holding that  the Act  does not provide for the\ntotal abolition\t of contract  labour, but  for its abolition\nonly in certain circumstances, and for the regulation of the\nemployment of contract labour in certain establishments. <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_57\">The\nAct</a>  is\t  not  confined\t  to  private  employers  only.\t The\ndefinition of  &#x27;establishment&#x27; under  <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 2</a>\t [e] and  of\n&#x27;principal employer&#x27;  under <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_59\">Section  2</a> [g] expressly include\nthe Government\tor any of its departments.

Contract labour  is entitled\tto the\tsame\nwages, holidays, hours of work, and conditions of service as\nare applicable to workmen directly employed by the principal\nemployer of the establishment on the same or similar kind of\nwork. They  are entitled  to recover  their wages  and their\nconditions of service in the same manner as workers employed\nby the\tprincipal employer  under the appropriate Industrial\nand Labour  Laws.

Since  a  long  time,  they\twere\nagitating for  the abolition  of the  contract labour system\nunder which  they were\temployed to  do the cleaning work in\nthe catering  establishments and  pantry cars  and for their\nabsorption as  direct employees\t of the\t principal employer,\nviz., the  Southern Railway.  Although the  contract  labour\nlabour system  had been abolished in almost all the railways\nin the\tcountry, the Southern Railway persisted in employing\ncontract labour\t for  doing  the  work\tin  question.  Since\nseveral representations\t made by  them\tto  the\t authorities\nproved fruitless,  they approached  this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_66\">Article\n32</a> of  the Constitution\t to direct  the respondent-Union  of\nIndia and  others to  exercise their  power under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 10</a>\n[1] of\tthe Act\t and to\t abolish  the  contract\t system\t and\nfurther to direct the Railways to regularise the services of\nthe existing  catering cleaners\t and to\t extend to  them the\nservice benefits  then\tavailable  to  other  categories  of\nemployees  in\tthe  catering  establishments.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"777307\" id=\"span_6\">The  Railway\nadministration opposed\tthe writ petition contending that it\nhad not\t been found  possible to abolish the contract labour\nbecause the  nature of\tthe cleaning  work in  the  catering\nunits  of   the\t Southern   Railway,  was   fluctuating\t and\nintermittent. The  Court  referred  to\tthe  report  of\t the\nParliamentary Committee\t which had  held  that\tthe  job  of\ncleaning in Railway catering units was of a permanent nature\nand the work if entrusted to the direct employees would only\nmarginally increase  the cost. The Committee had recommended\nthe employment of cleaners directly by the Railways to avoid\ntheir exploitation.

After analysing\nthe provisions of the Act, the Court held that on the facts,\nit appeared  to it  to be  clear that  the work\t of cleaning\ncatering establishments\t and pantry  cars was  necessary and\nincidental to  the industry  or\t business  of  the  Southern\nRailway, that  the work\t was of\t a perennial nature, that it\nwas done  through direct  workmen in  most Railways  in\t the\ncountry\t and  that  the\t work  required\t the  employment  of\nsufficient  number   of\t whole-time  workmen  and  thus\t the\nrequirement of\tclauses [a]  to [d] of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 10</a> [2] of the\nAct were  satisfied. In addition, the Court found that there\nwas a factor of profitability of the catering establishments\nwhich  as   stated  in\t the  report  of  the  Parliamentary\nCommittee, was\tmaking a  profit of  Rs.50 lakhs  per annum.\nHowever, even  on these\t findings, the\tCourt held  that the\nwrit petitioners  could not  invite the\t Court\tto  issue  a\nmandamus directing  the Central\t Government to\tabolish\t the\ncontract labour\t system because under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 10</a> of the Act,\nParliament had\tvested in  the\tappropriate  Government\t the\npower to  prohibit the\temployment of contract labour in any\nprocess, operation  or any  other work in any establishment.\nThe  appropriate  Government  is  required  to\tconsult\t the\nCentral Board  or the State Board as the case may be, before\narriving at  its  decision.  The  decision,  of\t course,  is\nsubject to  the judicial  review. Hence, the Court would not\nbe justified  in issuing  a mandamus  prayed for  unless and\nuntil the Government failed or refused to exercise the power\nvested\tin   it\t under\t <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_71\">Section  10</a>  of  the  Act.

The Court  further observed that without waiting\nfor the\t decision of  the Central  Government, the  Southern\nRailway was  free of  its own motion to abolish the contract\nlabour\tsystem\t and  to  regularise  the  services  of\t the\nemployees in  the work\tof cleaning  catering establishments\nand  pantry  cars.  The\t Court\tfurther\t observed  that\t the\nadministration of  the Southern Railway should refrain until\nthe  decision  of  the\tCentral\t Government  from  employing\ncontract labour.  The Court  also directed  that the work of\ncleaning catering  establishments and  pantry cars should be\ndone departmentally  by employing  those  workmen  who\twere\npreviously employed by the contractors on the same wages and\nconditions of  work as\twere applicable to those engaged for\nthe same work by the Southern Railway.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1087622\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/1087622/\" id=\"a_73\">Dena Nath &amp; Ors. v.

These decisions  in unambiguous  terms  lay  down\tthat\nafter the coming into operation of the Act, the authority to\nabolish the  contract labour  is vested\t exclusively in\t the\nappropriate Government which has to take its decision in the\nmatter in  accordance with  the provisions  of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 10</a> of\nthe Act.  This conclusion  has\tbeen  arrived  at  in  these\ndecisions on  the interpretation  of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_85\">Section  10</a> of the Act.\nHowever, it  has to  be remembered  that  the  authority  to\nabolish the  contract labour  under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_86\">Section  10</a> of  the\t Act\ncomes into  play only where there exists a genuine contract.\nIn other  words, if  there is no genuine contract and the so\ncalled contract is sham or a camouflage to hide the reality,\nthe  said   provisions\tare   inapplicable.  When,  in\tsuch\ncircumstances, the  concerned workmen  raise  an  industrial\ndispute for  relief that  they should  be deemed  to be\t the\nemployees of  the  principal  employer,\t the  Court  or\t the\nindustrial adjudicator\twill have  jurisdiction to entertain\nthe  dispute   and  grant  the\tnecessary  relief.  In\tthis\nconnection, we\tmay refer  to the following decision of this\nCourt which  were also\trelied upon  by the  counsel for the\nworkmen.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">     In The  Standard-Vacuum Refining  Co. of  India Ltd. v.\nIts workmen  and others.  [supra], an industrial dispute was\nraised by  the workmen of the appellant-company with respect\nto the\tcontract labour employed by the company with respect\nto the\tcontract labour employed by the company for cleaning\nmaintenance work  at the refinery including the premises and\nplants belonging  to it.  The  workmen\tmade  a\t demand\t for\nabolition of  the contract  system and for absorbing workmen\nemployed through  the contractor into the regular service of\nthe company.  The matter  was referred\tfor adjudication  to\nindustrial Tribunal.  The company  objected to the reference\non the\tground [1] that it was incompetent inasmuch as there\nwas no dispute between it and the respondents and it was not\nopen to\t them to raise a dispute with respect to the workmen\nof some other employer, viz., the contractor, and [2] in any\ncase, it  was for  the company\tto decide  what was the best\nmethod of  carrying on\tits business  and the Tribunal could\nnot interfere  with that  function of  the  management.\t The\nTribunal held  that the\t reference was\tcompetent. It was of\nthe opinion  that the  work which was being done through the\ncontractor was\tnecessary for  the company to be done daily,\nthat doing  this work  through annual  contracts resulted in\ndeprivation of security of service and other benefits of the\nworkmen of the contractor and hence the contract system with\nrespect to  that work  should be  abolished. In appeal, this\nCourt held that the dispute raised was an industrial dispute\nwithin the  meaning of\t<a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_87\">section\t 2</a>  [k]\t of  the  <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_88\">Industrial\nDisputes  Act</a>  because\t[i]  the  respondent-workmen  had  a\ncommunity of  interest with  the workmen  of the contractor,\n[ii] they  had also  substantial interest  in  the  subject-\nmatter of  the dispute\tinasmuch as  the class to which they\nbelonged was  substantially affected  thereby, and [iii] the\ncompany could  give relief  in the matter. The Court further\nheld that  the\twork  in  question  was\t incidental  to\t the\nmanufacturing process  and was necessary for it and was of a\nperennial nature  which must be done every day. Such work is\ngenerally done\tby workmen  in the regular employment of the\nemployer and  there should be no difficulty in having direct\nworkmen for that kind of work. The matter would be different\nif the\twork was  of intermittent or temporary nature or was\nso little  that it would not be possible to employ full time\nworkmen for  the purpose.  While dealing with the contention\nthat the  Tribunal  should  not\t have  interfered  with\t the\nmanagement&#x27;s manner  of having\tits work  done in  the\tmost\neconomical and\tconvenient way\tthat it\t thought proper, and\nthat the  case in  question was\t not one  where the contract\nsystem was  a camouflage  and the workmen of the contractors\nwere really  the workmen of the company, the Court held that\nit may\tbe accepted  that the contractor in that case was an\nindependent person  and the system was genuine and there was\nno question  of the  company carrying on the work itself and\ncamouflaging it\t as if\tit was\tdone through  contractors in\norder to  pay less  to the  workmen. But  the fact  that the\ncontract  in  the  case\t was  a\t bona  fide  one  would\t not\nnecessarily mean  that it  should  not\tbe  touched  by\t the\nindustrial Tribunals. If the contract had been mala fide and\na cloak\t for suppressing  the fact  that  the  workmen\twere\nreally the  workmen of\tthe company, the Tribunal would have\nbeen justified\tin ordering  the company  to take  over\t the\nentire body  of workmen and treat it as its own workmen. But\nbecause the contract in the case was bona fide, the Tribunal\nhad not\t ordered the company to take over the entire body of\nworkmen. It had left to the company to decide for itself how\nmany workmen.  It had  left to\tthe company  to\t decide\t for\nitself how  many workmen it should employ and on what terms,\nand had\t merely directed  that when selection is being made,\npreference  be\t given\tto   the  workmen  employed  by\t the\ncontractor. The\t Court also  held that the only question for\ndecision was  whether the  work which was perennial and must\ngo on from day to day and which was incidental and necessary\nfor the\t work of the refinery and was sufficient to employ a\nconsiderable number  of whole-time  workmen  and  which\t was\nbeing done  in most  concerns through direct workmen, should\nbe allowed to be done by contractors. Considering the nature\nof the\twork done and the conditions of service in the case,\nthe Court  opined that the Tribunal&#x27;s decision was right and\nno interference was called for.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">     This decision is of seminal importance for two reasons.\nIt laid\t down the tests for deciding whether contract labour\nshould\tbe   continued\tin   a\t particular   establishment,\noccupation  or\t process  etc.\t <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_89\">Section  10</a>   of  the\t Act\nincorporates more  or less  the same  tests as\tlaid down by\nthis decision. Secondly, it also spelt out the circumstances\nwhen the  workmen of  an establishment can espouse the cause\nof other  workmen who  were not\t the direct employees of the\nestablishment and  raise an  industrial dispute\t within\t the\nmeaning of the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_90\">ID Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">     This being\t a case\t decided prior\tto the\tcoming\tinto\noperation of  the Act,\tthe Court has held here that even if\nthe contract  is a  genuine one,  the industrial adjudicator\nwill have  jurisdiction to  abolish the\t contract labour and\ngive appropriate  relief as the industrial Tribunal had done\nin the\tcase. Its  importance lies in the fact that it lends\nsupport to  the proposition  that even after the coming into\noperation of  the Act, the industrial adjudicator will have,\nin appropriate\tcases, jurisdiction  to\t investigate  as  to\nwhether the  contract is  genuine or not, and if he comes to\nthe conclusion\tthat it\t is not,  he will  have jurisdiction\nalso to\t give suitable\trelief. It may also appear that even\nwhere the  contract is\tgenuine but is comes to be abolished\nby the\tappropriate Government\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 10</a> of the Act,\nthe  industrial\t  adjudicator  will   have  jurisdiction  to\ndetermine  the\tstatus\tof  the\t workmen  of  the  erstwhile\ncontractor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"642607\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/642607/\" id=\"a_92\">Hussainbhai, Calicut v. The Alath Factory Thozhilali\nUnion, Kozhikode  &amp; Ors.</a>  [(1978) 4  SCC 257],\ta number  of\nworkmen were  engaged in  the petitioner&#x27;s  factory to\tmake\nropes. But  they were  hired by contractors who had executed\nagreements with\t the petitioners to get such work done. When\n29 of  these workmen  were denied  employment, an industrial\ndispute was referred by the State Government. The Industrial\nTribunal held  them to\tbe workmen  of the  petitioner. This\naward was challenged by the petitioner before the High Court\nand the\t learned Single\t Judge held  that the petitioner was\nthe employer  and  the\tworkmen\t were  employees  under\t the\npetitioner. The Division Bench of the High Court upheld this\ndecision.  While   dismissing  the  special  leave  petition\nagainst <a href=\"/doc/642607/\" id=\"a_93\">the  said decision</a>,  this Court\t observed  that\t the\nfacts found  were that\tthe work  done by the workmen was an\nintegral part  of the  industry concerned.  The raw material\nwas  supplied\tby  the\t management,  the  factory  premises\nbelonged to the management, the equipment used also belonged\nto the\tmanagement and the finished product was taken by the\nmanagement for its own trade. The workmen were broadly under\nthe control  of the  management and  the defective  articles\nwere directed  to be  rectified\t by  the  management.  These\ncircumstances were conclusive to prove that the workmen were\nworkmen of  the petitioner.  The <a href=\"/doc/642607/\" id=\"a_94\">Court\tfurther held</a> that if\nthe livelihood\tof  the\t workmen  substantially\t depends  on\nlabour rendered\t to  produce  goods  and  services  for\t the\nbenefit and  satisfaction of  the enterprise, the absence of\ndirect\t relationship\t or   the    presence\tof   dubious\nintermediaries cannot  snap the\t real life bond. If however,\nthere is  total dissociation  between the management and the\nworkmen, the employer is in substance and in real life terms\nanother. The  true test\t is where  the workers\tor group  of\nworkers labour\tto produce goods or services and these goods\nor services are for the business of another, that another is\nin fact,  the employer.\t He has\t economic control  over\t the\nworkers&#x27; skill,\t subsistence, and  continued employment.  If\nfor any\t reason, he  chokes off,  the workers  are virtually\nlaid off. The presence of intermediate contractors with whom\nalone the  workers have\t immediate or direct relationship ex\ncontractu is  of no  consequence when on lifting the veil or\nlooking at  the conspectus  of factors governing employment,\nthe naked  truth is discerned and especially since it is one\nof the\tmyriad devices\tresorted to  by the  managements  to\navoid responsibility  when labour  legislation casts welfare\nobligations on\treal employer  based on <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_95\">Articles 38</a><a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_96\">, 39</a><a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_97\">, 42</a><a href=\"/doc/1256023/\" id=\"a_98\">,\n43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/118693005/\" id=\"a_99\">43A [</a>sic.] of the Constitution.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1071315\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/1071315/\" id=\"a_100\">R.K.

They were continuing in employment for\nperiods ranging from 10 to 20 years. The contractors used to\nbe changed  but the  new contractors were under the terms of\nthe  agreement\t required  to  retain  the  workers  of\t the\npredecessor contractors.  The workers  were employed through\nthe contractors for different purposes like construction and\nmaintenance of\troads and  buildings within  plant premises,\npublic\thealth,\t horticulture,\twater  supply  etc.  In\t the\nagreement with\tthe contractors,  it  was  stated  that\t the\nparties shall  be governed  by the  provisions of the Act as\nwell as\t by the\t provisions of\tthe payment of <a href=\"/doc/720619/\" id=\"a_102\">Bonus Act</a>. On\nthese facts, this Court observed as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t &quot;It is\t true that  with the passage\n     of\t time  and  purely  with  a  view  to\n     safeguard the interests of workers, many\n     principal employers  while renewing  the\n     contracts have  been insisting  that the\n     contractor or the new contractor retains\n     the  old\temployees.  In\tfact  such  a\n     condition\t is   incorporated   in\t  the\n     contract itself.  However, such a clause\n     in the  contract which  is\t benevolently\n     inserted in  the contract to protect the\n     continuance of  the source of livelihood\n     of the  contract labour cannot by itself\n     give rise\tto a  right to regularisation\n     in\t the   employment  of  the  principal\n     employer. Whether the contract labourers\n     have  become   the\t employees   of\t  the\n     principal employer in course of time and\n     whether the engagement and employment of\n     labourers through a contractor is a mere\n     camouflage and  a\tsmokescreen,  as  has\n     been urged\t in this  case, is a question\n     of fact and has to be established by the\n     contract labourers\t on the\t basis of the\n     requisite material.  It is\t not possible\n     for the  High Court or this Court, while\n     exercising\t   writ\t   jurisdiction\t   or\n     jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 136</a> to decide\n     such questions, only on the basis of the\n     affidavits. It  need not  be pointed out\n     that in  all such\tcases, the  labourers\n     are initially  employed and  engaged  by\n     the contractors.  As such\tat what point\n     of time  a direct\tlink  is  established\n     between the  contract labourers  and the\n     principal\temployer,   eliminating\t  the\n     contractor from  the scene,  is a matter\n     which has\tto be established on material\n     produced before the court. Normally, the\n     Labour   Court    and   the   Industrial\n     Tribunal, under  the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_104\">Industrial Disputes\n     Act</a> are the competent fora to adjudicate\n     such disputes  on the  basis of the oral\n     and documentary evidence produced before\n     them.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1071315\" id=\"span_11\">Taking into  consideration the  developments during the\npendency of  the writ  petition in  this Court and the offer\nmade by\t the respondent-authority  to the  workmen either to\naccept voluntary retirement on the terms offered by it or to\nagree to  be absorbed  on regular  basis and  the scheme  of\nmodernisation which  was in  the process  of implementation,\nthe Court  gave certain directions in respect of 879 workmen\nwho were  involved <a href=\"/doc/1071315/\" id=\"a_105\">in  that case</a>.

It is  not necessary  for us to go into the question of\nthe finality  of the  decision under  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 10</a>  of the Act\nsince as  held by  this Court in <a href=\"/doc/462941/\" id=\"a_116\">Vegoils Pvt.

However, as stated earlier, the\nexclusive jurisdiction\tof the\tappropriate Government under\n<a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 10</a>  of the Act arises only where the labour contract\nis genuine and the question whether the contract is genuine,\nor not\tcan be examined and adjudicated upon by the court or\nthe industrial\tadjudicator, as\t the case  may be.  Hence in\nsuch cases,  the workmen  can make a grievance that there is\nno genuine  contract and that they are in fact the employees\nof the principal employer.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">14.  It is  no doubt true that neither <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 10</a> of the Act\nnor any\t other provision  thereof provides for determination\nof the\tstatus of  the workmen\tof the\terstwhile contractor\nonce  the  appropriate\tGovernment  abolishes  the  contract\nlabour. In  fact, on  the abolition  of\t the  contract,\t the\nworkmen are  in a  worse condition since they can neither be\nemployed by  the contractor nor is there any obligation cast\non  the\t  principal  employer\tto  engage   them   in\t his\nestablishment. We  find that  this is  a vital lacuna in the\nAct. Although  the Act\thas been  placed on the statute book\nwith all benevolent intentions, and elaborate provisions are\nmade to\t prevent the  abuse of the contract labour system as\nis evident from the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the\nprovisions of  the Act\treferred to by us in detail earlier,\nthe  legislature   has\tnot  provided  any  relief  for\t the\nconcerned workmen  after  the  contract\t is  abolished.\t One\nreason for  the same  pointed out to us was that the workmen\nengaged by the contractor may not be qualified to be engaged\nby the principal employer according to the latter&#x27;s rules of\nrecruitment. In\t this respect,\twe  envisage  two  different\nsituations, first  where  similar  type\t of  work  is  being\ncarried\t out  by  the  direct  employees  of  the  principal\nemployer and, second where the contract labour is engaged to\nexecute work  which is\tnot being carried out by any section\nof the\tdirect\temployees  of  the  principal  employer.  As\nregards the  first situation,  the condition  no. [5] of the\nlicence to  be granted\tto the\tcontractor in  Form VI under\nRule 25 [1] of the Rules requires that wage rates, holidays,\nhours of  work\tand  other  conditions\tof  service  of\t the\ncontract workmen  shall be  the same  as applicable  to\t the\nworkmen directly  employed by  the  principal  employer\t for\nperforming the same or similar type of work. In other cases,\nthe wage rates, holidays, hours of work and other conditions\nof  service  of\t the  workmen  of  the\tcontractor,  as\t per\ncondition [6]  of the  said Form,  shall be  such as  may be\nspecified by  the Chief\t Labour Commissioner [Central]. When\nthe  legislature  has  been  careful  enough  to  take\tsuch\nprecautions, we\t are unable to appreciate as to why it could\nnot have provided also for the absorption of the workmen who\nhave been  doing the  work in  question. It is possible that\nthe contractor\thas been  transferring his  workmen from one\njob to\tanother and  the same workmen may not be working for\nall the\t time in  the same establishment or the process. But\nas pointed  out earlier,  the application  for\tregistration\nunder Rule  17 [1],  the certificate  of registration  under\nRule 18\t [1], the  register of\testablishment under  Rule 18\n[3], the  application for  licence under Rule 21 [1] and the\nlicence\t granted   under  Rule\t 25  [1]   all\trequire\t the\nparticulars of\tcontract  labour  to  be  furnished  in\t the\nprescribed form.  Hence is should not be difficult to verify\nthe workmen  who were  actually working in the establishment\nin question  for a  given period  of time and the period for\nwhich they  had worked\tsince the record of payment of wages\nmade to\t them would  be available as it is to be made in the\npresence of the representative of the principal employer who\nis also\t responsible to make the payment of the whole of the\nwages or  the balance  of it  in case  the contractor  makes\ndefault. For ensuring the payment to the workmen, the muster\nroll has  necessarily to be maintained. If they have in fact\nworked for  a reasonably  long time  satisfactorily and have\nthus gained  experience,  it  should  not  be  difficult  to\nidentify and  absorb them.  In fact,  they will\t any time be\nbetter than  fresh recruits  and their\tengagement would  be\nbeneficial to the establishment concerned. On account of the\nabolition of  the contract labour, the establishment will in\nany case  require replacement of the contract labour. It may\nbe  that   the\testablishment  may  not\t require  the  whole\ncomplement  of\t the  workmen\terstwhile  employed  by\t the\ncontractor. But\t that also  may not  always be correct since\nthe contractor\twould more  probably than  not have employed\nless work-force\t than may  be necessary in order to keep his\nmargin of profit as wide as possible. Whatever the case, the\nlogic  in   not\t employing  the\t workmen  of  the  erstwhile\ncontractor or  those of\t them who  may be  necesary, in\t the\nprincipal establishment\t after the  contract  is  abolished,\ndoes not appear to be sound.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">     The legislature  probably did not consider it advisable\nto  make   a  provision\t for  automatic\t absorption  of\t the\nerstwhile contract  labour in the principal establishment on\nthe abolition  of the  contract labour,\t fearing  that\tsuch\nprovision would amount to forcing the contract labour on the\nprincipal employer  and making\ta contract between them. The\nindustrial adjudicator\thowever is  not\t inhibited  by\tsuch\nconsiderations.\t He  has  the  jurisdiction  to\t change\t the\ncontractual  relationships   and  also\tmake  new  contracts\nbetween the  employer and the employees under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_119\">ID Act</a>. It\nis for\tthis reason  that in  all cases\t where the  contract\nlabour is  abolished, the  industrial adjudicator, depending\nupon the facts of the case will have the authority to direct\nthe principal  employer to absorb such of the workmen of the\nerstwhile contractor  and on  such terms as he may determine\non the\tbasis of the relevant material before him. Hence the\nlegislature could  have provided  in the  Act itself  for  a\nireference of  the dispute  with regard to the absorption of\nthe workmen  of the  erstwhile contractor  to the industrial\nadjudictor after  the appropriate  Government has  abolished\nthe contract  labour. That would also have obviated the need\nto  sponsor  the  dispute  by  the  direct  workmen  of\t the\nprincipal employer.  That can  still be\t done by  a suitable\namendment of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">15.  The answer\t to the\t question as  to what  would be\t the\nstatus of  the erstwhile workmen of the contractor, once the\ncontract labour\t system is abolished is therefore that where\nan industrial  dispute is  raised, the status of the workmen\nwill be\t as determined by the industrial adjudicator. If the\ncontract labour\t system is  abolished while  the  industrial\nadjudication is\t pending or is kept pending on the concerned\ndispute, the  adjudicator can  give direction in that behalf\nin the\tpending dispute.  If, however, no industrial dispute\nis pending  for determination of the issue, nothing prevents\nan industrial dispute being raised for the purpose.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">16.  The last but equally important question that remains to\nbe answered  is :  who can  raise an  industrial dispute for\nabsorption of  the workmen  of the  ex-\t contractor  by\t the\nprincipal employer.  As has been pointed out earlier, if the\ncontract is  not genuine,  the\tworkmen\t of  the  contractor\nthemselves can\traise such  dispute, since  in raising\tsuch\ndispute the  workmen concerned\twould be  proceeding on\t the\nbasis that  they are  in fact  the workmen  of the principal\nemployer and  not of the contractor. Hence the dispute would\nsquarely fall  within the  definition of  industrial dispute\nunder <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_120\">Section  2 (k)</a>  of the  ID Act being a dispute between\nthe employer  and the  employees. In  that case, the dispute\nwould not  be for  abolition of the contract labour, but for\nsecuring  the\tappropriate  service   conditions  from\t the\nprincipal employer on the footing that the workmen concerned\nwere always the employees of the principal employer and they\nwere denied  their dues.  In such a dispute, the workmen are\nrequired to establish that the so called labour contract was\nsham and was only a camouflage to deny them their legitimate\ndues.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">     However, the  situation is obviously different when the\nlabour contract\t is genuine  and there is no relationship of\nemployer-employee between  the principal  employer  and\t the\nworkmen of  the contractor.  No industrial  dispute  can  be\nraised by  the workmen\tof the\tcontractor either  before or\nafter the  contract labour  is abolished  by the appropriate\nGovernment under  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 10</a>  of the  Act.  This  hurdle  in\nraising the  dispute will  however disappear if it is raised\nby the direct workmen of the principal employer who have (i)\na community  of interest  with the  contract labour,  (ii) a\nsubstantial interest  in the  subject matter  of the dispute\nand (iii)  when the employer can grant the relief as is held\nin the following decisions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1198151\" id=\"span_16\">In <a href=\"/doc/1198151/\" id=\"a_122\">Workmen of Dimakuchi Tea Estate v.

The dispute in this case is\n     that the  company should  employ workmen\n     directly and  not through contractors in\n     carrying on its work and this dispute is\n     undoubtedly real  and  substantial\t even\n     though the\t regular workmen  (i.e.,  the\n     respondents) who  have raised it are not\n     employed\ton    contract\t labour.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1198151\" id=\"span_19\">In\n     <a href=\"/doc/1198151/\" id=\"a_139\">Dimakuchi</a> case  to which  reference  has\n     been made,\t the dispute  was relating to\n     an employee  of the  tea estate  who was\n     not a  workmen.

We  do  not  think  it\n     necessary to  go into this aspect of the\n     matter as we have already indicated that\n     prejudicial effect\t is only  one of  the\n     illustrations    of     the    practical\n     application of  the test  <a href=\"/doc/1198151/\" id=\"a_146\">laid  down  in</a>\n     <a href=\"/doc/1198151/\" id=\"a_147\">Dimakuchi</a>\t case,\t  viz.,\t  substantial\n     interest in  the sense that the class to\n     which the\taggrieved  party  belongs  is\n     substantially affected thereby.

The  answer  to  the\tlast\nquestion, viz.,\t who can raise an industrial dispute for the\npurpose of  absorption of  the contractor&#x27;s  labour  in\t the\nprincipal establishment is, therefore, as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">     If the  workmen of the so called contractor allege that\nin fact\t the contract  is sham\tand they  are  in  fact\t the\nworkmen of  the\t principal  employer,  they  may  raise\t the\ndispute themselves  not for abolition of the contract labour\nsystem, but  for making\t available to  them the\t appropriate\nservice conditions.  When such\tdispute is raised, it is not\nfor abolition  of the contract labour, but for a declaration\nthat the  workmen concerned are in fact the employees of the\nprincipal employer,  and for  consequential reliefs  on such\ndeclaration. If however, the contract is genuine, the direct\nworkmen of the principal employer may espouse the industrial\ndispute for  abolition of the contract labour system and for\nabsorption of the contractor&#x27;s workmen as the direct workmen\nof the\tprincipal employer.  When such\tdispute is raised by\nthe direct workmen of the principal employer, the industrial\nadjudicator can\t entertain the reference; but in view of the\nprovisions of  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 10</a>  of the Act, he will have first to\ndirect the  workmen to\tapproach the  appropriate Government\nfor considering\t the question  as to  whether  the  contract\nlabour in  question should  or should not be abolished under\nthe said provisions. If, on such reference being made by the\nworkmen, the  appropriate Government  does not\tabolish\t the\ncontract labour,  the industrial  adjudicator has  to reject\nthe reference since the jurisdiction to abolish the contract\nis exclusively\tvested in  the appropriate Government and he\nhas no\tjurisdiction to\t adjudicate the dispute. However, if\nthe appropriate\t Government abolishes  the contract  labour,\nthe industrial\tadjudicator can\t proceed to decide (i) as to\nwhether the  erstwhile contract labour should be absorbed in\nthe principal  establishment; (ii) if so, to what extent and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(iii) on  what terms.  The decision on the points, will have\nto be  given by\t him by giving opportunity to the parties to\nlead the necessary evidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">18.\t Our conclusions and answers to the questions raised\nare, therefore, as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">[i] In\tview of the the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 10</a> of the Act,\nit  is\t only  the  appropriate\t Government  which  has\t the\nauthority to  abolish genuine  labour contract in accordance\nwith the  provisions of the said Section. No Court including\nthe industrial adjudicator has jurisdiction to do so.\n[ii] if\t the contract is sham or not genuine, the workmen of\nthe so called contractor can raise an industrial dispute for\ndeclaring  that\t they  were  always  the  employess  of\t the\nprincipal employer  and for claiming the appropriate service\nconditions. When such dispute is raised, it is not a dispute\nfor  abolition\t of  the   labour  contract  and  hence\t the\nprovisions of  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 10</a> of the Act will not bar either the\nraising or  the\t adjudication  of  the\tdispute.  When\tsuch\ndispute is  raised, the industrial adjudicator has to decide\nwhether the  contract is  sham or genuine. It is only if the\nadjudicator comes  to the  conclusion that  the contract  is\nsham, that  he will  have  jurisdiction\t to  adjudicate\t the\ndispute. If,  however, he  comes to  the conclusion that the\ncontract is  genuine,  he  may\trefer  the  workmen  to\t the\nappropriate Government\tfor abolition of the contract labour\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_153\">Section  10</a> of  the Act  and keep the dispute pending.\nHowever, he  can do  so if  the dispute\t is espoused  by the\ndirect workmen\tof the principal employer. If the workmen of\nthe principal  employer have  not espoused  the dispute, the\nadjudicator,  after   coming  to  the  conclusion  that\t the\ncontract is  genuine,  has  to\treject\tthe  reference,\t the\ndispute being  not an  industrial dispute within the meaning\nof <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_154\">Section  2 (k)</a> of the ID Act. He will not be competent to\ngive any  relief to  the workmen of the erstwhile contractor\neven if\t the labour contract is abolished by the appropriate\nGovernment under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 10</a> of the Act.\n[iii]  If   the\t labour\t contract  is  genuine\ta  composite\nindustrial dispute  can still be raised for abolition of the\ncontract labour\t and their absorption. However, the dispute,\nwill have to be raised invariably by the direct employees of\nthe principal  employer. The  industrial adjudicator,  after\nreceipt of  the reference of such dispute will have first to\ndirect the  workmen to\tapproach the  appropriate Government\nfor abolition of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 10</a> of the\nAct and\t keep the  reference pending.  If pursuant  to\tsuch\nreference,  the\t  contract  labour   is\t abolished   by\t the\nappropriate Government, the industrial adjudicator will have\nto give\t opportunity to\t the parties  to place the necessary\nmaterial before\t him to\t decide whether\t the workmen  of the\nerstwhile contractor  should be\t directed to  be absorbed by\nthe principal  employer, how many of them and on what terms.\nIf, however,  the contract  labour  is\tnot  abolished,\t the\nindustrial adjudicator has to reject the reference.\n[iv] Even after the contract labour system is abolished, the\ndirect employees  of the  principal employer  can  raise  an\nindustrial dispute  for absorption  of\tthe  ex-contractor&#x27;s\nworkmen and  the adjudicator  on the  material placed before\nhim can\t decide as to who and how many of the workmen should\nbe absorbed and on what terms.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">19.  It is  in the  light of the above position of law which\nemerges from  the provisions  of the  Act and  the  judicial\ndecisions  on  the  subject  that  we  have  to\t answer\t the\ncontentions raised  in different civil appeals before us. As\nregards the  present civil  appeal, the\t facts of which have\nalready\t been  referred\t to  earlier,  Shri  Venugopal,\t the\nlearned counsel for the appellant- Board contended that none\nof the direct workmen of the Board had espoused the cause of\nthe  contract\tlabour\tand   hence  the   Tribunal  had  no\njurisdiction to\t entertain the\treference. He also submitted\nthat any amount of consent by the appellant-Board for such a\nreference will\tnot confer  jurisdiciton on  the Tribunal to\nentertain the reference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">     As has been pointed out earlier, the order of reference\nof the\tdispute to  the\t Tribunal  was\tmade  by  the  State\nGovernment on the basis of a joint application for reference\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1871842/\" id=\"a_157\">Section  10(2)</a> of the ID Act. The application was duly\nsigned\tby   the  present  appellant-Board,  all  the  seven\ncontractors involved  in the  dispute and  by the then Surat\nLabour Union  which had\t both direct  as  well\tas  contract\nlabourers, as  its  members.  The  respondent-union  is\t the\nsuccessor of  the said\tSurat Labour Union. These facts show\ntwo things,  viz., that\t contrary to  the submission made by\nthe learned  counsel, the  direct employees of the Board had\nespoused the  cause  of\t the  contract\tlabourers,  and\t the\nappellant-Board had  also accepted the fact that the dispute\nin question  was raised\t and  supported\t also  by  the\tsaid\nemployees. No objection was taken before the Tribunal or the\nHigh Court  either to  the order  of  reference\t or  to\t the\nadjudication of the dispute by the Tribunal that the dispute\nwas not\t espoused by  the direct employees of the appellant-\nBoard. This  would also\t show that the fact that the dispute\nwas espoused  by the  direct  employees\t of  the  Board\t was\naccepted by  the Board\tand never questioned till this date.\nApart from  the fact,  therefore, that\tthe Board had signed\nthe joint  application for reference and therefore it cannot\nin an  appeal by  special leave\t under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_158\">Article\t136</a>  of\t the\nConstitution for  the first time raise the question which is\na mixed\t question of  law and  fact, we are of the view that\neven on\t facts as  they stand,\tit will have to be held that\nthe dispute  was in fact espoused by the direct employees of\nthe  appellant-Board.\tWe   therefore\t reject\t  the\tsaid\ncontention.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">20. It\twas next  contended that  the dispute  raised by the\nworkmen was for abolition of the contract and such a dispute\ncould not  have been  entertained by the Tribunal in view of\nthe provisions\tof <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_159\">Section  10</a> of the Act. For this purpose,\nthe learned  counsel relied  upon clause (1) of the order of\nReference. We find nothing in the said clause which supports\nthe contention\tof the\tlearned counsel. The clause reads as\nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">\t &quot;Whether the workers whose services\n     are engaged  by the contractors, but who\n     are working in the Thermal Power Station\n     of Gujarat\t Electricity Board  at\tUkai,\n     can legally claim to be the employees of\n     the Gujarat Electricity Board?&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">It will\t be obvious  from a  reading of the said clause that\nwhat  in   fact\t is   referred\tfor   adjudication  is\t the\ndetermination of  the status  of the  workmen, viz., whether\nthough engaged\tby the\tcontractors, they  are\tlegally\t the\nworkmen of  the appellant-Board? In other words, implicit in\nthe said  clause is  the assertion  of the workmen that they\nare in law the workmen of the appellant-Board and not of the\ncontractors, and  they wanted  the Tribunal  to decide their\nexact legal status. This is clear from also the statement of\nclaim filed  by the  workmen in\t support of their demand. In\nparagraph 3  of the  statement of  claim, it is averred that\nthe Board  has been  employing Mukadam\tsupervisors &quot;who are\ndraped in  different paper arrangements and are now known as\ncontractors of\tthe Thermal Power Station&quot; and the Board and\nthe  so-called\t contractors  have  joined  hands  for\tmass\nvictimisation  and  termination\t of  services  even  without\npayment of due wages. Again, in paragraph 5 of the statement\nof claim, it is stated that the workmen are being paid wages\nby the\tmanagement of  the Board through Mukadam supervisors\nnow known  as contractors of the Board. The contractors come\nand go\tbut the\t workmen are  working throughout  since\t the\ninception  of\tthe  Thermal  Power  Station.  The  control,\ndirection and  initiation of  these workmen are in the hands\nof the\tsupervisors and technical staff fo the Thermal Power\nStation. It  is also  alleged in the said paragraph that the\nso-called contractors  are not\tthe contractors\t as none  of\nthem have taken licence. It is also averred there that it is\nabundantly clear  that the  workmen employed  to perform the\npermanent and  perennial nature\t of duties are the employees\nof the\tBoard. In paragraph 10 of the statement of claim, it\nis prayed that the Tribunal should hold and declare that the\nworkers deployed in the Thermal Power Station under the garb\nof contractor  are the\tpermanent employees  of the  Thermal\nPower Station  managed\tand  controlled\t by  the  appellant-\nBoard&quot;. In paragraph 6 of the application for interim relief\nwhich was  filed on  behalf of\tthe workmen,  it was averred\nthat the  Board was  though different agreements showing the\nworkmen as  if they  were working  under some intermediaries\nand the said intermediaries are &quot;make-believe trappings&quot; and\nare &quot;dubious&quot;  in nature  and it  was only  to\tdeprive\t the\nworkmen of the benefits which are available to the employees\nof the\tBoard that  the said  &quot;make-believe trappings&quot;\twere\nemployed by  the Board.\t It is\ttherefore not correct to say\nthat the  present reference  was for  the abolition  of\t the\ncontract. The  reference  on  the  other  hand,\t was  for  a\ndeclaration that  the workmen  were in\tfact and  in law the\nemployees of  the appellant-Board  and that  they should  be\ngiven the  service conditions as are available to the direct\nemployees of the Board.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1087622\" id=\"span_24\">It was  then contended  by the learned counsel that the\nIndustrial Tribunal  has nowhere recorded a finding that the\ncontract in question was sham, camouflage, make-believe or a\nsubterfuge. On\tthe contrary, according to him, the Tribunal\nhas held that the contract labour of each of the contractors\nmust be\t deemed to  be the employees of the appellant-Board,\nfirstly because\t the  Board  and  the  contractors  had\t not\nproduced valid proof of the registration certificate and the\nlicences respectively,\trelying\t on  the  decisions  of\t the\nMadras and  Karnataka High  Courts, and secondly, because of\nthe nature  of the  work. He submitted that the decisions of\nthe Madras  and Karnataka  High Courts\thave been  expressly\noverruled by  this Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/1087622/\" id=\"a_160\">Dena  Nath</a>  case\t[supra].  As\nregards the  nature of\twork, the  exclusive jurisdiction to\nrecord a  finding in  that  behalf  is\tof  the\t appropriate\nGovernment under  <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 10</a>  of the Act and the Tribunal is\nprecluded from\trecording  a  finding  in  that\t behalf\t and\nabolishing the\tcontract on  the basis\tof such\t finding. In\nfact, the  Tribunal  has  no  jurisdiction  to\tabolish\t the\ncontract.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"642607\" id=\"span_25\">In the first instance, we find that the contention that\nthe Tribunal  has held\tthat the workmen in question are the\nemployees of the Board only because of the non-production of\nthe valid  proof of  the certificate  and  the\tlicences  in\nquestion, is  not correct. The Tribunal has, on the basis of\nthe evidence  on record,  come\tto  the\t conclusions,  among\nothers, that  (i) the work was being done on the premises of\nthe Board itself as the coal was being used for the purposes\nof the\tBoard, viz.,  generation of  electricity;  (ii)\t the\nworkmen were  broadly under  the control of the Board; (iii)\nthere was overall supervision of the work by the officers of\nthe Board;  (iv) the work was of a continuous nature and (v)\nthe work  was an  integral part\t of the\t overall work  to be\nexecuted  for\tthe  purposes\tof  the\t generation  of\t the\nelectricity and that it had to be performed within specified\ntime limits  as part of the integrated process. The Tribunal\nhas also  in this  connection referred to a decision of this\nCourt reprted  in <a href=\"/doc/642607/\" id=\"a_162\">Hussainbhai,\tCalicut</a> case  [(1978) 4\t SCC\n257]  to  support  its\tconclusion  that  in  the  aforesaid\ncircumstacnes found  by it, the workmen in question were the\nemployees of the Board. It is true that the Tribunal has not\nin so  many words  recorded a  finding that the contract was\nsham or\t bogus or a camouflage to conceal the real facts. It\nis also true that the Tribunal has referred to the decisions\nof the\tMadras and  Karnataka High Courts and on its finding\nthat the  Board and  the contractors  had not produced valid\nproof of  the registration  certificate and the licences for\nthe relevant  period has  held that  the workmen  should  be\ndeemed to  be the  employees  of  the  Board.  However,\t the\ndecision of  the Tribunal  has to  be read  as a whole. Thus\nread, the  decision makes  it clear  that the  Tribunal\t has\nbased its  conclusion both  on the  ground that\t the workmen\nwere in\t fact engaged  by the appellant-Board and not by the\ncontractors who\t were merely  intermediaries set  up by\t the\nBoard and  also on  the ground that there was no valid proof\nof the\tregistration certificate  and the  licences  in\t the\npossession of the Board and the contractors respectively. It\nis not,\t therefore, correct  to say that the decision of the\nTribunal is  based only\t on the latter ground. We are of the\nview that  there  is  a\t factual  finding  recorded  by\t the\nTribunal that  the labour  contracts in\t question  were\t not\ngenuine and  the decision  of the  Tribunal is based on this\nground as well.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">     It is  also not  correct to  say that  to arrive at the\nfinding as  to whether\tthe labour  contracts are genuine or\nnot,  the   Court  or\tthe  industrial\t adjudicator  cannot\ninvestigate the factors mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1737494/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 2 (a)</a> to (d) of\n<a href=\"/doc/1871842/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 10(2)</a>  of the  Act. The explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1871842/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 10(2)</a>\nmakes the  decision of the appropriate Government final only\non the question whether the process or operation or the work\nin question  is of  a perennial\t nature or not, and that too\nwhen a\tdispute arises\twith regard  to the same. If no such\nquestion arises,  the finding  recorded by  the Court or the\nTribunal in  that behalf  is  not  ineffective\tor  invalid.\nFurther, in  all such  cases, the Tribunal is called upon to\nrecord\ta  finding  on\tthe  factors  in  question  not\t for\nabolishing the contract but to find out whether the contract\nis sham or otherwise. The contract may be genuine even where\nall the\t said factors  are present.  What is  prohibited  by\n<a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 10</a>  is the  abolition of  the contract except by the\nappropriate Government,\t after taking into consideration the\nsaid factors,  and not\tthe recording  of the finding on the\nbasis of  the said  factors, that  the contract\t is sham  or\nbogus.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">21. The\t next contention  of the  learned counsel  that\t the\nreference with\tregard to  the\tabolition  of  the  contract\nlabour was  not maintainable  after the coming into force of\nthe Act\t has been  sufficiently answered by us earlier while\ndiscussing and\trecording our conclusions on the position of\nlaw in\tthat behalf. Even on facts, we have pointed out that\nthe present  reference was not for the abolition of contract\nlabour but  for a  declaration that  the workmen were in law\nthe  employees\t of  the   appellant-Board.  The  industrial\nadjudicator has\t undoubtedly no\t jurisdiction to  abolish  a\ngenuine labour contract in view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_167\">Section\n10</a> of  the Act.\t However, it  is not correct to say that the\nreference for  the abolition  of the contract, itself stands\nbarred.\t It  is\t the  terms  of\t the  reference\t which\twill\ndetermine the  jurisdiction of the industrial adjudicator to\nenetertain and\tdecide the  reference.\tThe  dispute  as  to\nwhether the  labour  contract  is  genuine  or\tnot  can  be\nagitated by  the workmen  and the industrial adjudicator has\njurisdiction to\t examine the controversy. If the contract is\nheld to\t be genuine,  the dispute  if it  is espoused by the\ndirect workmen of the principal employer can be kept pending\nby  the\t industrial  adjudicator  and  the  workmen  may  be\nreferred by  him  to  the  appropriate\tGovernment  for\t the\nabolition of  the contract.  If the  appropriate  Government\nabolishes  the\tcontract,  the\tindustrial  adjudicator\t can\nthereafter grant  futher relief,  if claimed,  viz., of\t the\nabsorption of the workmen of the erstwhile contractor in the\nprincipal  establishment.   If,\t however,   the\t appropriate\nGovernment does\t not abolsih  the contract,  the  industrial\nadjudicator may\t reject the reference, as stated earlier. It\nis not,\t therefore, correct  to say that the reference of an\nindustrial dispute seeking to abolish the contract is per se\nbarred, as contented by the learned counsel.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"653552\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"180120\" id=\"span_27\">22.

Their workmen (supra), the facts were that the\nappellant  company  carried  on\t business  of  Inland  Water\nTransport in north-east India between various river stations\nin Bengal  and Assam  and for  this purpose, it maintained a\nnumber of  ghats or  stations on  the river  Brahmaputra  in\nAssam. The  company did not employ any workmen at any of the\nriver stations\tfor the\t work of cargo-handling and left all\nsuch  work   to\t be   carried  on   by\tdifferent   handling\ncontractors. On 3rd May, 1954, an agreement was entered into\nbetween the company and its allied companies on the one hand\nand the\t Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) on the\nother. The  agreement was that a tripartite conference would\nbe held later to decide the question of direct employment of\nworkmen by  the company. The said conference was held on 9th\nand 10th May, 1954 at which the company agreed that it would\nprogressively introduce\t the system  of direct employment of\nlabour in  all transhipment  ghats  in\tAssam.\tAccordingly,\ndirect labour  was employed  by the  company in\t some of the\nmajor ghats,  but in  the smaller  ghats  the  old  contract\nlabour\tcontinued.  On\t29th  April,  1957,  a\tconciliation\nmeeting was held to consider the demand made by the Sibsagar\nTranshipment Labour  Union for\tdirect employment of workmen\nat three  minor ghats. No decision was, however, reached and\nthe contract  labour continued\tto work\t at the\t said ghats.\nAnother tripartite  meeting was\t held on 10th November, 1959\nand it\twas then agreed that the company would employ direct\nlabour in  all the  ghats on  or  before  1st  April,  1960.\nMeanwhile, a  material change  in the  circumstances of\t the\ncompany&#x27;s working took place in one sector of its operation.\nThe company made arrangements to open a ghat in May, 1960 as\nan all-the-year-round  main-line ghat  replacing the current\nfeeder service\toperation. This\t step  represented  a  major\nadvance in  the improvement of transport facilities and also\nled to the closure of one of the ghats on 17th May, 1960. As\na result,  56 workmen  involved in the dispute in the appeal\nbefore the  Court, came\t to be\tdischarged by payment of one\nmonth&#x27;s basic  pay. On\tthese facts,  the dispute raised was\nwhether the  termination of  the services  of the 56 workmen\nwas  justified\t and   whether\t they\twere   entitled\t  to\nreinstatement with  continuity of service and full wages. It\nwas contended  by the company that the said workemn were not\nits employees,\tand in\tthe alternative,  the termination of\nthe services  of the workmen being the result of the closure\nof the\tghat in\t question, they\t were not  entitled  to\t any\nrelief.\t The   Industrial  Tribunal  had  made\tinconsistent\nfindings. It  had held\tthat the  relationship of master and\nservant had  been proved between the company and the workmen\nin question but had also added that no direct employment was\nintroduced, as\twas agreed to in the tripartite meeting held\non 10th\t November, 1959.  The Industrial  Tribunal had found\nthat the  workmen in  question were  the  employees  of\t the\ncompany and  had also  found that  the closure was bona fide\nand real and ech of the workmen was entitled to compensation\nunder sub-section  (1) of  <a href=\"/doc/1183163/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 25FFF</a>  of the  ID Act. On\nthese facts,  the  Court  held\tthat  the  company  had\t not\ndirectly employed  the workmen at all and it is the contract\nlabour which  used to  work for\t the company  at the ghat in\nquestion. The  Court further  found that  though the company\nhad guaranteed\tthe payment  at the prescribed rate to these\nworkmen and  in that  sense had\t undertaken the liability to\npay that  money at  that rate,\tthe record  showed that\t the\nmoney was  paid to the contractor and the contractor paid it\nto the\tworkmen from  month  to\t month\tuntil  the  ghat  in\nquestion was  closed. Even  one month&#x27;s\t basic pay which was\npaid to\t the workmen  for retrenching  them was paid to them\nthrough the  contractor. The Court, therefore, held that the\nTribunal was  in error\tin coming to the conclusion that the\nworkmen in  question had  been employed\t by the company. The\ncompany was  not the employer of the workmen in question and\nhence the  Tribunal could  give them  no relief. The workmen\nhad claim,  if any,  against the  contractor who  was  their\nemployer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"653552\" id=\"span_28\">In <a href=\"/doc/653552/\" id=\"a_171\">Krishna Kurup Vs.

The  Court also  observed that\t it was difficult to\ndecide for  the Court whether 82 workmen were doing the same\nwork as\t was being done by the 105 workmen who were absorbed\nby the\tcompany. The  Court also  relied upon  the affidavit\nfiled on  behalf of the company that it had not been able to\nprovide work  to all 105 workmen who were absorbed, and only\n22 of  them had\t been allotted\twork and the rest 83 had not\nbeen assigned  any work\t whatsoever. The  Court,  therefore,\nheld that it would not be justified in directing the company\nto absorb the 82 workmen and dismissed the appeal.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1934289\" id=\"span_29\">In <a href=\"/doc/1934289/\" id=\"a_172\">Gurmail\t Singh &amp;  Ors.

On these facts, the Court\nheld as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\t &quot;Section 25FF\tprovides that  where\n     there is a transfer of an undertaking by\n     agreement\tor   operation\tof   law,  an\n     employee who  loses his  job because  of\n     such  transfer  will  have\t a  right  to\n     compensation   from   the\t predecessor,\n     except where  he  gets  the  benefit  of\n     uninterrupted  service   with  the\t  new\n     employer on  no  less  favourable\tterms\n     than before  and  will  be\t entitled  to\n     compensation  in\tcase  he   should  be\n     retrenched later by the new employer. If\n     a\ttransfer  is  fictitious  or  benami,\n     Section 25-FF has no application at all.\n     In such  a\t case,\t&quot;there\thas  been  no\n     change of\townership or  management  and\n     despite  an   apparent   transfer,\t  the\n     transferor employer  continues to be the\n     real  employer   and  there  has  to  be\n     continuity of  service  under  the\t same\n     terms  and\t  conditions  of  service  as\n     before and\t there can  be no question of\n     compensation&quot;. A second type of cases is\n     one in  which  there  is  in  form,  and\n     perhaps also  in law,  a succession  but\n     the management  continues to  be in  the\n     hands  of\t the  same   set  of  persons\n     organised differently.  In\t such  cases,\n     the  transferee   and   transferor\t  are\n     virtually the  same and  the  overriding\n     principle should  be that\tno one should\n     be able  to  frustrate  the  intent  and\n     purpose  of   the\tlaw   by  drawing   a\n     corporate veil  across the\t eyes of  the\n     court. Though  these exceptions  to  the\n     above rules would still be operative, it\n     is not  necessary here to decide whether\n     this principle will help to identify the\n     transferee corporation  with  the\tState\n     Government\t for  the  present  purposes,\n     particularly as  there is\ta  catena  of\n     cases  which  do  not  approve  of\t such\n     identification.  A\t  third\t category  of\n     cases falling  as an  exception  to  the\n     principle behind Section 25-FF is where,\n     as\t  here,\t   the\t transferor    and/or\n     transferee\t is   a\t State\t or  a\tState\n     instrumentality, which  is\t required  to\n     act fairly\t and not  arbitrarily and the\n     court has\ta say as to whether the terms\n     and conditions  on which  it proposes to\n     hadn over\tor take\t over  an  industrial\n     undertaking  embody   the\trequisite  of\n     &quot;fairness\tin   action&quot;  and   could  be\n     upheld. In\t such circumstances,  it will\n     be open  to the  Court to review overall\n     aspects of\t transfer of  the undertaking\n     and the  arrangement between  the\tState\n     Government and  the Corporation  and  to\n     issue  appropriate\t directions  that  no\n     injustice results\tfrom the  changeover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">     Such directions  could be issued even if\n     the elements  of  the  transfer  in  the\n     present case  fall short  of a  complete\n     succession\t  to\tthe    business\t   or\n     undertaking  of   the   State   by\t  the\n     Corporation, as  the principle sought to\n     be applied is a constitutional principle\n     flowing from  the contours of Article 14\n     which  the\t State\tand  Corporation  are\n     obliged to adhere to.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">\t  x\t\tx\t       x\n\t  x\t\tx\t       x\n     Looking at the facts of this case in the\n     above perspective, it appears that the\n     State Government  has acted  arbitrarily\n     towards the  appellants. It has abridged\n     the  rights   of\tthe   appellants   by\n     purporting\t  to\ttransfer   only\t  the\n     tubewells and  retrenched the appellants\n     from  service   as\t a  consequence.  The\n     conduct of\t the government\t in depriving\n     the appellants  of substantial  benefits\n     which have\t accrued to  them as a result\n     of\t  their\t  long\t service   with\t  the\n     government,   although   the   tubewells\n     contine to\t be run\t at its\t cost by  the\n     Corporation  wholly   owned  by  it,  is\n     something which  is grossly  unfair  and\n     inequitable.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">     Holding thus,  the Court directed the absorption of the\nworkmen by  the Corporation, and granted them the benefit of\ntheir service  with the\t Government for\t the purposes of the\ncomputation  of\t  their\t salary,   length  of\tservice\t and\nretirement benefits,  but denied  them the  benefit to claim\nthe seniority over the employees of the Corporation engaged,\nsince its  commencement in  1970. The Court further directed\nthat the Corporation should ensure that the workmen were not\nretrenched as  surplus on  account of  any  closure  of\t any\ntubewells or  other like  reason until\tthey retired or left\nthe service of the Corporation voluntarily for any reason.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"777307\" id=\"span_30\">Thus, it  would be seen that these three decisions have\nnot in\tany way diluted the propositions of law <a href=\"/doc/1934289/\" id=\"a_175\">laid down by</a>\nthis Court  in <a href=\"/doc/777307/\" id=\"a_176\">Dimakuchi  and Standard Vacuum</a> (supra), where\nthe Court  has approved\t of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal\nto direct  the principal  employer to  absorb the workmen of\nthe erstwhile  contractor as  his direct employees depending\nupon the  satisfaction of  the factors laid down therein and\non terms  that the  Tribunal on\t the basis  of the  material\nbefore it,  may deem  fit to fix in the circumstances of the\ncase.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"180120\" id=\"span_31\">It is  also not  correct to  say  that  the  Act  is  a\ncomplete Code  by  itself  and,\t therefore,  the  industrial\nTribunal has  no jurisdiction  to give\ta direction  to\t the\nprincipal employer  to absorb  the workmen  in question.  We\nhave already  pointed out  that the  Act is  silent  on\t the\nquestion of  the status\t of the\t workmen  of  the  erstwhile\ncontractor once the contract is abolished by the appropriate\nGovernment. Hence,  as far  as the question of determination\nof the\tstatus of  the workmen is concerned, it remains open\nfor decision by the industrial adjudicator. There is nothing\nin the\tAct which  can be  construed to\t have  deprived\t the\nindustrial adjudicator\tof the jurisdiction to determine the\nsame. So  long as,  therefore, the said jurisdiction has not\nbeen taken  away from  the  industrial\tadjudicator  by\t any\nexpress provision  of the  Act or  of any  other statute, it\nwill have  to be  held that  the said jurisdiction which, as\npointed out above, has been recognised even by the decisions\nin Dimakuchi  and Standard Vacuum cases (supra) continues to\nexist.\tIn  the\t exercise  of  the  said  jurisdiction,\t the\nindustrial adjudicator can certainly make a contract between\nthe workmen  of the ex-contractor and the principal employer\nand direct the principal employer to absorb such of them and\non such\t terms as the adjudicator may determine in the facts\nof each\t case. We  find nothing in the decisions relied upon\non behalf  of the  appellant  which  goes  counter  to\tthis\nproposition  of\t  law.\tThe   decisions\t in  <a href=\"/doc/180120/\" id=\"a_177\">Indian  General\nNavigation and\tRailway\t Company  Ltd.,\t Krishna  Kurup\t and\nGurmail Singh</a>  (supra) on which reliance is placed on behalf\nof  the\t  appellant  for  the  purpose,\t have  already\tbeen\ndiscussed by us above.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"848120\" id=\"span_32\">The only additional decision which is\npressed into  service in  this\tbehalf\tis  <a href=\"/doc/848120/\" id=\"a_178\">Sanghi  Jeevaraj\nGhewar Chand  &amp; Ors.  Vs. Secretary, Madras Chillies, Grains\nKirana Merchants Worker</a>&#x27;s Union and Anr. [(1969) 1 SCR 366].\nBy a  common decision in this case, two appeals were decided\nby this\t Court. In  one appeal,\t the establishement employed\nless than  20 employees\t and it\t was not  a factory;  in the\nother appeal, the establishment was in the public sector. By\nreason of  exclusion under  <a href=\"/doc/217904/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 1(3)</a>  of the  Payment of\nBonus Act,  1965, the  establishment in the first appeal was\nexcluded from  the application of that Act whereas by reason\nof exemption  under <a href=\"/doc/592257/\" id=\"a_180\">Section  32(x)</a>, the establishment in the\nother appeal  stood exempted  from the operation of the said\nAct. On\t these facts, the question was whether the employees\nof the\ttwo establishments  could claim\t bonus de  hors\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/720619/\" id=\"a_181\">Payment of  Bonus Act</a>  and the\tCourt held,  considering the\nhistory\t of   the  legislation,\t  the  background   and\t the\ncircumstances in  which the  <a href=\"/doc/720619/\" id=\"a_182\">Bonus Act</a>\twas enacted, and the\nobject of  the Act  and its  scheme, that  the\tAct  was  an\nexhaustive Act,\t dealing comprehensively  with\tthe  subject\nmatter of  bonus in  all its aspects, and the Parliament had\nnot left  it open to those to whom the Act did not apply, by\nreason\tof   its  provisions   either  as  to  exclusion  or\nexemption, to  raise a\tdispute with regard to bonus through\nindustrial  adjudication   under  the\t<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_183\">ID  Act</a>\t  or   other\ncorresponding law.  <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_184\">The ID  Act</a> itself did not provide for a\nstatutory  right  for  payment\tof  bonus  although  it\t had\nprovided substantial  rights for  workmen with regard to lay\noff, retrenchment  compensation etc.  It will  thus be clear\nthat the  right to bonus which was spelt out by the judicial\ndecisions was  expressly denied\t by the\t <a href=\"/doc/720619/\" id=\"a_185\">Bonus\tAct</a>  to\t the\nworkmen in the establishment concerned <a href=\"/doc/848120/\" id=\"a_186\">in that case</a>, and yet\nthe workmen  claimed the  bonus on  the basis of the alleged\nprovisions of  the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_187\">ID  Act</a>. In\tthe present  case, there  is\nnothing in the Act, as pointed out earlier, which has either\nexpressly  or\timpliedly  taken  away\tthe  raising  of  an\nindustrial dispute  to absorb the ex-contractor&#x27;s workmen in\nthe  principal\testablishment  when  the  dispute  has\tbeen\nespoused by  the direct\t workmen or  the jurisdiction of the\nTribunal to  give a direction for the purpose, of course, on\nsuch terms  as it  deems fit  in the  circumstances of\teach\ncase.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">     For all  these reasons,  we are  unable to\t accept\t the\ncontention that the industrial adjudicator cannot direct the\nprincipal employer  to\tengage\tex-contractors&#x27;\t workmen  as\ndirect employees.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">23.  It was  then contended  that the  bulk of\tthe contract\nlabour was  engaged by\tthe contractors\t in the\t process  of\nunloading coal,\t and since  the year  1989  the\t process  of\nunloading coal had been fully mechanised at the Ukai Thermal\nPower Plant  with which\t we are\t concerned and\tas such,  no\nlabour was required in the process of the unloading of coal.\nFor this purpose, reliance was placed on the contents of the\nadditional affidavit  filed by\tthe Board during the hearing\nof the\tpresent appeal.\t We are\t concerned  in\tthe  present\nappeal with  the award\tof the Tribunal dated 22nd February,\n1988. If  a situation  has,  thereafter,  arisen  where\t the\nworkmen directed  to be\t employed by  the award\t have become\nsurplus, it is open for the appellant-Board to retrench them\nin accordance  with the\t provisions  of\t law.  However,\t the\nsituation in 1989 cannot be pressed into service to negative\nthe award  of 1988  by which  the dispute raised in 1982 was\nadjudicated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">24.  The last  argument was  that  the\tappellant-Board\t has\nseveral other  thermal\tpower  plants  in  the\tState  where\ncertain type of work is done through contract labour only by\ncontractors and\t the present Thermal Power plant is only one\nof them.  Any decision\tin the\tpresent\t appeal\t will  have,\ntherefore, according  to the  Board serious repercussions in\nthe other  plants. It  is contended  that  this\t might\talso\nresult in  total break-down  of the functioning of the Board\nwhich would  not be  in the  interest of  the workers  as  a\nclass. To say the least, the argument is one in terrorem and\nhas only  to be\t stated to  be rejected.  The Board  has  to\nmanage its  affairs according  to the provisions of law. The\nCourts cannot  grant it exemption from the law on the ground\nthat it will not be in a position to run its affairs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">     For the  above reasons,  we confirm the decision of the\nHigh Court  and the  award of  the Tribunal  and dismiss the\nappeal with costs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">C.A. 5498-02  &amp; 5503/95\t @ SLP (C) No. 9310-9314 and 9315 of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">1991</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"268805\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1416283\" id=\"span_35\">25.

While  parting  with  these  matters,  we\tcannot\thelp\nexpressing  our\t  dismay  over\t the  fact   that  even\t the\nundertakings in\t the public  sector have  been indulging  in\nunfair labour  practice by  engaging  contract\tlabour\twhen\nworkmen can  be employed diretly even according to the tests\n<a href=\"/doc/499423/\" id=\"a_192\">laid down by</a> <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 10</a> [2] of the Act. The only ostentsible\npurpose in  engaging the  contract  labour  instead  of\t the\ndirect employees  is the  monetary advantage by reducing the\nexpenditure. Apart from the fact that it is an unfair labour\npractice, it  is  also\tan  economically  short-sighted\t and\nunsound\t policy,   both\t from  the  point  of  view  of\t the\nundertaking concerned  and  the\t country  as  a\t whole.\t The\neconomic growth\t is not\t to be\tmeasured only  in  terms  of\nproduction and\tprofits. It  has to  be gauged\tprimarily in\nterms of  employment and  earnings of the people. Man has to\nbe the\tfocal point  of development.
