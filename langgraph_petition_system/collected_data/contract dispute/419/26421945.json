The requirement of details/particulars in support \n     of the same is a must.   Mere allegations of coercion and/or undue \n\n\n\n\n\n     influence   in   a   commercial   contract  like  this,  is  unacceptable.

I and II as referred \n                       \n     and discussed in Point Nos. VI.   It is not the question of the work \n     being   carried   out   by   BTP/SBP,   but   it   is   a   question   of   commercial \n     settlement   and   agreement   between   the   parties.     Under   what \n      \n\n\n     circumstances and why they entered into such type of commercial \n   \n\n\n\n     agreement and settlement is not the job of third party or the Court or \n     the Arbitral Tribunal.  The further discussion on the issue including \n     the   work   being   carried   out,   exclusively,   in   my   view,   looses   its \n\n\n\n\n\n     importance.   Once the settlement and its further action based upon \n     the same of the parties is accepted then there is no question of going \n     back to the original claim of 88.50% of the award amount in volume \n\n\n\n\n\n     Nos.

The, time to \n   \n\n\n\n     time, claims so raised are always need to be treated separate and \n     independent claims, so far as the Arbitral Tribunal is concerned.  In \n\n\n\n\n\n     view of the specific reference so made, though the contract terms \n     and conditions are same between the parties, I am not declined to \n     accept   the   submission   that   no   specific   reference   is   necessary   for \n\n\n\n\n\n     subsequent   claims.   Every   new   dispute   means   a   new   claim   and \n     therefore, a new reference,  unless party agreed and proceeded and \n     consented   to   adjudicate   all   the   claims   by   the   same   Arbitrator. \n     Admittedly,   there   is   no   such   consent   terms   and/or   permitted   the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:48:39 :::</span>\n      ssm                                 102                      Final DRAFT-April-jugment-891.10-\n     draft-15.4.2013\n\n\n     Arbitrator   to   proceed   with   the   subsequent   claims   in   the   same \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   \n     pending arbitration. \n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                          \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_313\">     133               There is no dispute with regard to the Arbitration clause \n     and specifically &quot;all disputes between the parties shall be referred to  \n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n     Arbitration&quot;.   I am inclined to observe that this arbitration clause is \n     wide enough to cover all disputes between the parties.  We have to \n     consider whether the learned Arbitrator is empowered to adjudicate \n\n\n\n\n                                          \n     particular claim so agitated and raised and referred by the parties. \n</p>                           \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_314\">     The   Arbitrator   is   bound   to   adjudicate   the   claim   as   referred   and \n     cannot go beyond the same.  The existence of Arbitration clause itself \n                          \n     is not sufficient to accept that the Arbitral Tribunal so constituted is \n     empowered to adjudicate all the disputes between the parties arising \n     out of the same contract,  though specifically not adjudicated and/or \n      \n\n\n     raised   as   per   the   procedure   so   prescribed   and/or   agreed   by   the \n   \n\n\n\n     parties.  Admittedly, for the claims arising out of these volumes IV to \n     VIII,   there   was   no   specific   reference   was   made,   as   there   was   no \n     specific dispute was requested to refer by invoking the Arbitration \n\n\n\n\n\n     clause in question.

The averments of \n     PEC so referred and read     as   recorded   above,   only   shows   that \n\n\n\n\n\n     such     entitlement   if   any  &quot;will   be     decided     in     such     Arbitration  \n     proceedings&quot;.

Suit No. 117 of 2008 filed by the Respondent was pending \n\n\n\n\n                                           \n     and so also the averments so raised and referred above.  Admittedly, \n                           \n     there   is   nothing   to   show   that   even   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Supreme   Court \n     directed   the   Arbitrator   to   deal   and/or   decide   all   the   disputes \n                          \n     between the parties. As noted, pursuance to the Arbitration clause, \n     the   challenge   was   raised   to   the   appointment   of   Arbitral   Tribunal \n     based   upon   those   five   claims   only.     The   Supreme   Court   has \n      \n\n\n     concluded   that   issue.     Subsequent   action   of   the   Respondent   of \n   \n\n\n\n     withdrawal of  the Suit based upon the averments so referred and \n     relied, is also cannot be treated and/or accepted that PEC, in view of \n     above averments, consented that all these subsequent claims should \n\n\n\n\n\n     also be referred before the same arbitral Tribunal.  On the contrary, \n     the   averments   clearly   shows   that   invocation   of   Arbitration \n     proceedings was necessary to claim any amount with respect to the \n\n\n\n\n\n     works executed by them and that would be adjudicated separately in \n     other Arbitration proceedings.  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_316\">     135               The   whole   purpose   and   scheme   of   the   Arbitration   is \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                            ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:48:39 :::</span>\n      ssm                                 104                      Final DRAFT-April-jugment-891.10-\n     draft-15.4.2013\n\n\n     based  upon   the   consent   of the  parties  to  get   their dispute  settled \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   \n     through   the   private   Arbitrator.     The   Arbitration   clause   provides \n     particular and specific procedure to be followed in case of dispute \n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n     between the parties.   This covers even the appointment /constitution \n     of   the   Arbitral   Tribunal.     It   was   never   agreed   that   one   party   can \n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n     appoint Arbitrator unilaterally.  It is not permissible also.  Therefore, \n     the   consent   for   appointment   of   Arbitral   Tribunal,   is   basic \n     requirement. Therefore, also in the present case, for want of consent, \n\n\n\n\n                                          \n     there was no question of adjudication of the claims by the learned \n                         \n     Arbitrator   beyond   what   was   already   referred.     As   noted   in   the \n     present   matter,   there   was   even   contest   with   regard   to   the \n                        \n     constitution of Arbitral Tribunal itself,   as there was no unanimity \n     with regard to the constitution of the Tribunal.   Thus, the conclusion \n     of the Supreme Court at the most can be treated final and binding \n      \n\n\n     with regard to the reference so made at the earlier point of time. \n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_317\">     Both  the   parties   have   no  choice   but  to   proceed   before   the   Single \n     Arbitrator, as directed.

Therefore, \n     requirement was in view of the agreed Arbitration clause to follow \n     the same for adjudication of the subsequent claims in question.

In the given case, the Court may or may not accept \n\n\n\n\n\n     preliminary objection so raised based upon <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 16</a>.   But, if the \n     case is made out then the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 34</a> has no option but \n     to deal with the aspect of jurisdiction/ objection as raised.   In the \n\n\n\n\n\n     present case, for the reasonings so recorded above on all the points, \n     as well as, the respective contentions so raised and as I am convinced \n     that the case is made out by PEC,   I am inclined to quash and set \n     aside the award.
