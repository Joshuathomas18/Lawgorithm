This appeal, under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent,\n\nhas been filed by the Gujarat Energy Transmission\n\nCorporation Limited (GETCO), on being aggrieved by the\n\noral order dated 28.06.2022 passed by the learned Single\n\nJudge dismissing the petition filed by the Corporation and\n\nin turn confirming the award dated 19.10.2016 passed by\n\nthe Labour Court, Anand in Reference (Demand) No. 1 of\n\n2012.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    Briefly stated, the facts in the petition indicate that\n\nthe petitioner - Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation\n\nLtd. had engaged workmen according to its perception on\n\nsecurity contracts.   These security workers engaged by\n\nthe appellant raised an industrial dispute inter alia\n\nstating that they were the direct employees of the\n\nCorporation and the contractor through which they had\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                           Page 2 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                  Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                      NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                                   CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                                      undefined\n\n\n\n\nbeen engaged was really a contract which was sham and\n\nbogus and therefore they should be treated as employees\n\nof the Corporation.          The Labour Court vide its award\n\ndated 19.10.2016 allowed the reference declaring that\n\nthe workmen of the respondent union were the workmen\n\nof the Corporation and the Corporation was therefore\n\ndirected to pay regular wages as if they were the\n\nemployees of the Corporation.                  Aggrieved by the award\n\nwhich held thus, the petition was filed. Facing dismissal,\n\nthe present appeal has been filed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Mr. Dipak Dave, learned counsel for the appellant\n\nwould submit that the employees - workmen engaged by\n\nthe contractor could not have been termed as the\n\nworkmen of the Corporation as they were not recruited\n\nthrough        a   regular    procedure          i.e.   issuance          of      an\n\nadvertisement and a competitive examination and/or\n\npersonal interview.          He would submit that the Tribunal\n\ncommitted an error when in fact one of its contractors\n\nShri Prajapati Chandrakant Manibhai was a Supervisor\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                Page 3 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                          Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                            NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                            undefined\n\n\n\n\nappointed by the contractor and for the Tribunal to hold\n\nthat he was a workman of the Corporation who was infact\n\nsupervising the work is illegal.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">3.1 Mr. Dave raising a preliminary contention with\n\nregard to the maintainability of the reference as also with\n\nregard to the existence of an industrial dispute, would\n\nsubmit that in the form the strength of the employees was\n\nshown as 50 whereas in fact the strength is 13,000. The\n\nunion was not a recognised union and therefore neither\n\nthere was an industrial dispute nor the union having its\n\nmembership could have a right to raise an industrial\n\ndispute.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">3.2 Mr. Dave, inviting the court&#x27;s attention to the terms\n\nof reference, would submit that reading the terms would\n\nindicate that the question that was framed by the Labour\n\nCourt was whether the workmen shown in the schedule\n\nwho are so called workmen of the contractor can be\n\ntreated as workmen of GETCO. The reference declared\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                          Page 4 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                          NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                       CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                          undefined\n\n\n\n\nthat the contract was sham and bogus.                  He would\n\ntherefore submit that the Labour Court went beyond the\n\nreference. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"483734\" id=\"span_7\">In support of his submissions, he would rely\n\non the decision in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/483734/\" id=\"a_1\">Pottery Mazdoor\n\nPanchayat v. Perfect Pottery Co. Ltd.</a> [(1979) 3 SCC\n\n762, paras-10, 15, 16)] and F T &amp; R Co of India (P)\n\nLtd. v. Its Workmen [(1981) 3 SCC 541, para-9].</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">3.3 Mr. Dave would further submit that the reasons\n\ngiven by the Labour court are totally perverse.                      He\n\nsubmitted that the Labour Court proceeded on the basis\n\nthat it was the responsibility of the employer to prove\n\nthat the contract is not sham and bogus. The approach of\n\nthe Labour Court was therefore entirely wrong.                     The\n\nreasons for drawing adverse inference on the ground that\n\nthe appellant had not been able to produce documentary\n\nevidence to show that the contract was not sham and\n\nbogus therefore was illegal. He would submit that except\n\nthe testimony of one witness Shri Hemraj Rabari, who\n\nwas examined by the respondent union, no documentary\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                        Page 5 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                              Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                            NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                            undefined\n\n\n\n\nevidence was produced by the union to show that there\n\nwas employer employee relationship; that the payment of\n\nwages was made by the employer; that there was\n\nsupervision and control over the employees by GETCO\n\nand that the employees were carried out core activities.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">3.4 Taking us through the 8th indicia that the Labour\n\nCourt had considered, Mr. Dave would submit that the\n\ncross examination of Shri Rabari clearly revealed that the\n\nemployees had signed the form for getting appointment\n\nwith the contractor M/s. Alert Allied Security Services.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">There was no evidence to substantiate the case that it\n\nwas the Deputy Executive Engineer who had been the\n\nappointing authority.   Reading the cross examination of\n\nthe Shri Rabari,   Mr. Dave would submit that even as per\n\nhis cross examination, when Chandrakantbhai was the\n\nsupervisor and he was allotting work to the employees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">The witness had also admitted that the bonus was being\n\npaid by the contractor. Mr. Dave further submitted that\n\nthe P.F slip clearly showed that the employer in fact was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                          Page 6 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                             NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                          CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                             undefined\n\n\n\n\nthe contractor.      This evidence was overlooked by the\n\nLabour Court and therefore in his submission the award\n\nmust be set aside.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">3.5 Referring to the testimony of witness of GETCO one\n\nShri Bhupendra Gandabhai Patle, Mr. Dave would submit\n\nthat it had clearly come out from the evidence of the\n\nwitness that the contract was engaged after floating a\n\ntender and there was therefore total misreading of the\n\nevidence. He would submit that the following documents\n\nnamely the settlement executed by the contractor with\n\nthe employees with regard to the dispute of P.F., the P.F.\n\nslip, the identity card, the register which had the\n\nsignatures were not considered by the Labour Court\n\nwhich were clearly indicative of the fact that in fact there\n\nwas a genuine contract.          He would submit that the\n\nfindings of the Labour Court are clearly perverse on the\n\nground that no documents have been produced by the\n\nworkmen to show that the contract is sham and bogus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">Shifting of the onus of proof on the employer was clearly\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                           Page 7 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                 Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                  NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                                  undefined\n\n\n\n\nmisconceived.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">3.6 Mr. Dave would submit that the documents proved\n\nand produced by the employer clearly indicated that the\n\ntender was issued after a regular advertisement. Ex. 36,\n\naccording to Mr. Dave, is a letter written to the\n\nSupervisor drawing attention as to how the security of\n\nthe premises is to be taken care and this letter was\n\nclearly a pointer to the fact that the security service was\n\ncarried out through a contractor. He would submit that\n\nall the tests applied by the Labour Court were erroneous.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">It cannot be said that the core activity of the company\n\nwas providing security services. He would submit that at\n\nbest what could have been done is and what was\n\nconsidered by the Labour Court was for declaring the\n\ncontract to be contrary to Section 10 and prohibit\n\ncontract labour.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"128510036\" id=\"span_14\">3.7 Relying on the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/128510036/\" id=\"a_2\">Bharat Heavy\n\nElectricals        Ltd.   vs.   Mahendra        Prasad         Jakhmola</a>\n\n[(2019) 13 SCC 82], he would submit that the decision\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                Page 8 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                      Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                            NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\n C/LPA/1549/2022                         CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                            undefined\n\n\n\n\nwould indicate that the findings of the Labour Court that\n\nthe contract is sham and bogus are perverse.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184584358\" id=\"span_17\">Relying on\n\nthe decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/184584358/\" id=\"a_3\">Balwant Rai Saluja vs. Air\n\nIndia Limited</a> [(2014) 9 SCC 407 paras 35, 36, 50-\n\n61], he would submit that it was very clearly held in the\n\ncase that there were two prominent tests (1) the payment\n\nof wages by the contractor and (2) supervision and\n\ncontrol by the contractor which would make the case of\n\nthe employee vulnerable.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1160961\" id=\"span_18\">Relying on the decision in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1160961/\" id=\"a_4\">Steel Authority of India vs. Union of India</a>\n\n[(2006) 12 SCC 233] and relying on paragraphs no. 13,\n\n14,18 and 22-28 thereof, he would submit that it was an\n\nadmitted fact that there was no employer employee\n\nrelationship and that it was clearly erroneous to hold that\n\nthe contract was sham and bogus.

In the background of this\n\nwhen the documentary evidence is considered, the\n\nLabour Court found that the appellant had not produced\n\nany document to suggest that the security workers were\n\nappointed through contractors or that the contract\n\nsystem was in force.

The Labour Court\n\ntherefore found inconsistencies in the versions of the\n\nappellant and that of the contractor. If the contract was\n\ngenuine and when the testimony of Shri Bhupendra Patle\n\nis perused, the case of the Corporation was that the\n\ncontractors were appointed through a regular tender\n\nprocess. No documents were produced before the Labour\n\nCourt nor were the contracts produced to indicate that a\n\ncontract was entered into through a process of tendering\n\nand therefore the plea of the workmen that the contract\n\nwas sham and bogus was accepted.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">7.

Once it is shown that a\n              body of workmen either acting through their union or\n              otherwise had sponsored the workmen&#x27;s case, it\n              becomes an industrial dispute.

The inference drawn\n                  from Ex.M1 that it was the Union, who wanted\n                  the canteen is far from truth. The subsequent\n                  evidence has got to be looked into on this aspect\n                  of the case. In Ex.M4, dated 23.4.1988, the Union\n                  has informed the bank about the new canteen\n                  promoters for the record of the bank. The\n                  inference drawn by the learned Judge from Ex.M5\n                  that the canteen was not exclusive for the bank is\n                  based on a misconception. The evidence of MW1\n                  clearly shows that the canteen is meant only for\n                  the bank.

Yet in another decision of the\n              Apex Court in case of Workmen of Rohtak General\n              Transport Company vs. Rohtak General Transport\n              Company passed in Civil Appeal No.349 of 1961 dated\n              27.02.1962 explaining an industrial dispute what is\n              dispute between some workmen and their employer.\n              While examining the facts, the Court held that, if the\n              respondent has raised an issue that even a minority\n              workmen has not espoused the cause, it would have\n              been open for the appellants therein to lead the\n              evidence to show that the union which served the\n              demand notice was entitled to act on behalf of the\n              workmen and as in the facts of that case, that cause\n              was not adopted, as the issue before the Labour Court\n              was different, and therefore, the cause of the two\n              workmen not being espoused by the majority of the\n              workmen was not held to be a ground to refuse the\n              reference. Similarly, when the issue was not before the\n              Labour Court, there was no scope for either side to\n              establish this fact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">              14.

The witness of Bardhan &amp; Co. has, in terms,\n              admitted that the workers concerned were working in\n              the stockyard before the contract was entered into by\n              SAIL with Bardhan &amp; Co., and Bardhan &amp; Co. was not\n              concerned with the workmen after the period of\n              contract was over. The evidence on record does not\n              establish that the workmen concerned were recruited\n              by the labour contractors and, thereafter, their services\n              were made available to the writ petitioner. The writ\n              petitioner claims that the workmen are not its\n              employees whereas Bardhan &amp; Co. has claimed that it\n              has no concern whatsoever with the workmen.\n              Naturally, therefore, a question would arise as to who\n              is the employer of the workmen. It is nobody&#x27;s case that\n              the workmen are self-employed workmen. The writ\n              petitioner could not lead any evidence to show that at\n              the time when the reference was made, an independent\n              handling contractor was appointed who had recruited\n              the workmen. During the pendency of reference, the\n              contract with Bardhan &amp; Co. had come to an end by\n              efflux of time. No evidence could be led by the writ\n              petitioner that after exit of Bardhan &amp; Co. from the\n              scene, another handling contractor was appointed, who\n              had recruited the workmen concerned. Thus, in\n              absence of relevant evidence, the workmen concerned\n              will have to be regarded as employees of the writ\n              petitioner. The claim that the workers have been\n              continued in the stockyard pursuant to directions given\n              by the High Court in the two petitions filed by the\n              workmen, has no substance because the petitions were\n              filed in the year 1990 for protection of service\n              conditions of labourers, but the labourers have been\n              continued in the stockyard at least since 1977.

So far as the question whether the workers do\n              labour to produce goods or service for the principal\n              employer is concerned, this Court finds that all the\n              major activities of the principal employer carried out at\n              the stockyard are done through the workmen employed.\n              The work of loading and unloading is essential and\n              integral part of business of writ petitioner and without\n              this work, the writ petitioner cannot sell its products.\n              The evidence on record would show that if the\n              labourers stop doing work in the stockyard, the activity\n              in the stockyard would come to a grinding halt. The\n              workers unload, sort out, shift, stack, reload the\n              materials received, for and on behalf of the principal\n              employer and not for the labour contractor. Under the\n              circumstances, there is no manner of doubt that the\n              workmen concerned do the labour work to produce\n              goods or service for business of the principal employer.\n              So far as compliance of the provisions of the Act is\n              concerned, no evidence could be adduced by the writ\n              petitioner to establish that Bardhan &amp; Co. and before\n              that all other contractors had complied with the\n              provisions of the Act. This factor by itself may not be\n              determinative, but is a relevant circumstance, which\n              can be considered along with other factors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">              29. If a cumulative effect of abovereferred to factors is\n              taken into consideration, it becomes at once evident\n              that the presence of intermediate contractor with\n              whom alone the workers have immediate or direct\n              relationship, ex-contractu, is of no consequence when\n              on lifting or piercing veil, one discovers that so-called\n              contract of handling entered into with the contractor is\n              a ruse, a facade and a name lender and that the real\n              employer of the workmen is the writ petitioner and not\n              the immediate contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">                    Though instant case will have to be decided with\n              reference to the facts and circumstances as emerging\n              from the evidence led by parties, reference to some of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                Page 40 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                       Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                   NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\nC/LPA/1549/2022                                 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                                   undefined\n\n\n\n\n              the judgments relevant on the point would not be out of\n              place. In Hussainbhai, Calicut (supra), a number of\n              workers were engaged to make ropes within factory,\n              but those workmen, according to the petitioner, were\n              hired by contractors, who had executed agreements\n              with the petitioner to get such work done. Therefore, it\n              was contended that the workmen were not workmen of\n              the petitioner, but the contractors&#x27; workmen. The\n              Supreme Court indicated true test with brevity and\n              stated that where a worker or group of workers labours\n              to produce goods or services and these goods or service\n              are for the business of another, that other is, in fact,\n              the employer. What is laid down by the Supreme Court\n              is that the person on whose behalf a worker or a group\n              of workers labours to produce goods or services has\n              economic control over the workers&#x27; subsistence, skill\n              and continued employment and the presence of\n              intermediate contractors with whom alone the workers\n              have immediate or direct relationship, ex-Contractu, is\n              of no consequence when on lifting veil or looking at the\n              conspectus of factors governing employment, one\n              discerns the naked truth, though draped in different\n              perfect paper arrangement, that the real employer is\n              the Management, and not the immediate contractor.\n              What is emphasised by the Supreme Court is that\n              Myriad devices, half-hidden in fold after fold of legal\n              form depending on the degree of concealment needed,\n              the type of industries, the local conditions and the like\n              may be resorted to after ascertaining the true\n              relationship between the parties. Applying these\n              principles to the facts of the present case, this Court\n              finds that the award of the Tribunal impugned in the\n              petition is perfectly inconsonance with the principles\n              enunciated by the Supreme Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"938485\" id=\"span_97\">Further, in <a href=\"/doc/938485/\" id=\"a_52\">Union of India and Others v.

The question about the limits of the\n                    jurisdiction of High Courts in issuing a writ of\n                    certiorari under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_64\">Art. 226</a> has been frequently\n                    considered by this Court and the true legal\n                    position in that behalf is no longer in doubt. A\n                    writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting\n                    errors of jurisdiction committed by inferior courts\n                    or tribunals : these are cases where orders are\n                    passed by inferior courts or tribunals without\n                    jurisdiction, or is in excess of it, or as a result of\n                    failure to exercise jurisdiction. A writ can\n                    similarly be issued where in exercise of\n                    jurisdiction conferred on it, the Court or Tribunal\n                    acts illegally or improperly, as for instance, it\n                    decides a question without giving an opportunity\n                    to be heard to the party affected by the order, or\n                    where the procedure adopted in dealing with the\n                    dispute is opposed to principles of natural justice.\n                    There is, however, no doubt that the jurisdiction\n                    to issue a writ of certiorari is a supervisory\n                    jurisdiction and the Court exercising it is not\n                    entitled to act as an appellate Court. This\n                    limitation necessarily means that findings of fact\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                Page 45 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                       Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                  NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\nC/LPA/1549/2022                                CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                                  undefined\n\n\n\n\n                   reached by the inferior Court or Tribunal as\n                   result of the appreciation of evidence cannot be\n                   reopened or questioned in writ proceedings.

On failure of conciliation\n              proceedings, dispute, namely, whether termination of\n              services of Shri Sadhu Ram was illegal and unjustified\n              and if so, what directions were necessary, was referred\n              to the Labour Court. On behalf of management, a\n              contention was raised that the workman had not raised\n              any demand with the management and, therefore, there\n              was no industrial dispute.

The High\n              Court had gone into a learned discussion on what was\n              an industrial dispute, but the Supreme Court was of the\n              opinion that it was an entirely unnecessary exercise.\n              The High Court had forgotten the basic fact that the\n              Labour Court had given findings on facts and quashed\n              the award.

We are afraid the High Court misdirected\n                   itself. The jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_72\">Art. 226</a> of the\n                   Constitution is truly wide but, for that very reason\n                   it has to be exercised with great circumspection.\n                   It is not for the High Court to constitute itself into\n                   an appellate Court over Tribunals constituted\n                   under special legislations to resolve disputes of a\n                   kind qualitatively different from ordinary civil\n                   disputes and to readjudicate upon questions of\n                   fact decided by those Tribunals.

The relevant observations made by the Supreme\n              Court in the above quoted two decisions make it\n              evident that a limited jurisdiction is available to High\n              Courts while considering the question, whether a writ\n              of certiorari, as claimed by the writ petitioner, can be\n              issued. Under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_73\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, High\n              Court will not interfere with weighing of evidence led\n              before the Tribunal as if the High Court were sitting in\n              appeal. A finding of fact cannot also be challenged on\n              the ground that relevant materials and evidence\n              adduced before the Tribunal was insufficient or\n              inadequate to sustain the findings recorded by the\n              Tribunal. The adequacy or sufficiency of evidence and\n              the inferences to be drawn from the evidence are the\n              exclusive domain of the Tribunal and the same cannot\n              be agitated before the writ Court. This is so because\n              the Tribunal is constituted under Special Legislation to\n              resolve the dispute of a kind qualitatively different from\n              ordinary civil disputes. This is also so because the\n              Tribunals are not bound by strict Rules of evidence.\n              Merely because more than one view is possible on the\n              evidence led before the Tribunal, the writ Court would\n              not be justified to interfere with the findings recorded\n              by the Tribunal. Of course, if the findings recorded by\n              the Tribunal are perverse or irrational or arrived at by\n              ignoring materials on record or arbitrary or contrary to\n              the principles of natural justice, the same can be\n              interfered with by the High Court in a petition under\n              <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution wherein certiorari is\n              claimed. However, in instant case, this Court finds that\n              all oral and documentary evidence adduced by the\n              parties is considered by the Tribunal and findings of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                Page 48 of 52</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                       Downloaded on : Wed Apr 24 20:40:28 IST 2024</span>\n                                                                                   NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\nC/LPA/1549/2022                                 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 22/04/2024\n\n                                                                                   undefined\n\n\n\n\n              facts have been rendered. The finding of the Tribunal\n              on the genuineness of the contract between SAIL and\n              Bardhan &amp; Co. is only one aspect of the controversy,\n              whether workmen were ever employees of the\n              contractors or were always employed by SAIL. The\n              Tribunal has not reached the conclusion regarding\n              direct employment by SAIL of these workmen only on\n              the basis of finding relating to the document in\n              question, but has taken into consideration cumulative\n              effect of facts proved. It would be uncharitable to\n              criticise the Tribunal on this score. It is true that\n              burden of proof to prove the fact rests upon a person\n              who asserts existence of the same, and there is no\n              manner of doubt that primary burden of proof to prove\n              that the workmen concerned were employees of SAIL,\n              was on the workmen. However, both by way of their\n              claim statement and oral evidence, the workmen have\n              established that they were never recruited by any of the\n              contractors and were under control and supervision of\n              SAIL. The Tribunal has considered the evidence led by\n              the writ petitioner, and reached a conclusion in\n              paragraph 13 of the impugned award that the\n              concerned workmen were/are serving under the\n              supervision, control and direction of SAIL. The best\n              evidence that could have been produced, viz.\n              employment record, could not be produced by the writ\n              petitioner before the Tribunal. Further, when the\n              evidence of witness of Bardhan &amp; Co. was recorded\n              before the Tribunal, the term of contract with Bardhan\n              &amp; Co. was over. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366776\" id=\"span_121\">No evidence was led by the writ\n              petitioner before the Tribunal to show that new\n              handling contractor was appointed to handle the\n              materials received at the stockyard and that the\n              contractor had recruited the workmen concerned.\n              Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the burden of proof\n              has not been discharged by the workmen concerned.\n              Moreover, it is well settled that once the parties have\n              led evidence understanding the nature of the case to be\n              met, and the Court has recorded the findings on the\n              basis of evidence led, the question of burden of proof\n              becomes academic.

The learned Senior Advocates appearing for\n              the respondents have rightly contended that this is a\n              petition which is essentially filed under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 227</a> of\n              the Constitution, wherein legality of the award of the\n              Tribunal declaring that the workmen employed in the\n              stockyard located at Kaligam, Ahmedabad, are\n              workmen of SAIL, is under challenge. It is now well\n              established that the award of the Tribunal can be\n              challenged by an aggrieved party, both under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_78\">Article\n              226</a> or 227 of the Constitution or under both the\n              Articles. However, choice is with the aggrieved party.\n              Whether aggrieved party has chosen to approach the\n              High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 226</a> or 227 has to be\n              ascertained not only from the pleadings, but also from\n              the fact, whether the Tribunal whose award is\n              challenged is impleaded as one of the necessary parties\n              in the petition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1613762\" id=\"span_124\">In <a href=\"/doc/1613762/\" id=\"a_80\">Udit Narain Singh Malpaharia</a> (supra)\n              the Supreme Court has ruled that the Tribunal is not a\n              necessary party where the petition is filed under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_81\">Article\n              227</a> of the Constitution, but the Tribunal is a necessary\n              party if the petition is filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 226</a> of the\n              Constitution and appropriate reliefs are claimed.

Further, what is claimed is writ of\n               certiorari and the writ of certiorari means calling of\n               record of subordinate authority and rendering decision\n               by the High Court after considering the materials\n               placed before the authority. The documents which are\n               sought to be relied upon by the writ petitioner in the\n               petition does not form part of record of the Tribunal.\n               Under the circumstances, writ of certiorari cannot be\n               issued on the basis of document sought to be produced\n               and relied upon by the writ petitioner. Moreover, the\n               Tribunal had no opportunity to deal with the documents\n               which are sought to be produced and relied upon by the\n               writ petitioner. These documents never formed part of\n               record of the Tribunal at any stage. Though the\n               documents sought to be relied upon are prior in point of\n               time to the date of reference, none of them was\n               produced by the writ petitioner before the Tribunal.\n               The High Court would not be justified in setting aside\n               the award of the Tribunal on the basis of new\n               documents sought to be produced for the first time in\n               the writ petition. This would be simply unfair to the\n               Tribunal, and does not advance the cause of justice.\n               Therefore, no relief can be granted to the writ\n               petitioner on the basis of new documents sought to be\n               produced and relied upon for the first time in instant\n               petition.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">10.
