This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_50\">Kishorilal Gupta</a>&#x27;s case (supra)\n      examined the question whether an arbitration clause\n      can be invoked in the case of a dispute under a\n      superseded contract. The principle laid down is that if\n      the contract is superseded by another, the arbitration\n      clause, being a component part of the earlier contract,\n      falls with it. But where the dispute is whether such\n      contract is void ab intio, the arbitration clause cannot\n      operate on those disputes, for its operative force\n      depends upon the existence of the contract and its\n      validity. The various other observations were made by\n      this Court in the above-mentioned judgment in respect\n      of &quot;settlement of disputes arising under the original\n                                         Miscellaneous Appeal No.2284/2020\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                -12-</span>\n\n\n      contract, including the dispute as to the breach of the\n      contract and its consequences&quot;.</span> Principle <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_51\">laid down by</a>\n      the House of Lords in Heyman v. Darwins Limited\n      1942 (1) All. E.R. -337 was also relied on by this\n      Court for its conclusion. The Collective bargaining\n      principle laid down by the US Supreme Court in Nolde\n      Bros. case (supra) would not apply to the facts of the\n      present case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      8.     We may indicate that so far as the present case\n      is concerned, parties have entered into a fresh contract\n      contained in the Exit paper which does not even\n      indicate any disputes arising under the original\n      contract or about the settlement thereof, it is nothing\n      but a pure and simple novation of the original contract\n      by mutual consent. Above being the factual and legal\n      position, we find no error in the view taken by the\n      High Court. The appeal, therefore, lacks merit and\n      stands dismissed, with no order as to costs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      In the considered opinion of this Court, in the\naforesaid case also, the contract was superseded by another\ncontract, whereas in the present case, there is only one\nagreement out of which dispute has arisen between the\nparties, and therefore, the question of interference by this\nCourt in respect of jurisdictional issue does not arise..\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">23.   Learned senior counsel for the appellant has\nvehemently argued before this Court that the arbitration\nclause or exclusive jurisdiction clauses cannot be foisted or\nforced upon those parties, who have not signed or agreed to\nsuch clauses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">24.   In the present case, the present appellant, for the\nreasons best known to the appellant, did not implead the\nrespondent No.3 while filing the civil suit, though the\nrespondent No.3 was beneficiary of the bank guarantee. A\nmischief was played by filing a civil suit only against the\nbank and in obtaining an injunction order. It was only after\nintervention of this Court, the respondent No.3 was\nimpleaded by the appellant as defendant in the year 2020.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">                                          Miscellaneous Appeal No.2284/2020\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 -13-</span>\n\n\n\nThe respondent No.3 is certainly a necessary party, and\ntherefore, as the appellant and respondent No.3 have signed\nthe agreement out of which the dispute is arising and there\nis an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the judgments relied\nupon by the appellant is of no help to the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"72238050\" id=\"span_42\">25.   The bank guarantee agreement is an independent\ncontract and there is no doubt about it. The same has been\nheld in the case of <a href=\"/doc/72238050/\" id=\"a_52\">Standard Chartered Bank</a> (supra),\nhowever, in the present case, the issue relates to jurisdiction\nin respect of a dispute arising out of an agreement entered\ninto by the parties, which contains territorial jurisdiction\nclause categorically specifying that in case of any legal\nmatter, the territorial jurisdiction of the Court would be at\nNagpur (Maharashtra), and therefore, the judgment relied\nupon by learned counsel does not help the appellant in any\nmanner.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">26.   In the case of Branch Manager, Magma Leasing and\nFinance Limited &amp; Others (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in paragraph - 15 has held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      &quot;15. In the instant case, clause 22 of the hire\n      purchase agreement that provides for arbitration has\n      been couched in widest possible terms as can well be\n      imagined. It embraces all disputes, differences, claims\n      and questions between the parties arising out of the\n      said agreement or in any way relating thereto. The hire\n      purchase agreement having been admittedly entered\n      into between the parties and the disputes and\n      differences have since arisen between them, we hold,\n      as it must be, that the arbitration clause 22 survives for\n      the purpose of their resolution although the contract\n      has come to an end on account of its termination.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">      In the aforesaid case, there was a contractual dispute\nresolution clause and the contract was terminated. The\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that arbitration clause\nneither perishes nor become inoperative in such a case. It\n                                          Miscellaneous Appeal No.2284/2020\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                -14-</span>\n\n\n\nsurvives for the purpose of resolution of dispute to the\nextent specified in the clause concerned. Keeping in view\nthe aforesaid judgment, even if it is proved that the contract\nhas been terminated, the jurisdiction clause and the\narbitration clause will not perish, and therefore, as the\njurisdiction is exclusively at Nagpur, this Court does not\nfind any reason to interfere with the order passed by the\nCommercial Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">27.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1549410\" id=\"span_44\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1549410/\" id=\"a_53\">South East Asia Shipping Company\nLimited</a> (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in paragraphs -\n3 and 4 has held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      &quot;3.     It is settle law that cause of action consists of\n      bundle of facts which give cause to enforce the legal\n      injury for redress in a court of law. The cause of action\n      means, therefore, every fact, which if transferred, it\n      would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order\n      to support his right to a judgment of the Court. In other\n      words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law\n      applicable to them, gives the plaintiff a right to claim\n      relief against the defendant. It must include some act\n      done by the defendant since in the absence of such an\n      act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would\n      arise. In view of the admitted position that contract\n      was executed in Bombay, i.e., within the jurisdiction\n      of the High Court of Bombay, performance of the\n      contract was also to be done within the jurisdiction of\n      the Bombay High Court; merely because bank\n      guarantee has executed at Delhi and transmitted for\n      performance in Bombay, it does not constitute a cause\n      of action to give rise to the respondent to lay the suit\n      on the original side of the Delhi High Court. The\n      contention that the Division Bench was right in its\n      finding and that since the bank guarantee was executed\n      and liability was enforced from the bank at Delhi, the\n      Court got jurisdiction, cannot be sustained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      4.      We, therefore, hold that the learned single\n      Judge was right in his conclusion that no part of the\n      cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction on the\n      original side of the High Court of Delhi and direct to\n      return the plaint for presentation to the proper court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">      In the aforesaid case also, a contract was executed at\nBombay, performance of contract was required to be\n                                          Miscellaneous Appeal No.2284/2020\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                 -15-</span>\n\n\n\ntransmitted to Bombay, suit was filed before Delhi High\nCourt for perpetual injunction against the appellant therein\nfor   enforcing     the   bank      guarantee       and     in    those\ncircumstances, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that\nmere execution of bank guarantee at Delhi would not give\nrise to cause of action at Delhi.

Learned counsel for the appellant has also\n      submitted that City Civil Court, Hyderabad had no\n      jurisdiction to entertain the application moved by the\n      respondent as no part of cause of action had accrued\n      there. In this connection, he has referred to clause (b)\n      of sub-section (12) of <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 11</a> and clause (e) of sub-\n      section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1455010/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 2</a> of the Act which will govern\n      the question of jurisdiction as to Chief Justice of which\n      High Court has to be approached for moving an\n      application under <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 11</a> of the Act. Learned\n      counsel has submitted that the tenders were floated at\n      Kolkata, the respondent submitted the tender at\n      Kolkata, the agreement was executed at Kolkata and,\n      therefore, the court at Hyderabad had no jurisdiction to\n      entertain the application. Learned counsel has also\n      submitted that the view taken by the High Court that as\n      the bank guarantee was furnished at Hyderabad and\n      was encashed at Hyderabad, the court at Hyderabad\n      has jurisdiction is erroneous in law inasmuch as the\n                                          Miscellaneous Appeal No.2284/2020\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                -16-</span>\n\n\n      agreement did not contain any clause regarding the\n      place from where the bank guarantee had to be\n      furnished. Learned counsel has submitted that there\n      was only a requirement for furnishing the bank\n      guarantee and that it could be furnished from\n      anywhere in India and since in the present case the\n      bank guarantee was furnished by the respondent from\n      a bank at Hyderabad it was encashed there and,\n      therefore, the said fact was wholly irrelevant for\n      deciding the plea of jurisdiction. He has also relied\n      upon a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1549410/\" id=\"a_58\">South East Asia\n      Shipping Co. Ltd. vs. Nav Bharat Enterprises Pvt. Ltd</a> .\n      (1996) 3 SCC 443, in support of his contention that the\n      submission of the bank guarantee from Hyderabad or\n      the encashment thereof does not constitute even a part\n      of cause of action to confer jurisdiction on the court at\n      Hyderabad. Though we find substance in the\n      contention raised by the learned counsel for the\n      appellant but in view of our finding recorded on the\n      main point, we do not consider it necessary to express\n      any final opinion on the second contention.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">      In the aforesaid case also, the bank guarantee was\nfurnished at Hyderabad and was encashed at Hyderabad,\neven though the Court has held that submission of the bank\nguarantee from Hyderabad or encashment thereof, does not\nconstitute even a part of cause of action to confer\njurisdiction on the Court of Hyderabad.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">30.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140286\" id=\"span_49\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/140286/\" id=\"a_59\">National Agriculture Coop Marketing\nFederation Limited</a> (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\nparagraph - 6 has held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      &quot;6.     The respondent contends that the contract was\n      abrogated by mutual agreement; and when the contract\n      came to an end, the arbitration agreement which forms\n      part of the contract, also came to an end. Such a\n      contention has never been accepted in law. An\n      arbitration clause is a collateral term in the contract,\n      which relates to resolution disputes, and not\n      performance. Even if the performance of the contract\n      comes to an end on account of repudiation, frustration\n      or breach of contract, the arbitration agreement would\n      survive for the purpose of resolution of disputes\n      arising under or in connection with the contract.\n      [Vide : Heymen vs. Darwins Ltd - 1942 (1) All ER\n      337, Union of India vs. Kishori Lal Gupta &amp; Bros . - AIR\n      1959 SC 1362 and The Naihati Jute Mills Ltd. vs.\n                                              Miscellaneous Appeal No.2284/2020\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                    -17-</span>\n\n\n          Khyaliram Jagannath - AIR 1968 SC 522]. This position\n          is now statutorily recognized. Sub-section (1) of\n          <a href=\"/doc/365890/\" id=\"a_60\">section 16</a> of the Act makes it clear that while\n          considering any objection with respect to the existence\n          or validity of the arbitration agreement, an arbitration\n          clause which forms part of the contract, has to be\n          treated as an agreement independent of the other terms\n          of the contract; and a decision that the contract is null\n          and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the\n          arbitration clause. The first contention is, therefore,\n          liable to be rejected.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">31.       In light of the aforesaid, the dispute between the\nparties is arising out of the initial agreement and even if the\ncontract comes to an end, as argued by learned senior\ncounsel for the appellant, the jurisdictional clause does not\nvanish, and therefore, the Commercial Court was justified\nin passing the impugned order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">32.
