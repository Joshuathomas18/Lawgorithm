Briefly stated, the Government of Rajasthan issued a Notice\n\nInviting Tender through the Public Health Engineering Department\n\non 15th February 2012 bearing number 07/11-12 for the Balotra\n\nPipeline Project SPR-2 Project, Santra Bhakra Head. The appellant-\n\ncompany was awarded the tender and the work order was issued\n\nin   its   favour    on     14th     September           2012.        Pursuant     thereto,\n\nAgreement No.07/12-13 was signed on 18th September 2012\n\nbetween the appellant-company and the Executive Engineer, Public\n\nHealth Engineering Department, Project Division at Balotra. Later\n\non, the contract value of Rs.187.01 crores was reduced to Rs.\n\n165.10 crores by mutual consent. This is pleaded by the\n\nappellant-company that it had completed work to the extent of\n\nRs.111.26 crores and it entered into a Sub-letting contract on 19 th\n\nApril 2017 with M/s S.N.S.S.

On 13th April 2018, a notice for termination was issued to the\n\nrespondent no.1 as per clause 22 of the Sub-letting contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.     About four years thereafter, a notice dated 05 th January 2022\n\nwas served upon the appellant-company by the respondent no.1\n\non 13th January 2022 intimating the appellant-company about pre-\n\ninstitution mediation on 18th January 2022. The pre-institution\n\nmediation, however, remained a non-starter and Civil Misc. Case\n\nNCV No.35/2022 titled &quot;M/S. S.N.C.C. Construction v. M/S.\n\nS.M.P.L Infra Ltd. &amp; Ors.&quot; came to be instituted by the respondent\n\nno.1    in    the   Court       at     Jodhpur         seeking      a    decree    for\n\nRs.6,83,69,682/-.

The applicant/defendant states that the Case No.35/22 is\n        not maintainable either in law or in facts.

The respondent plaintiff is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                        (Downloaded on 24/04/2025 at 09:15:58 PM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JD:17797-DB]                  (5 of 16)                       [CMA-3045/2024]\n\n\n       deliberately misleading the Learned Court. The entire suit is\n       misconceived and is an abuse of process. Any application, if any,\n       filed in connection thereto and/or in support thereof are also not\n       maintainable as the same suffer from the same vices as stated\n       above.   The     applicant/defendant        states     that   any   and   all\n       applications filed by the respondent/plaintiff in the commercial\n       suit are misleading and filed with malafide intentions for the\n       purposes of making illegal gains at the cost of the applicant\n       defendant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       14. The respondent/plaintiff, as it appears from a plain reading\n       of the plaint, while relying on the agreement has deliberately\n       suppressed the Arbitration clause as agreed upon by the parties\n       to the agreement dated April 19, 2017. The respondent/plaintiff\n       relies upon the agreement dated April 19, 2017 but at the same\n       time deliberately refuses to act in terms thereof.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       15. As stated earlier, the intention of the parties to the\n       agreement to adjudicate / settle any and all disputes arising out\n       of the agreement dated April 19,2017 by way of arbitration at\n       Delhi, is a subsisting agreement between parties standing on its\n       own independent legs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       16. In terms of the arbitration clause enshrined within the\n       agreement dated April 19, 2017, the Arbitration as agreed upon\n       by the parties shall be held in Delhi as per the provisions of the\n       <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_4\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>. In view of Clause 24 of the\n       said agreement, the respondent/plaintiff has deliberately tried to\n       harass the applicant/defendant by instituting the instant matter\n       before this Learned Court. The applicant states that in the event\n       this Learned Court entertains the instant suit, the Learned Court\n       shall be acquiring jurisdiction and interfering in a dispute which\n       has been agreed upon by the plaintiff to being settled by way of\n       Arbitration at Delhi.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       17. In view of the fact that the arbitration clause has not been\n       deleted and/or modified and/or rescinded and/or removed the\n       arbitration agreement remains to this date a valid subsisting\n       agreement between the parties standing on its own independent\n       legs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       18. It is not out of place to mention that the jurisdiction\n       conferred and agreed to by and between the parties is to be\n       construed harmoniously and cannot be read into as self-contrary\n       or self-destructive. The jurisdiction agreed upon is merely in aide\n       of the construction which furthers the scope of the alternate\n       dispute redress mechanism agreed upon by the parties in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                        (Downloaded on 24/04/2025 at 09:15:58 PM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JD:17797-DB]                     (6 of 16)                          [CMA-3045/2024]\n\n\n       event of disputes. In as much as the disputes which have arisen\n       between the parties can be decided upon by an arbitrator, this\n       Learned Court ought not otherwise acquire jurisdiction, interfere\n       and/or even try the matter on merits as yet.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       19. The underlying scope of the agreement from the very date\n       of its execution has been that of the plaintiff completing its\n       obligations     under     the    agreement        first    and   thereafter     the\n       defendant/applicant proceeding with its share of obligations.\n       Under the agreement the plaintiff has specified and particular\n       duties and obligations which the plaintiff for reasons best known\n       to itself did not fulfill. In fact the termination of the agreement\n       was on account of the plaintiff not complying its share of\n       obligations.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">       20. In any event the applicant herein has not submitted to the\n       jurisdiction of this Learned Court and is only bringing to the\n       knowledge of this Learned Court the existence of a legal and\n       binding Arbitration agreement by and between the parties,\n       surreptitiously suppressed by the plaintiff/respondent by not\n       coming clean and/or even succinctly aiming at the terms and\n       conditions of the agreement.

It is\n       evident from the record that a commercial transaction had taken\n       place between the parties in this regard. The defendant has\n       raised an objection regarding the lack of jurisdiction/hearing\n       authority of this court for the present suit, stating that based on\n       the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, any\n       dispute arising between the parties shall have sole jurisdiction\n       with the court located in Delhi. Therefore, the plaintiff&#x27;s suit is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                          (Downloaded on 24/04/2025 at 09:15:58 PM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JD:17797-DB]                        (8 of 16)                            [CMA-3045/2024]\n\n\n       liable    to    be   dismissed        due   to    lack    of     jurisdiction.    Upon\n       examination of the case record, it is observed that in paragraph\n       16 of the plaint, the plaintiff has stated facts asserting that the\n       jurisdiction for hearing and adjudication of the present suit lies\n       with the Commercial Court. The plaintiff has drawn the Court&#x27;s\n       attention to Clause 51 of the written agreement executed\n       between the parties, which specifies that jurisdiction shall vest in\n       the courts at the place where the agreement was executed. In\n       view of the mutually contradictory assertions made by both\n       parties in this regard, no conclusive opinion can be formed at this\n       stage.     It   would     be    appropriate       and     just     to    arrive   at   a\n       determination on this issue only after the parties have led their\n       evidence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">               Furthermore, when the defendant, in accordance with legal\n       procedure, raises such objections in its reply, it would be in line\n       with the principles of natural justice to frame issues accordingly\n       and arrive at a conclusion based on the evidence presented by\n       both parties. Therefore, at this preliminary stage, it cannot be\n       conclusively determined whether this Court has the territorial\n       jurisdiction or authority to hear and adjudicate the suit or not.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               It is also noteworthy that prior to filing the suit, the plaintiff\n       had initiated proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 12-A</a> of the Commercial\n       Courts Act before the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA).\n       However, due to the non-appearance of the defendant, the\n       matter was treated as a non-starter. At that stage, the defendant\n       had the opportunity to raise objections before the DLSA, Jodhpur,\n       but chose not to appear before the said authority. This conduct\n       reflects that the defendant was not inclined to participate in the\n       pre-institution      mediation        process. From the             aforementioned\n       conduct of the defendant, it is evident that the defendant was not\n       genuinely       interested       in     pursuing     mediation           proceedings.\n       Accordingly, the objection now raised by the defendant regarding\n       the appointment of a mediator is not tenable in light of the above\n       discussion and is not liable to be accepted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">               In conclusion, the application presented by the defendant\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1690450/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/310829/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 5</a> of the Arbitration and\n       Conciliation Act, 1996, read with <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_8\">Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of\n       Civil    Procedure</a>,       stands       dismissed.

As per sub-section (1), it is therefore absolutely essential for\n\nresorting to section 8 of A &amp; C Act that there is an agreement\n\nbetween the parties.

The preamble to A &amp; C Act, 1996 extensively refers to the\n\nUnited      Nations      Commission           on      International      Trade      Law\n\n(UNCITRAL) and the Model Rules. It refers to the significant\n\ncontributions      made      by     the     Model       Law      and   Rules   to   the\n\nestablishment of a unified legal framework for the fair and efficient\n\nsettlement of disputes arising in the international commercial\n\nrelations. It further mentions that it was expedient to make laws\n\nfor the arbitration and conciliation proceedings taking into account\n\nthe Model Law and Rules. Quite clearly, the legislative intention\n\nwas to bring the domestic and international commercial arbitration\n\nin line with the UNCITRAL Model Rules and the New York\n\nConvention and Geneva Convention. The main objective of A &amp; C\n\nAct is to make provision for an arbitral procedure which is fair and\n\nefficient while minimizing the supervisory role of the Courts in the\n\narbitral process. Section 5 of A &amp; C Act clearly brings out the\n\nobject behind enacting this new Act for encouraging expeditious\n\nresolution of dispute with less expenses. The non-obstante clause\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/310829/\" id=\"a_10\">section 5</a> provides that there shall be minimal judicial\n\ninterference as to the matters provided under Part-I even if there\n\nis anything contrary in force.

As noticed above, the concept of separability of the\n         arbitration clause/agreement from the underlying contract has\n         been statutorily recognised by this country under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 16</a> of\n         the Arbitration Act, 1996. Having provided for resolution of\n         disputes through arbitration, parties cannot be permitted to avoid\n         arbitration, without satisfying the Court that it will be just and in\n         the interest of all the parties not to proceed with the arbitration.\n         <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 5</a> of the Arbitration Act provides that the Court shall not\n         intervene in the arbitration process except in accordance with the\n         provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_14\">Part I of the Arbitration Act</a>. This policy of\n         least interference in arbitration proceedings recognises the\n         general principle that the function of courts in matters relating to\n         arbitration is to support arbitration process. A conjoint reading of\n         <a href=\"/doc/310829/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 16</a> would make it clear that all matters\n         including the issue as to whether the main contract was\n         void/voidable can be referred to arbitration. Otherwise, it would\n         be a handy tool available to the unscrupulous parties to avoid\n         arbitration, by raising the bogey of the underlying contract being\n\n         void.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">12.

However, the\n\nlearned Presiding Judge while dealing with the objection taken by\n\nthe appellant-company that the Court at Jodhpur shall have no\n\njurisdiction to deal with the present suit held that no decision at\n\nthat stage as regards jurisdiction of the Court can be rendered in\n\nview of the conflicting pleadings and stand taken by the rival\n\nparties. In our opinion, the Presiding Judge was not required to go\n\ninto the matter of jurisdiction and wrongly held that the issue of\n\njurisdiction can be decided on the basis of the evidence produced\n\nby the parties on framing of a specific issue on jurisdiction of the\n\nCourt. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996348\" id=\"span_12\">In &quot;<a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_19\">Mcdermott International Inc. v.

According to clause 23 of the Sub-\n\nletting contract dated 19th April 2017, the Sub-letting agreement\n\nshall be subject to the jurisdiction of only the Courts at Delhi.\n\nClause 24 provided that any difference or dispute arising out of or\n\nin connection with the sub-contract shall be adjudicated through\n\narbitration to be held at Delhi and as per the provisions of A &amp; C\n\nAct or any amendment thereof. Indisputably, clause 24 provided a\n\ndispute resolution mechanism whereunder the parties to the sub-\n\ncontract are required to make endeavors for resolution of any\n\ndifference or dispute through amicable settlement. It further\n\nprovided that if no amicable solution is explored by the parties\n\nthen their dispute shall be settled through arbitration by a panel of\n\nthree arbitrators. The manner in which the arbitrators shall be\n\nappointed is also provided under clause 24. In &quot;Hindustan\n\nPetroleum Corporation Ltd. v. M/s Pinkcity Midway Petroleums&quot;4,\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that it is mandatory for the civil\n\nCourt to refer the disputes to the arbitrator if a party before the\n\ncivil Court contends that there is a clause for arbitration in the\n\nagreement between the parties. With reference to section 16 of\n\nA &amp; C Act, &quot;Hindustan Petroleum&quot; further decided the question\n\n\n3   2013 (1) SCC 641\n4   (2003) 6 SCC 503\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                        (Downloaded on 24/04/2025 at 09:15:58 PM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JD:17797-DB]                 (14 of 16)                    [CMA-3045/2024]\n\n\nraised by a party relating to non-applicability of the arbitration\n\nclause. It was ruled that <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_22\">section 16</a> empowers the arbitral Tribunal\n\nto decide the question of jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to rule\n\nand to decide any objection with respect to the existence or\n\nvalidity of the arbitration agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">15.   We must further indicate that the dispute arising between\n\nthe appellant-company and the respondent no.1 does not involve\n\nthe Public Health Engineering Department which is the Employer\n\nunder the agreement dated 18th September 2012. Clause 51 of the\n\nagreement dated 18th September 2012 provided that any dispute\n\narising between the parties in respect of any of the matters\n\nincluded in the agreement shall be settled by a competent Court\n\nhaving jurisdiction over the place where the agreement was\n\nexecuted and by no other Court. Having been so provided, clause\n\n51 of the said agreement shall have no application to decide the\n\njurisdiction of the Court when the dispute is not between the\n\nappellant-company with the Employer. Leaving aside this issue,\n\nthe finding of the Commercial Court cannot be countenanced in\n\nlaw, that the appellant-company did not participate in the pre-\n\ninstitution mediation and thus demonstrated by its conduct that it\n\nwas not interested in resolution of the dispute through arbitration\n\nand therefore the application seeking reference to arbitration was\n\nliable to be rejected. Even if it is assumed that pre-institution\n\nmediation is mandatory, the dispute between the parties could\n\nhave been resolved only when they would have arrived at a\n\nmutually agreed solution and not otherwise. In our opinion, the\n\nobject behind incorporating section 12-A in the <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_23\">Commercial Courts\n\nAct, 2015</a> is to provide a forum for the aggrieved party to seek\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                        (Downloaded on 24/04/2025 at 09:15:58 PM)</span>\n [2025:RJ-JD:17797-DB]                        (15 of 16)                       [CMA-3045/2024]\n\n\namicable settlement of the dispute in the first instance and then\n\nonly to approach the Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1985028\" id=\"span_17\">Non participation of the appellant-\n\ncompany in pre-institution mediation proceedings cannot debar it\n\nfrom seeking reference to arbitration in terms of clauses 23 and\n\n24 of the Sub-letting agreement dated 19th April 2017. The\n\nCommercial Court did not appreciate that the language of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_24\">section\n\n8</a> is peremptory in nature and it is obligatory for the Court to refer\n\nthe parties to arbitration in terms of their arbitration agreement in\n\ncases where there is an arbitration clause5. It further failed to\n\nappreciate that after an application under section 8 of A &amp; C Act is\n\nmade nothing remains to be decided in the original action except\n\nto refer the dispute to an arbitrator. We may also refer to the\n\ndecision in &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1985028/\" id=\"a_25\">Ravi Prakash Goel v. Chandra Prakash Goel &amp; Anr.</a>&quot;6,\n\nwherein the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that the parties cannot\n\nbe compelled to take recourse to the civil Court if the dispute is\n\nreferable to arbitration. In view thereof, the Commercial Court\n\ncommitted serious error in law in refusing to entertain the\n\napplication moved by the appellant-company seeking a reference\n\nto arbitration and the reasoning so provided by the Commercial\n\nCourt to dismiss such application is clearly erroneous and cannot\n\nbe countenanced in law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1703962\" id=\"span_18\">16.     For the foregoing reasons, the order dated 12th September\n\n2024 passed in contravention to the mandatory provisions under\n\nsection 8 of A &amp; C Act is set aside.
