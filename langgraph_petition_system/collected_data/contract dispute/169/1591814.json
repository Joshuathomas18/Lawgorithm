A bare comparison of clause 30 of the\n            contract agreement involved in the present\n            matter and clauses 23 and 24 involved in\n            <a href=\"/doc/1707042/\" id=\"a_8\">Bharat Bhushan Bansal</a> case would show that\n            they are not identical. Whereas clause 30 of the\n            agreement in question provides for resolution\n            of the dispute arising out of the contract by\n            persons named therein; in terms of clause 24,\n            there was no question of decision by a named\n            person in the dispute raised by the parties to the\n            agreement.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1707042\" id=\"span_7\">The matters which are specified\n            under clauses 23 and 24 in <a href=\"/doc/1707042/\" id=\"a_9\">Bharat Bhushan\n            Bansal</a> case were necessarily not required to\n            arise out of the contract, but merely claims\n            arising during performance of the contract.\n            Clause 30 of the agreement in the present case\n            did provide for resolution of the dispute arising\n            out of the contract by the Superintending\n            Engineer, Gulbarga Circle, Gulbarga. For that\n            reason, the case relied upon by the learned\n            counsel for the respondent is distinguishable.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            16. Once clause 30 is constituted to be a valid\n            arbitration agreement, it would necessarily\n            follow that the decision of the arbitrator named\n            therein would be rendered only upon allowing\n            the parties to adduce evidence in support of\n            their respective claims and counter-claims as\n            also upon hearing the parties to the dispute. For\n            the purpose of constituting the valid arbitration\n            agreement, it is not necessary that the\n            conditions as regards adduction of evidence by\n            the parties or giving an opportunity of hearing\n            to them must specifically be mentioned therein.\n            Such conditions, it is trite, are implicit in the\n            decision-making process in the arbitration\n            proceedings. Compliance with the principles of\n            natural justice inheres in an arbitration process.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                      5</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">They, irrespective of the fact as to whether\nrecorded specifically in the arbitration\nagreement or not are required to be followed.\nOnce the principles of natural justice are not\ncomplied with, the award made by the arbitrator\nwould be rendered invalid. We, therefore, are of\nthe opinion that the arbitration clause does not\nnecessitate spelling out of a duty on the part of\nthe arbitrator to hear both parties before\ndeciding the question before him. The\nexpression &quot;decision&quot; subsumes adjudication of\nthe dispute. Here in the instant case, it will bear\nrepetition to state, that the disputes between the\nparties arose out of a contract and in relation to\nmatters specified therein and, thus, were\nrequired to be decided and such decisions are\nnot only final and binding on the parties, but\nthey are conclusive which clearly spells out the\nfinality of such decisions as also their binding\nnature.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">17. A clause which is inserted in a contract\nagreement for the purpose of prevention of\ndispute will not be an arbitration agreement.\nSuch a provision has been made in the\nagreement itself by conferring power upon the\nEngineer-in-Charge to take a decision\nthereupon in relation to the matters envisaged\nunder clauses 31 and 32 of the said agreement.\nClauses 31 and 32 of the said agreement\nprovide for a decision of the Engineer-in-\nCharge in relation to the matters specified\ntherein. The jurisdiction of the Engineer-in-\nCharge in relation to such matters are limited\nand they cannot be equated with an arbitration\nagreement. Despite such clauses meant for\nprevention of dispute arising out of a contract,\nsignificantly, clause 30 has been inserted in the\ncontract agreement by the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">18. The very fact that clause 30 has been\ninserted by the parties despite the clauses for\nprevention of dispute is itself a pointer to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                  6</span>\n\n            fact that the parties to the contract were ad\n            idem that the dispute and differences arising out\n            of or under the contract should be determined\n            by a domestic tribunal chosen by them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      Appellant thereafter filed an application in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> of\n\nthe Act before the Principal Civil Court on 8.12.2003. The same was\n\nheld to be barred by limitation.

The prohibitory provision has\nto be construed strictly. It is true that the\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_35\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>\nintended to expedite commercial issues\nexpeditiously. It is also clear in the Statement\nof Objects and Reasons that in order to\nrecognise economic reforms the settlement of\nboth domestic and international commercial\ndisputes should be disposed of quickly so that\nthe country&#x27;s economic progress be expedited.\nThe Statement of Objects and Reasons also\nnowhere indicates that <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 14</a> of the\nLimitation Act shall be excluded. But on the\ncontrary, intendment of the legislature is\napparent in the present case as <a href=\"/doc/1724405/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 43</a> of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 applies\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_38\">Limitation Act, 1963</a> as a whole. It is only\nby virtue of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/372189/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 29</a> of the\nLimitation Act that its operation is excluded to\nthat extent of the area which is covered under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_40\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>. Our\nattention was also invited to the various\ndecisions of this Court interpreting sub-section\n(2) of <a href=\"/doc/372189/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 29</a> of the Limitation Act with\nreference to other Acts like the <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_42\">Representation\nof the People Act</a> or the provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_43\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> where separate period\nof limitation has been prescribed. We need not\noverburden the judgment with reference to\nthose cases because it is very clear to us by\nvirtue of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/372189/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 29</a> of the\nLimitation Act that the provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_45\">Limitation Act</a> shall stand excluded in the Act\nof 1996 to the extent of area which is covered\nby the Act of 1996. In the present case under\nSection 34 by virtue of sub-section (3) only the\napplication for filing and setting aside the\naward a period has been prescribed as 3 months\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                   10</span>\n\n             and delay can be condoned to the extent of 30\n             days. To this extent the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/100581/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n             5</a> of the Limitation Act will stand excluded but\n             there is no provision in the Act of 1996 which\n             excludes operation of <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 14</a> of the\n             Limitation Act. If two Acts can be read\n             harmoniously without doing violation to the\n             words used therein, then there is no prohibition\n             in doing so.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9480\" id=\"span_19\">The <a href=\"/doc/434621/\" id=\"a_48\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/434621/\" id=\"a_49\">laid down in</a></a> <a href=\"/doc/434621/\" id=\"a_50\">the said decision</a> has since been reiterated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/9480/\" id=\"a_51\">Union of India &amp; Anr. v.

Western Builders</a>, (2006)\n             6 SCC 239, held that <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 14</a> of\n             the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable in\n             the Arbitration and Conciliation proceedings.\n             Having gone through the various facts, we are\n             of the view that the mistake committed by the\n             appellant in approaching        the    Madhya\n             Pradesh High Court and the Bombay\n             High Court is bona fide.        We, therefore,\n             condone the delay. In the facts of this\n             case and in the interest of justice, we,\n             however, think it proper that the Section\n             34 Application pending before the Additional\n             District Judge, Gwalior be transferred to the\n             Bombay High Court. The application will be\n             decided on merits expeditiously.

The proviso\n\nappended thereto empowers the court to entertain an application despite\n\nexpiry of the period of limitation specified therein, namely, three months.\n\nNo provision, however, exists as regards application of <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 14</a> of the\n\nLimitation Act. This Court, as noticed hereinbefore in Western Builders\n\nopined that sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/372189/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 29</a> thereof would apply to an\n\narbitration proceedings and consequently <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation\n\nAct would also be applicable. We are bound by <a href=\"/doc/1330198/\" id=\"a_59\">the said decision</a>. Once\n\nit is held that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963\n\nwould apply, it must be held that the learned Trial Judge as also the High\n\nCourt has committed an error in not applying the said provisions.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">      The question, however, as to whether the period spent by the\n\nappellant in prosecuting the aforementioned proceedings should be\n\nexcluded or not is a matter which must fall for decision before the\n\nPrincipal Civil Court. The necessary corollary of the aforementioned\n\nfinding is that as to whether the appellant had been prosecuting, with due\n\ndiligence another proceeding or not would fall for consideration before\n\nthe Principal Civil Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                   12</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">      The impugned judgment of the High Court, therefore, cannot be\n\nsustained.
