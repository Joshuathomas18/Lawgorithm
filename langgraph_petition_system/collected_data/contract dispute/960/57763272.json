It   was \n\ncontended that since the Respondent went on purchasing Guar Seeds and since \n\nthe   Petitioner   did   not   make   the   balance   payment   on   account   of   which   the \n\nRespondent had suffered financial loss, it was therefore, denied there was any \n\ndebt due to the Petitioner.  A reference was also made in the said affidavit to \n\nthe investigation conducted by the Director General, Competition Commission \n\nof India (for short &quot;the DG CCI&quot;)   in Case No.76 of 2012 pertaining to the \n\nsharp   rise   in   the   price   of   Guar   Seeds   during   the   period   October   2011   and \n\nMarch 2012.   In the said reply affidavit it is stated that various observations \n\nwere made by the DG CCI during the course of investigation into the operation \n\nof Ruchi Group [to which the Petitioner and the other Petitioners belong].  It \n\nwas further stated in the said affidavit that the investigation reveals that the \n\nfunds received by the Respondent Company from the 9 Petitioners were for \n\n\nlgc                                                                                         13 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                               app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\npurchase of Guar Seeds.  A reference has been made to paragraph 5.12.15 of \n\nthe investigation report.  It was therefore the case of the Respondent that the \n\nfunds received pertain to the supply of Guar Seeds and not for Soyabean Meal \n\nextract.  The factum of supply of Guar Seeds during the period 2011-2012 and \n\nits   acceptance   against   the   advance   without   any   objection/reservation   was \n\nstated.     A   reference   is   made   to   the   four   Petitioners   in   Company   Petition \n\nNos.586 of 2014, 756 of 2015, 759 of 2015 and 760 of 2015 against whom it is \n\nthe case of the Respondent that against the advances paid, certain quantities of \n\nGuar Seeds were supplied and that is how the balance amounts are shown \n\nagainst each of the said Petitioners.  The discrepancy between various contracts \n\ndates supply dates as also the discrepancy in the numbers of the contracts was \n\nstated so as to highlight the case of the Respondent that there were no such \n\ncontracts for supply of Soyabean Meal.   The Respondent accordingly sought \n\ndismissal   of   the   above   Company   Petition   as   also   the   companion   Company \n\nPetitions. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\n\n7              An   affidavit   in   rejoinder   was   filed   on   behalf   of   the   Petitioner \n\nwherein the Petitioner reiterated its stand in the Company Petition. \n\n\n\n8              The learned Single Judge as indicated above has by the impugned \n\norder dated 17th/18th  October 2016 has disposed of the Company Petition as \n\nalso   the   companion   Company   Petitions   by   issuing   directions   which   are \n\n\nlgc                                                                                         14 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                                 app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\ncontained   in   the   operative   part   amongst   which   as   indicated   above   is   the \n\ndirection for the Respondent to deposit the advances paid by the Petitioner and \n\nthe other Petitioners in the companion Company Petitions to the Respondent in \n\nthis Court within 12 weeks.

The   learned   Single   Judge   further   held   that   the \n\ncontention that these are all fabricated and designed to reflect data matching \n\nthe   credit   balances   is   farfetched.       The   learned   Single   Judge   has   further \n\n\nlgc                                                                                           15 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                             ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                               app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\nobserved that the denial of the contracts&#x27; authenticity appears to be a feeble \n\nattempt to avoid liability and the consequences that follow.  The learned Single \n\nJudge has observed that the signatures of Mr. Bothra - the deponent of the \n\naffidavit in reply which are on the contracts have not been denied.   Having \n\nregard to the dispute raised by the Respondent as regards the authenticity of \n\nthe e-mails  the learned Single Judge was of the view that the denial appearing \n\nis bare and bereft of particulars.  The learned Single Judge has observed that \n\nthough  on  the  one  hand  the  Respondent  has alleged  that  the   contracts  are \n\nfabricated and data is created to match the credit balances,  but on the other \n\nhand denies having sent any e-mail as annexed by the Petitioner.  The learned \n\nSingle Judge has taken into consideration the fact that after the affidavit in \n\nreply   was   filed   on   behalf   of   the   Respondent,   inspection   of   the   e-mail(s) \n\nforwarding the said five contracts was taken.   The copies of the said e-mails \n\nhave   been   annexed   at   Exhibit-G1   and   G2.     The   learned   Single   Judge   has \n\nobserved that apart from stating that the contracts are fabricated and that they \n\nhad not sent any mail, there is no attempt on the part of the Respondent to \n\ndispute   the   signature   or   the   rubber   stamp   appearing   on   the   e-mails.     The \n\nlearned Single Judge has observed that the e-mails have originated from one \n\nMr.   Sujit/Betul   Oils   Ltd.   whose   e-mail   address   has   been   referred   to   by   the \n\nlearned Single Judge.  However, according to the learned Single Judge the fact \n\nremains   that   the   deponent   has   not   contended   that   the   Respondent   has   not \n\ncommunicated through M/s. Betul Oils Ltd. (the group to which the Appellant \n\n\nlgc                                                                                         16 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                             app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\nbelongs)   The learned Single Judge has further observed that the signatures on \n\nthe attachments of the e-mails have not been disputed nor has the Respondent \n\ndisputed the fact that the rubber stamp appearing on these attachments.  The \n\nlearned   Single   Judge   has   also   adverted   to   the   fact   that   the   Chartered \n\nAccountants of the Company were directed to remain present along with the \n\nDirector   of   the   Respondent   Company.       Accordingly   Mr.   D   Narsimhan   the \n\nDirector   of   the   Respondent   Company   and   Mr.  P   Bhargava   of   the   Chartered \n\nAccountants of the Respondent Company appeared before the Court and stated \n\nthat the amounts paid by the Petitioners in the said Company Petitions were \n\nshown   as   advances   received   in   their   account   as   on   that   date   i.e.   on \n\n26/02/2015.  The learned Single Judge therefore held that if the amounts paid \n\nby the Petitioners were appropriated by the Respondent towards the price of \n\nGuar   Seeds   ordered   by   the   Petitioners,   the   amounts   would   not   have   been \n\nshown   as   advance   as   on   26/02/2015.     The   learned   Single   Judge   has   also \n\nobserved that the Respondent has not filed any proceedings against any of the \n\nPetitioners to recover the loss alleged to have been caused on account of they \n\nbeing   allegedly   induced   to   purchase   large   quantities   of   Guar   Seeds   at   the \n\ninstance of the Petitioners. The learned Single Judge having regard to all the \n\naforesaid facts prima facie found that the defence set up by the Respondent \n\ndoes not appear to be bonafide.   The learned Single Judge has observed that \n\nhaving regard to the fact that the Respondent has received the amount paid \n\nover by the Petitioners coupled with the fact that the Respondent has not relied \n\n\nlgc                                                                                       17 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                              app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\nupon any evidence of having purchased any quantities of Guar Seeds pursuant \n\nto the alleged repeated orders to purchase the Guar Seeds, the defence of the \n\nRespondent was not a plausible one.   The learned Single Judge therefore as \n\nindicated above deemed it appropriate to direct the Respondent to deposit in \n\nthis   Court   the   amount   claimed   by   way   of   the   statutory   notices   by   the \n\nPetitioners   in   the   above   Company   Petition   as   also   the   Petitioners   in   other \n\ncompanion Company Petitions.

There   is   no   reference   to   any   e-\n\nmail/letter/correspondence by which the said Guar Seeds contracts were sent \n\nto the Petitioners.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n16             Another aspect which dents the case of the Respondent in so far as \n\nthe said defence is concerned is that its Director  Mr. D Narsimhan  and the \n\nrepresentative of the Chartered Accountants of the Respondent Mr. P Bhargava \n\nhave admitted before this Court that the amounts paid by the Petitioners are \n\nshown as advance received in the account of the Respondent which fact has \n\nbeen recorded in the order dated 23/02/2015 and 27/02/2015 passed in one \n\nof   the   connected   Company   Petition   being   No.16   of   2014.

A reading of the said e-mail indicates that the said \n\ne-mail is in the nature of the proposal to the Respondent that the advances can \n\nbe adjusted against the Gaur Seeds. The alleged Guar Seeds contracts are all \n\nprior in point of time to the e-mail.  Hence there would be no question of Mr. \n\nRajkumar Goyal making a proposal for purchase of Guar Seeds to be adjusted \n\nwith the advances provided by the Petitioner.   The said e-mail therefore does \n\nnot   in   any   manner   support   the   case   of   the   Respondent   that   the   amount \n\nadvanced   by   the   Petitioner   was   towards   the   purchase   of   Guar   Seeds.   The \n\nfactum of supply of Guar Seeds to 5 entities which are sister concerns of the \n\nPetitioner also does not further case of the Respondent in so far as contracts \n\nbeing   for   purchase   Guar   Seeds   and   not   for   purchase   of   Soyabean   Meal   is \n\nconcerned.  The contracts relating to Guar Seeds, according to the Respondent \n\nare dated 14/01/2012 whilst the Guar Seeds are alleged to have been supplied \n\neven prior to the contract date i.e. 28/11/2011.   It is only in respect of the \n\nalleged Guar Seeds contract between the Respondent and M/s. Nova Trading \n\nPvt. Ltd. (one of the Respondents in the companion Appeals) that the contract \n\n\nlgc                                                                                      32 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                        ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                                  app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\ndate   is   prior   to   the   delivery   date.     Hence   the   aforesaid   fact   also   does   not \n\nsupport   the   case   of   the   Respondent   that   the   contracts   were   in   respect   of \n\npurchase of Guar Seeds and not for purchase of Soyabean Meal.\n\n\n\n18              Now coming to the report of the DG CCI on which much reliance \n\nwas sought to be placed on behalf of the Respondent in support of its case that \n\nthe contracts were in respect of supply of Guar Seeds and not for Soyabean \n\nMeal.  The said report has been submitted by the DG CCI after undertaking an \n\ninquiry under <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 26</a> of the Competition Act 2002.  The statutory scheme \n\ncomprising the said Act indicates that the investigation carried out by the DG \n\nCCI is a preliminary fact finding inquiry and is not by way of quasi-judicial \n\nproceeding.  In the said fact finding inquiry there is no opportunity given to the \n\nconcerned parties to make submissions but only statements are recorded and \n\nmaterial considered.  In so far as the instant report of the DG CCI is concerned, \n\nreading of paragraphs 5.12.10, 5.12.11 and 5.12.14 indicate that the DG CCI&#x27;s \n\nfinding is solely based on the bank statements of the parties.  The DG CCI did \n\nnot have the benefit of the material facts which are necessary to determine the \n\ninter se disputes between the parties.  In so far as the instant case is concerned, \n\nthe DG CCI did not have access to the Soyabean Meal contracts bearing the \n\nsignature and rubber stamp of the Respondent i.e. the Appellant herein, the e-\n\nmail through which the Respondent forwarded the Soyabean Meal contracts to \n\nthe Petitioners, admissions of Mr. D Narsimhan the Director of the Respondent \n\n\nlgc                                                                                           33 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                             ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                                app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\nand, Mr. P Bhargava the representative of the Chartered Accountants of the \n\nRespondent wherein they have stated that the amount paid by the Petitioner \n\nwas shown as advance in the account of the Respondent.  The DG CCI cannot \n\nbe said to be conducting any inquiry as regards the inter se disputes between \n\nthe Petitioner and the Respondent but was only conducting the inquiry into \n\nwhether there was any monopolistic activities being carried out in the sale of \n\nGuar Seeds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n19             In our view, though the learned Single Judge has not expressed \n\nany opinion one way or the other as regards the efficacy of any of the findings \n\nrecorded by the DG CCI, no evidentiary value could be attached to the said \n\nreport of the DG CCI.  Reliance placed on the judgment of Raymond Woollen  \n\nMills Ltd.&#x27;s case (supra) seems to be apposite.  In the said case the Apex Court \n\nwas concerned with the investigation report under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1147316/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a> \n\nof the Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 which provisions can \n\nbe said to be almost paramateria to <a href=\"/doc/1720913/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 26</a> of the present <a href=\"/doc/1113485/\" id=\"a_23\">Competition Act, \n\n2002</a>.    The  Apex Court  held that  any  reference  to  the   contents of  the  said \n\nreport which have not been put in evidence and subjected to cross examination \n\ncannot   be   looked   into.   Paragraph   36   of   the   said   report   is   material   and   is \n\nreproduced herein under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">               36.

It is only \n               a report submitted in terms of Section 11 of the MRTP \n               Act for initiating the enquiry. Only those facts contained \n               therein, which are proved on record by evidence, can be \n               looked   into.   The   preliminary   investigation   report,   as \n               such, is not evidence on record.

As   indicated   above   the   Respondent   has   not   denied   the \n\nauthenticity   of   the   signature   and   its   rubber   stamp   on   the   Soyabean   Meal \n\ncontracts.     Since   the   Soyabean   Meal   contracts   have   originated   from   the \n\nRespondent, the discrepancies if any cannot lie at the door of the Petitioner \n\nand it is for the Respondent therefore to explain such discrepancies.  Hence the \n\ncase of the Respondent that the Soyabean Meal contracts are fabricated and \n\nthat the Respondent did not send any e-mail does not seem to be bonafide and \n\n\nlgc                                                                                        35 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                          ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                             app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\nis devoid of merits as rightly held by the learned Single Judge.   In our view, \n\nmerely because the Petitioner did not enter into correspondence though breach \n\nwas committed by the Respondent would not dent the case of the Petitioner in \n\nso far as their claim based on Soyabean Meal contracts is concerned.  Since the \n\nparties had a running business relationship, it may be possible that the parties \n\nwere trying to work out and in the said process time might have elapsed.  In \n\nthe said context it is required to be noted that even in respect of the Guar Seed \n\ncontracts the delivery date as per the said contracts was 27/07/2012.   The \n\nRespondent   did   not   address   any   correspondence   for   almost   a   year   before \n\naddressing the letter dated 15/06/2013.  Hence the aforesaid fact suggests that \n\nthe   parties   being   in   continuous   business   relationship   did   not   desire   to \n\nprecipitate the matter and were trying to resolve the same.  \n\n\n\n21             The contention as urged on behalf of the Respondent that the e-\n\nmails   do   not   contain   the   signature   made   on   behalf   of   the   Petitioner   and \n\ntherefore the said fact impinges upon whether there were any contracts for \n\npurchase of Soyabean Meal.  In our view, the said contention misses the point \n\nthat the said contract was acted upon inasmuch as the Petitioner had made \n\npayment of the advance which constituted 50% of the contracted amount i.e. \n\nthe sum of Rs.51,00,00,000/- and hence in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1911494/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> of the Contract \n\nAct the same constitutes an acceptance. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_10\">lgc                                                                                       36 of 42\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">        ::: Uploaded on - 08/12/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 10/12/2017 01:54:12 :::</span>\n                                                                app-131.17-aw-nma-29.17&amp;ors\n\n22             In so far as the order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court is \n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">concerned,   it   seems   that   the   parties   and   the   contracts   in   issue   before   the \n\nMadhya Pradesh High Court were different. In the said case it appears that the \n\nRespondent therein Betul Oils Ltd had produced the contract for purchase of \n\nGuar Seeds bearing the signature of M/s. Nova Trading Pvt. Ltd.; whereas in \n\nthe instant case the Respondent has failed to produce any such Guar Seeds \n\ncontracts.     Further   before   the   Madhya   Pradesh   High   Court   there   was   no \n\nadmissions as are in the present case by the Director Mr. D Narsimhan and the \n\nrepresentative of the Chartered Accountants Mr. P Bhargava.  In so far as the \n\nsaid   order   passed   by   the   Madhya   Pradesh   High   Court   is   concerned,   it   is \n\nrequired   to   be   noted   that   the   Review   Petition   being   No.1   of   2017   filed   in \n\nCompany Petition No.586 of 2014 came to be filed by the Respondent on the \n\nsaid   very   ground   i.e.   placing   reliance   on   the   order   passed   by   the   Madhya \n\nPradesh High Court dismissing the Company Petition.

Appellate Court will not reassess \n               the material and seek to reach a conclusion different \n               from   the   one   reached   by   the   court   below   if   the   one \n               reached   by   the   court   was   reasonably   possible   on   the \n               material.

If   the   discretion   has \n               been exercised by the Trial Court reasonably and in a \n               judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would \n               have taken a different view may not justify interference \n               with   the   trial   court&#x27;s   exercise   of   discretion.
