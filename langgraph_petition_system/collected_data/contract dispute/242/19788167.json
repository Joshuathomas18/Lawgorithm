Jha, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">       Both these petitions arise out of the same factual\n\ndispute      and,        therefore,     are     heard       and      decided\n\nconcomitantly by a common order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">2.     W.P No.7805/2016 has been filed by petitioner\n\nJanak Healthcare Private Ltd., being aggrieved by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 2        W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\ncommunication dated 22.1.2016 and the email received\n\nby them on 21.4.2016 cancelling the notification of\n\naward     and   the   tender   proceedings   in   which   the\n\npetitioner was the successful bidder. The petitioner has\n\nalso challenged the subsequent tender notice dated\n\n7.4.2016 issued by the respondents inviting application\n\nfrom prospective suppliers for the same items for which\n\nthe petitioner had been found to be the successful\n\nbidder.    W.P No.16746/2016 has been filed by the\n\npetitioner Godrej &amp; Boycen Mfg. Co. Ltd., praying for a\n\ndirection to award the contract to the petitioner therein\n\ninstead of the petitioner in W.P No.7805/2016 or in the\n\nalternative, to re-tender the 9 items that were included\n\nin the previous tender proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.   It   is pertinent to note that this Court by interim\n\norder dated 13.5.2016 had stayed further proceedings to\n\nbe taken up by the respondents pursuant to the\n\nsubsequent tender notice dated 7.4.2016.           However,\n\nlater on the aforesaid interim order was modified with\n\nthe consent of the learned counsel for the parties and\n\nthe interim order was restricted to the 9 items involved\n\nin W.P No.7805/2016.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               3            W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                 16746/2016</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.   The brief facts, leading to the filing of both these\n\npetitions, are that the respondent State Public Health\n\nService Corporation issued a tender notice on 15.5.2015\n\ninviting online tender proceedings for annual rate\n\ncontract and supply of Maternal &amp; Child Health and other\n\nequipment and instruments to various hospitals of Govt.\n\nof M.P. for a period of one year from the date of signing\n\nof the contract. It is stated that 34 bidders responded to\n\nthe aforesaid online tenders. However, as many as 32\n\nbidders were not found eligible and only two bidders\n\nnamely; the petitioner in W.P No.7805/20016 and the\n\npetitioner in W.P No.16746/2016 where shortlisted.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.   Though various dates have been mentioned by the\n\npetitioner in the petitions, the relevant dates material for\n\ndeciding the controversy raised before this Court are\n\nthat after several extensions of time to submit the bid,\n\nthe last date for submitting the bid was notified as\n\n31.8.2015 whereafter certain proceedings were taken up\n\nby the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">6.   It is stated that on 03.11.2015 the respondents,\n\ninstead of proceedings further in the matter, asked the\n\npetitioner   in   W.P.No.7805/2016    to     refurnish    their\n\nfinancial    bids     to   which     the     petitioner          in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 4             W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                    16746/2016</span>\n\nW.P.No.7805/2016 filed an objection on 09.12.2015. It is\n\nstated that ultimately after analyzing all the bids the\n\npetitioner in W.P.No.7805/2016, Janak Health Care, was\n\nfound to be the lowest bidder and a notification of award\n\n(NOA) was issued to the petitioner Janak Health Care on\n\n31.12.2015. Subsequently, a revised NOA was again\n\nissued to the petitioner Janak Health Care on 13.01.2016\n\nasking       the petitioner to furnish the earnest money\n\ndeposited and to execute an agreement within 21 days.\n\nOn 21.01.2016 the petitioner            Janak Health Care\n\nsubmitted      a   Bank   Guarantee    as   well    as   a    draft\n\nagreement as required by the authorities. However, on\n\nthe very next day i.e. 22.01.2016 they were served with\n\nan order passed by the respondents informing it that it\n\nwas in fact not the lowest bidder but was L-2 and was\n\nalso informed and directed to keep on hold further\n\nproceedings in the rate contract and the NOA issued to\n\nthem. The petitioner Janak Health Care being aggrieved,\n\nfiled    a   representation   before    the     authorities     on\n\n18.03.2016, but no steps were taken by the respondents.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">7.       It is submitted that in the meanwhile from\n\n21.03.2016 onwards the petitioner Janak Health Care\n\nhaving been issued the NOA, started receiving orders\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                              5         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                             16746/2016</span>\n\nfrom various purchasing authorities from all over M.P.\n\nand supplied the necessary Maternal and Child Health\n\nEquipments and Instruments to various hospitals in the\n\nState of M.P. and others for a sum of about Rs.60 lakhs.\n\nIt is submitted that while the petitioner was doing so\n\nthey were shocked to find out that the respondents had\n\nissued a fresh Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) on 07.04.2016\n\ninviting bids for the same items and for the same period\n\nfor which the NOA had been issued to the petitioner and,\n\ntherefore, the petitioner immediately approached the\n\nrespondent authorities whereafter they were served with\n\nthe impugned order dated 21.04.2016 terminating their\n\nNOA and the tender proceedings. The petitioner Janak\n\nHealth   Care   being   aggrieved   have   filed   W.P.No.\n\n7805/2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">8.   The petitioner in W.P.No.16746/2016 Godrej &amp;\n\nBoyce, while reiterating the same facts, has stated that\n\nGodrej &amp; Boyce was in fact the lowest bidder and was\n\nfound to be L-1 in the impugned tender proceedings.\n\nHowever, on objections being filed by Janak Health Care,\n\nthe petitioner in W.P.No.7805/2016, and on certain\n\nobjections being raised by the petitioner Godrej &amp; Boyce,\n\nagainst Janak Health Care, the authorities found that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                     6            W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                       16746/2016</span>\n\npetitioner Godrej &amp; Boyce did not fulfill the necessary\n\neligibility   qualifications   and,       therefore,     disqualified\n\nGodrej &amp; Boyce and issued the NOA in favour of Janak\n\nHealth Care on 31.12.2015, which was subsequently\n\nrevised on 13.01.2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">9.    It is submitted that the disqualification of the\n\npetitioner Godrej &amp; Boyce was illegal and the award of\n\ncontract      to   Janak   Health       Care,   the    petitioner      in\n\nW.P.No.7805/2016, was contrary to law as the petitioner\n\nGodrej &amp; Boyce was in fact the lowest bidder and was\n\nentitled to be awarded the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">10. The respondents have filed a return and have\n\nstated that though there were 34 bidders who responded\n\nto the online tender invited by them in reference to\n\ntender No. 29/2015, however as many as 32 of the\n\nbidders were found to be ineligible and were, therefore,\n\ndisqualified. It is submitted that ultimately 2 bids were\n\nshort-listed, namely, Godrej &amp; Boyce,             the petitioner in\n\nW.P.No.16746/2016, who was L-1 and Janak Health Care,\n\nthe petitioner in W.P.No.7805/2016 who was L-2. It is\n\nsubmitted that objections were filed by both the\n\npetitioners before the authorities against each other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               7            W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                 16746/2016</span>\n\nwhich related to the technical qualifications prescribed\n\nby the respondents in the tender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">11. It is submitted that on examining the matter the\n\nrespondents found that Godrej &amp; Boyce did not possess\n\nthe necessary European CE Certificate and, therefore,\n\nafter finding that Godrej &amp; Boyce was not qualified as per\n\nthe tender conditions even though they were the lowest\n\nbidder, the notification of award was issued in favour of\n\nJanak Health Care Private Ltd., petitioner in W.P.\n\nNo.7805/2016, on 31.12.2015. It is submitted that later\n\non, as it was found that the rates in respect of the items\n\nhad not been properly computed by including the tax\n\nelements   etc., a revised NOA was issued to petitioner\n\nJanak Health Care on 13.01.2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">12. The respondents have not disputed the fact that\n\npursuant to issuance of the revised NOA on 13.1.2016,\n\nthe   petitioner   Janak   Health   Care     deposited      the\n\nperformance bank guarantee on 21.01.2016 and also\n\nsubmitted a signed proforma of the contract agreement\n\nbefore the authorities. They have, however, submitted\n\nthat thereafter objections were filed by petitioner Godrej\n\n&amp; Boyce and, subsequently, an audit objection was also\n\nraised by the Directorate of Audit &amp; Accounts of M.P. in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               8             W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                  16746/2016</span>\n\nrespect of the issuance of NOA to the petitioner Janak\n\nHealth   Care   on   the   ground    that    in   the    tender\n\nproceedings only one bidder remained in the fray and,\n\ntherefore, there was no competitive bidding as such in\n\nview of the CVC guidelines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">13. It is submitted that in view of the aforesaid aspects,\n\nthe respondent authorities, in their meeting held on\n\n03.03.2016, took a decision to cancel the entire tender\n\nproceedings and go in for fresh tender proceedings,\n\ntherefore,   the     impugned       communication         dated\n\n21.04.2016 was issued to the petitioner Janak Health\n\nCare informing it about the decision and cancelling the\n\nNOA issued in their favour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">14. It is submitted that as the decision to cancel the\n\ntender proceedings has been taken by the respondent\n\nauthorities on 03.03.2016, therefore, the respondents\n\nlooking to the urgency of purchasing the health care\n\nequipments immediately went in for issuing a fresh\n\ntender notice on 7.4.2016 which has also been assailed\n\nby the petitioners in the present petitions. The learned\n\nSenior Counsel appearing for the respondents submits\n\nthat in such circumstances no fault can be found with the\n\naction taken by them or the impugned orders issued by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                               9         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                              16746/2016</span>\n\nthem which are the subject matter of challenge in the\n\npresent petitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">15. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondents,\n\nobjecting to the maintainability of the petitions, submits\n\nthat the petitions filed by the petitioners deserve to be\n\ndismissed on account the availability of the Arbitration\n\nClause in the contract and the petitioners be directed to\n\ninvoke the same. It is submitted that even otherwise, as\n\nthe present petitions relate to a purely contractual\n\ndispute, the petitioners be directed to approach the Civil\n\nCourt and the petitions be dismissed as the issues raised\n\nherein cannot be decided in a writ petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7338589\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27844805\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"899629\" id=\"span_19\">16. The learned Senior Counsel for the respondents\n\nsubmits that the present petitions relate to a purely\n\ncontractual dispute arising out of the tender proceedings\n\nand, therefore, in view of the law laid down by the\n\nSupreme Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/899629/\" id=\"a_1\">Kisan Sahkari Chini\n\nMills and others vs. Vardan Linkers and others</a>,\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/27844805/\" id=\"a_2\">2008) 12 SCC 500, Rishi Kiran Logistics Private Ltd.\n\nvs.   Board of Trustees of Kandla Port Trust and\n\nothers</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/7338589/\" id=\"a_3\">2015) 13 SCC 233 and South Delhi Municipal\n\nCorporation vs.      Ravinder Kumar and Another</a>,\n\n(2015) 15 SCC 545, wherein the Supreme Court has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                  10            W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                     16746/2016</span>\n\ncategorically held that a writ in contractual matters is\n\nnot maintainable         and it is only the administrative\n\ndecision    taken   by    the    authorities    in   the    tender\n\nproceedings which can be          subjected to judicial review\n\nand scrutiny under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Articles 226</a> <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_5\">&amp; 227</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India, therefore, the petitions filed by the petitioners\n\nbe dismissed.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">17. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners in\n\nreply submits that in terms of Clauses 41 and 42 of the\n\nGeneral Instructions to Tenderers (GIT), a copy of which\n\nhas been filed as Annexure P/1, the award of contract in\n\nfavour of the petitioner stood concluded on issuance of\n\nthe NOA on 13.1.2016. It is submitted that once the\n\ncontract in favour of the petitioner stood concluded, the\n\nrespondent authorities could not have cancelled the NOA\n\nby issuance of a simple notice without resorting to the\n\nprocedure prescribed under Clause 24 of the General\n\nConditions of Contract, which provides for issuance of a\n\nnotice     and   following      the   proper     procedure       for\n\ntermination of the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">18.

If the dispute was considered as purely one\nrelating to existence of an agreement, that is,\nwhether there was a concluded contract and\nwhether the cancellation and consequential non-\nsupply amounted to breach of such contract, the\nfirst respondent ought to have approached the\nCivil Court for damages. On the other hand, when\na writ petition was filed in regard to the said\ncontractual dispute, the issue was whether the\nSecretary      (Sugar),     had    acted   arbitrarily    or\nunreasonably, in staying the operation of the\nallotment letter dated 26.3.2004 or subsequently\ncancelling the allotment letter. In a civil suit, the\nemphasis is on the contractual right. In a writ\npetition, the focus shifts to the exercise of power\nby the authority, that is whether the order of\ncancellation     dated    24.4.2004    passed     by     the\nSecretary (Sugar), was arbitrary or unreasonable.\nThe issue whether there was a concluded contract\nand   breach      thereof    becomes       secondary.     In\nexercising writ jurisdiction, if the High Court found\nthat the exercise of power in passing an order of\ncancellation was not arbitrary and unreasonable,\nit should normally desist from giving any finding\non disputed or complicated questions of fact as to\nwhether there was a contract, and relegate the\npetitioner to the remedy of a civil suit. Even in\ncases where the High Court finds that there is a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                   16           W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                     16746/2016</span>\n\nvalid contract, if the impugned administrative\naction by which the contract is cancelled, is not\nunreasonable or arbitrary, it should still refuse to\ninterfere with the same, leaving the aggrieved\nparty to work out his remedies in a Civil Court. In\nother words, when there is a contractual dispute\nwith a public law element, and a party chooses\nthe public law remedy by way of a writ petition\ninstead of a private law remedy of a suit, he will\nnot   get   a   full    fledged        adjudication        of   his\ncontractual rights, but only a judicial review of the\nadministrative action. The question whether there\nwas a contract and whether there was a breach\nmay, however, be examined incidentally while\nconsidering      the         reasonableness           of        the\nadministrative action. But where the question\nwhether     there      was    a    contract,   is     seriously\ndisputed, the High Court cannot assume that\nthere was a valid contract and on that basis,\nexamine the validity of the administrative action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">24.   In this case, the question that arose for\nconsideration in the writ petition was whether the\norder dated 24.4.2004 passed by the Secretary\n(Sugar), cancelling the allotment letter dated\n26.3.2004 was arbitrary and irrational or violative\nof any administrative law principles. The question\nwhether there was a concluded contract or not,\nwas only incidental to the question as to whether\ncancellation    order        dated     24.4.2004      by        the\nSecretary (Sugar), was justified. As the case\ninvolved several disputed questions in regard to\nthe existence of the contract itself, the High Court\nought to have referred the first respondent to a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                            17            W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\nCivil Court. But the High Court in exercise of its\nwrit jurisdiction, proceeded as if it was dealing\nwith a pure and simple civil suit relating to breach\nof contract.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">25.   When certain disputed facts cropped up, the\nHigh Court adopted a strange procedure of calling\nthe General Managers of Sitarganj Sugar Mills and\nNadehi Sugar Mills and putting some questions to\nthem and recording their statements. The High\nCourt reached the conclusion that there was a\nconcluded contract between the five sugar mills\nand the first respondent for sale of 85,000 quintal\nof molasses at a price of Rs. 127/- per quintal.\nThereafter,    it   formulated    the   question    for\nconsideration in the writ petition as &#x27;whether the\nState Government was competent to cancel the\nvalid and completed contract&#x27;, and held that\nhaving    regard     to   the    doctrines    of   part\nperformance, legitimate expectation, estoppel and\nacquiescence, the cancellation of the allotment\nletter dated 26.3.2004 issued by the Assistant\nCane Commissioner was unsustainable and the\nfirst respondent was entitled to lift the entire\nquantity of 85,000 quintal (less 7,465.9 quintal\nalready lifted), and he was also entitled to\nextension of time for taking delivery by one\nmonth and seven days from the date of the\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">26.   In this view of the matter, two questions\narise for our consideration.

Before a court can record a finding as to\nwhether there is a contract, it has to find out who\nare the parties to the contract, when and what\nwas the offer, whether there was an acceptance,\nand whether the offer and acceptance were valid.\nNone of these were addressed nor answered by\nthe High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">28. to 32. xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">33.

This was wholly illegal as it was not in\npursuance of any concluded contract and as first\nrespondent was not a bona fide consumer. The\nfirst respondent submitted the authorization letter\nfrom the Patiala Distillers and the Chandigarh\nDistillers only on 14.3.2004. If there was already a\nconcluded contract with the first respondent on\n3.3.2004, there could not have been any change\nin the contract by submitting an authorization\nletter     from      Patiala    Distillers    and       Chandigarh\nDistillers      on    14.3.2004.

It cannot be denied that the\n        principles of judicial review would apply\n        to the exercise of contractual powers\n        by Government bodies in order to\n        prevent arbitrariness or favouritism.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                            22                  W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                     16746/2016</span>\n\nHowever, it must be clearly stated that\nthere        are    inherent        limitations       in\nexercise       of   that    power         of    judicial\nreview. Government is the guardian of\nthe finances of the State. It is expected\nto protect the financial interest of the\nState. The right to refuse the lowest or\nany other tneder is always available to\nthe Government. But the principles <a href=\"/doc/884513/\" id=\"a_22\">laid\ndown in</a> <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\nhave to be kept in view while accepting\nor refusing a tender. There can be no\nquestion of infringement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> if\nthe government tries to get the best\nperson or the best quotation. The right\nto choose cannot be considered to be\nan arbitrary power. Of course, if the\nsaid    power        is    exercised           for   any\ncollateral purpose the exercise of that\npower will be struck down.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">        *       *     *         *     *          *\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">74.     Judicial review is concerned with\nreviewing not the merits of the decision\nin support of which the application for\njudicial review is made, bu the decision\nmaking process itself.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">        *       *     *         *     *          *\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">77.     The duty of the court is to confine\nitself to the question of legality. Its\nconcern should be:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            (1) Whether a decision making\n        authority exceeded its powers?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">            (2) committed an error of law,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                            23            W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\n       (3) committed a breach of the\n      rules of natural justice,\n       (4) reached a decision which no\n      reasonable tribunal would have\n      reached, or\n      (5) abused its powers.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">Therefore, it is not for the court to\ndetermine whether a particular policy\nor particular decision taken in the\nfulfilment of that policy is fair. It is only\nconcerned with the manner in which\nthose decisions have been taken. The\nextent of the duty to act fairly will vary\nfrom case to case. Shortly put, the\ngrounds upon which an administrative\naction is subject to control by judicial\nreview can be classified as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">      (i)    Illegality:    This    means     the\n      decision maker must understand\n      correctly the law that regulates\n      his decision making power and\n      must give effect to it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">      (ii)        Irrationally,          namely\n      Wednesbury unreasonableness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">      (iii) Procedural impropriety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">The above are only the broad grounds\nbut it does not rule out addition of\nfurther grounds in course of time. As a\nmatter of fact in R.V. Secretary of\nState for the Home Department, ex\nBrind Lord Diplock (1991) 1 AC 694,\nLord Diplock refers specifically to one\ndevelopment        namely,         the   possible\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                            24             W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                                16746/2016</span>\n\nrecognition       of       the      principle    of\nproportionality. In all these cases the\ntest to be adopted is that the court\nshould &#x27;consider whether something\nhas gone wrong of a nature and degree\nwhich requires its intervention.&#x27;\n        *     *        *        *    *     *\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">81.     Two other facets of irrationality\nmay be mentioned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">        (1) It is open to the court to\nreview the decision maker&#x27;s evaluation\nof the facts. The court will intervene\nwhere the facts taken as a whole could\nnot logically warrant the conclusion of\nthe decision maker. If the weight of\nfacts pointing to one course of action is\noverwhelming, then a decision the\nother way cannot be upheld. Thus, in\nEmma Hotels Ltd. v. Secretary of\nState for Environment, (1980) 41 P\n&amp; CR 255, the Secretary of State\nreferred to a number of factors which\nled him to the conclusion that a non\nresident&#x27;s bar in a hotel was operated\nin such a way that the bar was not an\nincident of the hotel use for planning\npurposes, but constituted a separate\nuse. The divisional court analysed the\nfactors which led the Secretary of State\nto that conclusion and, having done so,\nset it aside. Donaldson, L.J. said that he\ncould       not see on what basis               the\nSecretary of State had reached his\nconclusion.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                25               W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                      16746/2016</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">                (2) A decision would be regarded\n        as unreasonable if it is impartial and\n        unequal in its operation as between\n        different classes. On this basis in R.V.\n        Barnet London Borough Council,\n        ex. P. Johnson, (1989) 88 LGR 73\n        (DC), the condition imposed by a local\n        authority prohibiting participation by\n        those affiliated with political parties at\n        events to be held in the authority&#x27;s\n        parks was struck down.&quot; (emphasis in\n        original)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">26.   xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">27. In so far as argument of malafides is\nconcerned, apart from bald averment, there are\nno pleadings and there is not even a suggestion as\nto how the aforesaid decision was actuated with\nmalafides and on whose part. Even at the time of\narguments Mr. Vikas Singh did not even advert to\nthis aspect. In fact, the entire emphasis of Mr.\nVikas Singh was that since there was a concluded\ncontract between the parties, cancellation of such\na contract amounted to arbitrariness. As already\npointed out above that can hardly be a ground to\ntest the validity of a decision in administrative law.\nFor the sake of argument, even if you presume\nthat there a concluded contract, mere termination\nthereof     cannot     be   dubbed         as   arbitrary.    A\nconcluded contract if terminated in a bonafide\nmanner, that may amount to breach of contract\nand certain consequences may follow thereupon\nunder the law of contract. However, on the touch\nstone      of     parameters        laid    down      in     the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                 26             W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                     16746/2016</span>\n\nadministrative law to adjudge a decision as are\narbitrary or not, when such a decision is found to\nbe bonafide and not actuated with arbitrariness,\nsuch a contention in administrative law is not\nadmissible namely how and why a concluded\ncontract is terminated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">28. to 32. xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">33.   We have already indicated above that the of\nthe doctrine of fairness as well as promissory\nestoppel are in the realm of administrative law,\nwhereas the issue as to whether a concluded\ncontract was entered into between the parties and\nif so, the question of enforcement of such a\ncontract would be in the field of law of contract.\nBearing in mind this distinction becomes more\nimportant as the High Court was dealing with the\npetition filed by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">34. to 36.          xxx xxx xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">37.   The question before the Supreme Court in\nKisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd. 2008 (12) SCC\n500 were: (i) Whether the High Court was right in\nconcluding/assuming          that    there    was    a    valid\ncontract? and (ii) Whether the High Court was\njustified in quashing the order of the Secretary\n(Sugar)?

In so far as the issue regarding concluded\ncontract in the present case is concerned, this falls\nsquarely in the realm of the contract law, without\nany hue or shade of any public law. In fact, that is\nnot even pleaded or argued. At the same time,\nwhether there was a concluded contract or not is\nseriously   disputed     by      the       respondents        and,\ntherefore, in the first instance it was not even\nnecessary for the High Court to go into this issue\nand could have relegated the appellant to ordinary\ncivil remedy. We are conscious of the position that\nmerely because one of the authorities raises a\ndispute in regard to the facts, it may not be\nalways necessary to relegate the parties to a suit.\nThis was so stated in <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_28\">ABL International Ltd. &amp;\nAnr. v.

Clause 42,\n\nwhich relates to the issue of the contract, provides that\n\npromptly after the issuance of NOA and receiving the\n\ncontract agreement from the successful bidder, the\n\ntender inviting authority shall mail the contract form duly\n\ncompleted and signed in duplicate to the successful\n\nbidder   by   registered/speed      post,      whereafter      the\n\nsuccessful bidder shall return the original copy of the\n\ncontract duly signed and dated by him to the tender\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                               33         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\ninviting authority by registered/speed post.

Clause 45\n\nprovides that the name and address of the successful\n\nbidder who receives the contract would be mentioned in\n\nthe notice board / bulletin / website of the tender inviting\n\nauthority. It is also worth noting that the G.I.T makes it\n\nabsolutely clear that the contract would be for a period\n\nof one year from the date of signing the contract.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">30. From the facts of the present case, it is evident\n\nthat, after the tenders were received by the respondent\n\nauthorities, though the petitioner Godrej &amp; Boyce was\n\ninitially the lowest and L-1 bidder, however in view of the\n\nobjections filed by the rival parties, as the petitioner\n\nJanak Health Care was the only tenderer who remained\n\nin the fray, the notification of award in its favour was\n\nissued by the authorities initially on 31.12.2015 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                 34               W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                       16746/2016</span>\n\nthereafter, the revised NOA was finally issued on\n\n13.1.2016 pursuant to which the petitioner Janak Health\n\nCare   submitted     the   necessary         performance         bank\n\nguarantee on 21.1.2016 alongwith the proforma of the\n\ncontract    agreement,       however,            the      respondent\n\nauthorities instead of proceeding further immediately\n\nissued a letter to the petitioner Janak Health Care on\n\n22.1.2016 directing them to hold any type of process for\n\nthe rate contract and supply of 8 items of tender No.29\n\nby stating that the petitioner Janak Health Care was L-2\n\nas per the attached sheet.

It is also undisputed that the\n\nrespondents, in the instant case, have not forfeited the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                  35             W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                      16746/2016</span>\n\nperformance bank guarantee submitted by the petitioner\n\nJanak Health Care, nor have they taken any steps under\n\nClause 24 of the General Conditions of the Contract,\n\nterminating the contract on account of default.                Infact\n\nfacts on record brought by the parties indicate that the\n\nrespondents, pursuant to the audit objection, the CVC\n\nguidelines and the objection filed by Godrej              &amp; Boyce,\n\nfinding that the petitioner Janak Health Care remained\n\nthe single and only bidder in the contract, cancelled the\n\nNOA issued to the petitioner Janak Health Care under\n\nClause      41   of    the   agreement        and    refunded    the\n\nperformance bank guarantee as well as the Earnest\n\nMoney deposited by the petitioner Janak Health Care on\n\n3.5.2016 by Annexure R-5 to which the petitioner\n\nobjected on the ground that it was in violation of the\n\ninterim order passed by this Court in the present\n\npetition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">32. When         the    aforesaid     facts    are     taken    into\n\nconsideration in view of Clauses 38, 39, 41, 42, 43 and\n\n45 of the GIT, it is apparent that prima facie the\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care was found to be the\n\nsuccessful bidder and was issued a notification of award.\n\nHowever, subsequent steps as enumerated in Clause 42\n\nwere not taken for actually signing and entering into a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                              36         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                              16746/2016</span>\n\nregistered agreement and contract of the nature which\n\nhas been defined in Clauses 2(1)(ii) of the GIT which\n\ndefines the same to mean the written agreement\n\nentered into between the tender inviting authority and/or\n\nthe consignee and the supplier         together with all\n\ndocuments     mentioned    therein    and   including     all\n\nattachments, annexures etc. therein.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">33. It is also apparent that in the absence of any such\n\nwritten agreement and contract between the parties, the\n\nrespondents have not taken any steps under Clause 43\n\nrelating to forfeiture of the earnest money deposited or\n\nthe performance bank guarantee submitted by Janak\n\nHealth Care or for termination of the contract as per\n\nClause 24 of the General Conditions of Contract as no\n\nsuch written contract had come into existence.          The\n\nrespondents have infact cancelled the NOA issued under\n\nclause 41 of the GIT on the ground that the same was\n\nnot in public interest as there was no competitive\n\nbidding on account of the fact that the petitioner Janak\n\nHealth Care was the single and only tenderer remaining\n\nin the fray as well as in view of the audit objections, the\n\nCVC guidelines as well as the objection of the other\n\ntenderer Godrej &amp; Boyce who had infact quoted lesser\n\nrates for the same items and had initially been enlisted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                              37         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                              16746/2016</span>\n\nas L-1.   The respondents have brought on record the\n\ndecision taken by them on 3.3.2016 to that effect as\n\nAnnexure R-6.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_96\">34. On a perusal of the impugned communication\n\nissued to the petitioner on 21.4.2016, it appears that the\n\nsaid communication has been served upon the petitioner\n\nby the respondents informing it regarding cancellation of\n\nthe NOA issued in their favour and for returning the\n\nperformance bank guarantee with reference to the\n\ndecision taken by them on 3.3.2016,          though it is an\n\nadmitted fact that the decision dated 3.3.2016 taken by\n\nthe respondent authorities to cancel the single tender in\n\nfavour of petitioner Janak Health Care was never\n\ninformed or communicated to petitioner Janak Health\n\nCare. However, at the same time, it is pertinent to note\n\nthat though this decision taken by the respondents to\n\ncancel the NOA dated 3.3.2016 was placed on record by\n\nthe respondents alongwith the return before this Court,\n\nthe same has not been challenged and is not the subject\n\nmatter of dispute in the present petitions and the only\n\norder challenged by the petitioner Janak Health Care in\n\nW.P.7805/2016 is the communication dated 21.4.2016\n\ncancelling the NOA issued in their favour.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                38        W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">35. Though     the   learned    Senior   Counsel    for   the\n\npetitioners submits that the respondents in the past as\n\nwell as in tender No.30, which has been quoted by the\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care, had proceeded further in\n\nthe contract by treating the NOA issued to the petitioner\n\nas a concluded binding contract between the parties,\n\nhowever, while continuing with the contract for purchase\n\nof health care materials from the petitioner in respect of\n\ntender No.30, the respondents have subjected the\n\npetitioner to hostile discrimination only in respect of\n\ncontract No.29 by cancelling it and by treating it as an\n\nunconcluded contract.      It is submitted that such a\n\ndiscriminatory treatment had been meted out to the\n\npetitioner inspite of the fact that the provision of Clause\n\n42 of the GIT has not been followed even in tender No.30\n\nwhich has been awarded to the petitioner and, therefore,\n\nentering into a written agreement is not mandatory and\n\ncompliance of the procedure under Clause 42 is also not\n\nmandatory as reflected from the steps taken by the\n\nrespondents in respect to tender No.30, inspite of which\n\nthe petitioner has been deprived of its rights in that\n\nregard in tender no.29 wherein in similar circumstances\n\nthe respondents have not treated the contract to be a\n\nconcluded one.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                               39         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_99\">36. In response to the same, the learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the respondents has filed an affidavit\n\nbringing on record the signed agreement between the\n\nparties in respect of tender no.30 which fact is again\n\ndisputed by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner\n\nby stating that infact the said written contract in Tender\n\nNo.30 is still not concluded and finalized in terms of\n\nClause 42 of the GIT as counter signing and other\n\nnecessary   procedural   requirements     have   not    been\n\nformally undertaken by the respondent authorities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27844805\" id=\"span_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"899629\" id=\"span_93\">37. From the aforesaid rival contention of the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties it is apparent that there is serious\n\ndispute between the parties in this regard which cannot\n\nbe gone into by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, moreso in view of the decision\n\nrendered by the Supreme Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/899629/\" id=\"a_32\">Kisan\n\nSahkari Chini Mills Ltd.</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/27844805/\" id=\"a_33\">Rishi Kiran\n\nLogistics Private Ltd.</a> (supra).</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">38. On properly considering the clauses of the GIT in\n\njuxtaposition with the facts of the case, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that while the issuance of the NOA\n\nwould amount to conclusion of the proceedings for award\n\nof the contract, however, it would not bring into\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                 40           W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                                   16746/2016</span>\n\nexistence a binding and concluded contract between the\n\nparties which would come into existence only on the due\n\nand full execution of the written contract between the\n\nparties. We are constrained to say so in view of the\n\nspecific clauses of the GIT defining the word &quot;contract&quot;\n\nto mean the signed and written contract; the clause\n\nproviding that the period of contract would be one year\n\nfrom the date of signing of the written contract and\n\nclause   43    of   the   GIT        which   enumerates       the\n\nconsequences of not executing the written contract even\n\nthough the NOA has been issued. We are, therefore, of\n\nthe opinion that mere issuance of a NOA would not bring\n\ninto existence a final binding written contract between\n\nthe parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">39.

It is also apparent\n\nthat    after      issuing    the   impugned      hold    order,   the\n\nrespondents examined the matter again on 3.3.2016 and\n\nthereafter, taking into consideration the fact that though\n\ntwo persons namely; M/s Godrej &amp; Boyce Ltd. and M/s\n\nJanak Health Care were shortlisted, as responsive,\n\nhowever, subsequently on objections being filed by the\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care, M/s Godrej &amp; Boyce Ltd.\n\nwas declared as non-responsive on account of which the\n\npetitioner      Janak     Health     Care   remained      the   single\n\ntenderer in the fray as well as the fact that the audit\n\nauthorities have also taken objection in respect of the\n\naward of the tender to petitioner Janak Health Care as\n\nthere were no contesting rates and as                   the petitioner\n\nJanak Health Care was the only tenderer remaining in the\n\nfray and that the amount for which the purchases have\n\nto be made was huge and that there were no contesting\n\nor comparative rates for the Health Care equipments,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                               42         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                               16746/2016</span>\n\ntook a decision to cancel the NOA issued in favour of\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care in respect of the 9 items\n\nawarded to it for which the NOA had been issued to the\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care in tender No.29 and which\n\nhad been put on hold and also took a decision to take up\n\nfresh tender proceedings for the aforesaid items.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">40.

It is also an\n\nadmitted and undisputed fact that as no written contract\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                              44         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                              16746/2016</span>\n\nwas entered into between the parties and the name of\n\nthe petitioner Janak Health Care was not reflected by the\n\nrespondents as the successful bidder in the notice\n\nboard / bulletin / website by the Tender Inviting Authority\n\nand in such circumstances the petitioner had been\n\nclearly informed and infact directed not to take any\n\nfurther steps in the rate contract and, therefore, we are\n\nof the considered opinion that even if certain items were\n\nsupplied by the petitioner Janak Health Care to certain\n\npurchasing authorities inspite of having been directed\n\nnot to do so, that would not result in creating an\n\nirrevocable contract in their favour, specially as the NOA\n\nand the rate contract had been put up on hold by the\n\nrespondents and was ultimately cancelled by them and\n\nthat admittedly no written agreement was entered into\n\nbetween the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">43. It is noteworthy that on a query being made by this\n\nCourt on the assertion of the learned Senior Counsel for\n\nthe petitioners, the respondents have filed an affidavit\n\non 30.3.2017 before this Court alongwith documents and\n\nhave stated that they had not permitted or authorized\n\nany person to purchase health care material from\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care, however by virtue of the\n\nfact that they had been issued a NOA for Tender No.29\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                             45        W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                            16746/2016</span>\n\nsome orders were placed upon them by one of the CM &amp;\n\nHO but thereafter the respondents, on coming to know of\n\nthe same, issued strict instructions for not undertaking\n\nany purchase from the petitioner Janak Health Care and\n\ninfact also issued a show cause notice to the CM &amp; HO,\n\nDatia, vide document Annexure A-3 filed alongwith the\n\naffidavit. The respondents have also stated that before\n\nthe said clarification could be issued, health care\n\nmaterials were purchased by some CM &amp; HO from\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care for a sum of about Rs.62\n\nLakhs and that the petitioner has been paid for the\n\nhealth care materials supplied by them to the CM&amp;HO\n\nconcerned.   It is, however, stated that the aforesaid\n\npurchases were made by the CM&amp;HO under the mistaken\n\nimpression that the contract had been awarded to\n\npetitioner Janak Health Care without taking note of the\n\nfact that the NOA had been put on hold and that there\n\nwas no written agreement or contract between the\n\nparties as required by Clause 42 of the GIT, nor had the\n\npetitioner been notified as the successful bidder in the\n\nnotice board / bulletin / website of the tender inviting\n\nauthority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">44. There is yet another important reason for which we\n\nuphold the order cancelling the NOA. From a perusal of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                              46         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                              16746/2016</span>\n\nthe document, Annexure P-6, it is apparent that online\n\ntender for supply of Maternal and Child Healthcare\n\nequipments was for a period of one year from the date of\n\n&quot;signing of the contract&quot; and apparently in the instant\n\ncase there is no signed contract between the parties. It\n\nis also clear that while the NOA was issued in favour of\n\nthe petitioner Janak Healthcare on 13.1.2016 and was\n\nput on hold on 22.1.2016, therefore, as no signed\n\ncontract came into existence between the parties, the\n\nperiod of one year for which the tender was issued is\n\nnow over and, therefore, no relief in this regard can be\n\ngranted.   It is noteworthy that even from the date of\n\nissuance of the NOA one year has already elapsed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">45. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances,\n\nwhile we uphold the order passed by the respondents\n\ndated 21.4.2016, cancelling the NOA issued to petitioner\n\nJanak Health Care, however, in view of the law laid down\n\nby the Supreme Court referred to in the preceding\n\nparagraphs, we refrain from entering into the other\n\npurely contractual issues raised by the petitioners in the\n\npresent petitions leaving it to the discretion of the\n\npetitioners to take them up, if so advised, before the\n\ncompetent Civil Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                   47         W.P Nos.7805/2016 &amp;</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                   16746/2016</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">46.
