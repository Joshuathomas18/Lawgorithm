One\tSatya  Narain was one of  the  partners.  He\nsubmitted  a tender to the respondents on July 25,  1973  on\nbehalf of the firm offering to supply 1000 quintals of\tGram\nDal at the rate of Rs.185/- per bag. Tender was accepted  by\nthe  respondents.  The\tappellant committed  breach  of\t the\ncontract and as a result, the respondents filed an  applica-\ntion  under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_4\">sec. 20</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1940 before\t the\nDistrict Court for making reference for arbitration in terms\nof the contract.\n     The  application  was allowed and the dispute  was\t re-\nferred for arbitration.\n     Against  the  order  of the Addl.\tDistrict  Judge,  an\nappeal\twas filed before the High Court and the\t High  Court\nconfirmed the order of the Additional District Judge.\n     This  appeal  by special leave under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_5\">Art.\t136</a>  of\t the\nConstitution  is  against the order of the High\t Court.\t The\nappellant contended that by operation of <a href=\"/doc/1614927/\" id=\"a_6\">Sec.19(2)(a)</a> of the\nPartnership Act, 1932, there was no implied authority  given\nto one of the partners to refer the dispute relating to\t the\nbusiness  of  the  firm for arbitration\t and  therefore\t the\nreference made by the court, pursuant to a contract  entered\ninto  by one of its partner, Satya Narain on behalf  of\t the\nfirm,  was without jurisdiction and that the  original\tcon-\ntract  did  not contain arbitration clause.  In\t a  separate\nletter\twith a rubber stamp (facsimile) of the firm, one  of\nthe partners agreed for reference to arbitration and  there-\nfore the reference did not bind the other partners.\nDismissing the appeal, this Court,\n543\n    HELD: 1. The operation of Secs. 18 &amp; 19(1) is subject to\nthe   exceptions engrafted in sub-sec. (2) of <a href=\"/doc/96884/\" id=\"a_7\">Sec. 19</a>.\t<a href=\"/doc/1614927/\" id=\"a_8\">Sec.\n19(2)(a)</a> provides that in the absence of any usage or custom\nof trade to the contrary, the implied authority of a partner\ndoes  not  empower him to submit a dispute relating  to\t the\nbusiness of the firm to arbitration.

When the partner signed the tender,\nat  that time no other partners raised\tobjection  regarding\nthe  signing of the tender by the partner on behalf  of\t the\nfirm. In view of these facts it is clear that they  ratified\nthe contract. [544 E-F]\n    3. The firm had entered into a binding contract with the\ncorporation  and contract contained the\t arbitration  clause\nwhich binds the partners.\n[544 G]\n    4.\tThe contract engrafts an arbitration clause  and  in\nterms thereof the dispute is to be referred to the  arbitra-\ntion.  Therefore, the reference made by the  Addl.

The appellant  a\t partnership\nfirm consists of nine partners of which Satya Narain is\t one\nof the partners. On July 2.5, 1973 Satya Narain submitted  a\ntender\tto the respondents offering to supply 1000  quintals\nof  Gram  Dal  at the rate of Rs. 185/- per  bag.  This\t was\naccepted by the respondents by letter dated August 28,\t1973\nfollowed  by confirmation letter by the firm on\t August\t 31,\n1973.  It is the case of the respondents that the  appellant\ncommitted  breach of the contract and as a result,  the\t re-\nspondents filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1547799/\" id=\"a_12\">sec. 20</a> of the Arbitra-\ntion Act, 1940 (for short as the &#x27;Act&#x27;) before the  District\nCourt  for making reference for arbitration in terms of\t the\ncontract.  The\tAddi. District Judge after  considering\t the\nevidence  and  the objections allowed  the  application\t and\nreferred  the dispute for arbitration. Against\tthat  order,\nthe appeal was filed and the High Court confirmed the  order\nof the Addi. District Judge.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     The contention raised by Sri Sushil Kumar Jain, learned\ncounsel\t for  the  appellant is that by\t operation  of\t<a href=\"/doc/1614927/\" id=\"a_13\">Sec.\n19(2)(a)</a>  of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (for short  as\nthe  &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/107341/\" id=\"a_14\">Partnership Act</a>&#x27;) there is no implied authority  given\nto one of the partners to refer the dispute relating to\t the\nbusiness  of  the  firm for arbitration\t and  therefore\t the\nreference made by the court, pursuant to a contract  entered\ninto  by  Satya\t Narain on behalf of the  firm,\t is  without\njurisdiction.  The High Court found as a fact that  none  of\nthe  partners have entered into the witness box to deny\t the\nvalidity of the contract nor raised any objection that\tthey\nhad  not authorised Satya Narain to enter into the  contract\nnor that they were bound by any acts done by him. It is also\nfound  that Satya Narain signed the tender and at that\ttime\nno other .partners raised objection regarding the signing of\nthe tender by Satya Narain on behalf of the firm. In view of\nthese facts it is clear that they ratified the contract.  It\nis also further to be noted that. in terms of the  contract,\nthe  corporation had appropriated the security deposit\tmade\nby  the appellant-firm and that was not objected to  at\t any\ntime.  This  itself would fortify. the conclusion  that\t the\nfirm  had entered into a binding contract with the  corpora-\ntion  and  contract contained the arbitration  clause  which\nbinds the partners. The contention raised that the  contract\nis  void and that in terms of the contract, making a  refer-\nence is without jurisdiction bears no substance.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      The  High\t Court found that Satya Narain\thas  implied\npower to con duct business on behalf of the partnership firm\nand the implied authority\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">545</span>\nbinds  all  the\t partners. <a href=\"/doc/214776/\" id=\"a_15\">Sec. 18</a> of  the  Partnership\t Act\npostulates  that  &quot;subject to the provisions of\t the  Act  a\npartner\t is  the agent of the firm for the purposes  of\t the\nbusiness  of the firm&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/1084064/\" id=\"a_16\">Sec. 19(1)</a> adumbrates that  &quot;subject\nto  the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/989042/\" id=\"a_17\">Sec. 22</a> the act of the partners  which\nis  done  to carry on in the usual way the business  of\t the\nkind  carried on by the firm, binds the firm&quot;.\tThus,  Satya\nNarain has implied authority to enter into the contract with\nthe  corporation to supply the Dal of 1000 quintals  at\t the\ncontracted rate which is the usual course of the business of\nthe  appellant. But it is settled law that the operation  of\nSees.  18 &amp; 19(1) is subject to the exceptions engrafted  in\nsub-sec. (2) of <a href=\"/doc/96884/\" id=\"a_18\">Sec. 19</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1614927/\" id=\"a_19\">Sec. 19(2)(a)</a> provides that in\t the\nabsence of any usage or custom of trade to the contrary, the\nimplied\t authority  of\ta partner does not  empower  him  to\nsubmit\ta dispute relating  to the business of the  firm  to\narbitration. Satya Narain has power to do business on behalf\nof  the\t firm and in exercise thereof he  entered  into\t the\ncontract  with the corporation during the usual\t control  of\nbusiness to supply the Dal. Then crucial question is whether\na valid contract which was not repudiated as per law,  binds\nthe other partners? Our answer is yes. It is not in  dispute\nthat  the  contract engrafts an arbitration  clause  and  in\nterms thereof the dispute is to be referred to the  arbitra-\ntion.  Therefore, the reference made by the  Addi.  District\nJudge  under  <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_20\">Sec. 20</a> of the Arbitration  Act  is  perfectly\nwithin the jurisdiction and in terms of the contract. It  is\nnot  the case of the partners that the firm is not  carrying\non the business of the supply of Dal and that Satya  Narain,\nas  found by the Trial Court, was authorised to do  business\non behalf of the firm.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       Under  those circumstances, the reference is  clearly\nvalid. We do not\nfind any illegality to interfere with the order of the\tHigh\nCourt.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"961334\" id=\"span_3\">In this view, the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/961334/\" id=\"a_21\">Gopal Das v.
