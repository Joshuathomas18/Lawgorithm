The petitioner therefore, contended that respondent\n\nNo.1 was required to give a notice to the petitioner about the claims\n\nreferred to the arbitrator, Sh.S.C.Kapoor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">14.    Pursuant to the appointment of Sh.S.C.Kapoor as an arbitrator\n\nand the respondent No.1 referring his claims on 31st August, 1999, the\n\narbitrator entered upon reference only on 18th September, 1999. The\n\npetitioner alleged that he too filed his counter claims on 23rd October,\n\n1999. To the counter claims filed by the petitioner the respondent No.1\n\nSociety filed a reply on 21st November, 1999.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">15.    According to the petitioner before the arbitrator he raised the\n\nobjection in terms of clause 9.01 of the agreement that the arbitrator\n\ncould not enter upon the reference without adjudication of the dispute\n\nby an architect in terms of the said clause. The petitioner submitted\n\nthat as the disputes were not referred in the first instance to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">OMP No.46/2001                                                Page 9 of 65</span>\n architect, therefore, the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to enter upon the\n\nreference. According to the petitioner it was incumbent upon the\n\narbitrator to decide the question of jurisdiction in terms of <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 16</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996 before proceeding further with\n\nthe disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">16.    Regarding the delay in the completion of the contract awarded to\n\nthe petitioner, it is asserted that the time was not the essence of the\n\ncontract, since after the expiry of the original period, no formal\n\nextension was granted by respondent No.1. According to the petitioner\n\nthis had resulted in setting the time at large and, therefore, since\n\nrespondent no.1 had not decided the fresh date for completion, it is\n\ncontended that the time was not the essence of the contract. It is also\n\nurged that on account of allowing the time to lapse because of faults on\n\nthe part of respondent No.1 and attributable to him, respondent No.1 is\n\nnot entitled to claim liquidated damages. The petitioner also alleged that\n\nthe liquidated damages as claimed by respondent No.1 were otherwise\n\nin the nature of penal provision and thus, it could not be claimed by\n\nrespondent No.1 nor could it be granted by the Arbitrator.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">17.    The petitioner has further alleged that the arbitrator has given\n\ncontradictory findings as he has inferred that the time was not made\n\nthe essence of the contract after stipulated date of completion, however,\n\nthe arbitrator has still awarded liquidated damages in the nature of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">OMP No.46/2001                                                  Page 10 of 65</span>\n penalty against the petitioner. The petitioner contended that the\n\narbitrator held that the respondent No.1 was responsible for delay of 1\n\nyear 10 days and that the petitioner was responsible for the delay of the\n\nremaining period. The finding of the arbitrator regarding the delay is as\n\nunder:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;Considering all the above facts it is clear that the contractor M/s\n       Jyoti Sarup Mittal have delayed the project at least for twelve\n       months during the period of its contract time i.e. from 19th\n       March, 1996 to 18th March, 1998 out of which two months\n       maximum may be considered which took to finalize and confirm\n       the alternative item of Ghana Teak wood in place of champ wood\n       for door, window frames. Thus the net delay of ten months in\n       completion of the construction of Group Housing Project for\n       Abhiyan Co-operative Group Housing Society Limited, works out\n       on the part of Contractors M/s Jyoti Sarup Mittal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">18.    The petitioner has challenged the remaining delay attributed to\n\nhim by the Arbitrator, as according to him the remaining delay was also\n\non account of non fulfillment of other requirements by respondent no.1,\n\nsuch as preparation of the bill in quadripulate, as was required under\n\nthe agreement; delay in release of payment of bills which was also\n\nattributable to respondent No.1. The petitioner claimed that the delay in\n\nthe release of payments should also have been added for the purpose of\n\nconsidering the aspect of extension without levy of compensation. The\n\npetitioner asserted that the factum that the payments were delayed was\n\neven admitted by the arbitrator himself and, therefore, the time lost in\n\nreleasing of the payments which was essential for the contract, should\n\nhave been considered by the arbitrator in favour of petitioner and thus\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">OMP No.46/2001                                                  Page 11 of 65</span>\n the arbitrator has conveniently ignored a very relevant issue which is an\n\nerror apparent on the face of the record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">19.    The petitioner has also challenged the award on the ground that\n\ndelay was caused due to non award of electrical work. According to the\n\npetitioner since the delay was admitted, the same ought to have been\n\nattributed to respondent No.1 and not to the petitioner. According to the\n\npetitioner the finding of the arbitrator in this aspect is also apparently\n\nperverse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">20.    The petitioner has further challenged the award of sum of\n\nRs.4,11,840/- in favour of respondent No.1 on account of the delay in\n\nprocurement of Champ wood, on account of which petitioner had to\n\nincur extra expenditure in the use of Ghana Teakwood, against the\n\nclaim of Rs. 13, 72,800/- made by respondent No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">21.    The petitioner has also objected to the said award on the ground\n\nthat the non availability of Champ wood was pursuant to the order of\n\nthe Supreme Court, as a consequence of which Champ wood had\n\ndisappeared from the market, since felling of timber in Assam was\n\ncompletely banned. Since procurement of Champ wood also, in the facts\n\nand circumstances was not possible. Respondent No.1 had approved\n\nthe rate of Ghana Teakwood at the rate of Rs.43,700 cubic meter. After\n\nagreeing for the said rate respondent No.1 could not have disputed the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">OMP No.46/2001                                                 Page 12 of 65</span>\n same.

The petitioner has also contended that no wood could have been\n\nprocured unless the sample flat was ready in terms of clause 5.3.1 at\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">OMP No.46/2001                                                     Page 13 of 65</span>\n page 77 of the contract and the sample flat was completed in all respect\n\nonly in the first week of December, 1996 and the payment of the same\n\nwas made on 7th January, 1997.

The petitioner has also objected to the award on the ground that\n\nthe architect had not determined the issues in the present matter,\n\ntherefore, the award of the arbitrator is totally against the provisions of\n\nthe contract. According to the petitioner the liquidated damages\n\ncomputed by the arbitrator in terms of clause 8.2.2 are penal in nature\n\nand such penal provisions could not be enforced and thus the arbitrator\n\nhas misconducted himself as for awarding the liquidated damages the\n\nrespondent No.1 was liable to prove the loss suffered by respondent\n\nNo.1. Since there is no evidence about any loss suffered by respondent\n\nNo.1, the amount as awarded by the arbitrator in terms of clause 8.2.2\n\nis not sustainable and thus the award is liable to be set aside.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"158693\" id=\"span_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"584252\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1042625\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1864677\" id=\"span_17\">24.

The pleas and contentions of the petitioner have been refuted by\n\nRespondent No.1 by contending inter alia that clause 8.2.1 of the\n\ncontract stipulated that the architect shall monitor progress of the work\n\nas per the CPM Chart/bar chart. Clause 8.2.2 further enjoined that on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">OMP No.46/2001                                                     Page 17 of 65</span>\n failure on the part of the contractor to adhere to the progress, the\n\npetitioner shall be liable to pay to the respondent No.1 compensation for\n\ndelay and the amount equal to half percent of the contract value per\n\nweek subject to a maximum of 5% of the overall contract value.\n\nAccording to respondent no.1 since the petitioner refused to get the\n\ndisputes adjudicated before the Architect, the disputes were referred to\n\nthe arbitrator and the petitioner cannot object to the same. According to\n\nrespondent no.1 the arbitrator has awarded liquidated damages subject\n\nto 10% of the overall contract value of approximately Rs. 5.7 crores and\n\nthis cannot be faulted by the petitioner as has been alleged by him.\n\nAccording to the respondent no.1 there is ample evidence in respect of\n\nthe loss suffered by the respondent no.1 on account of delay in\n\ncompletion of project of construction of flats by the petitioner.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">27.    Regarding the objection of the petitioner, that the arbitrator had\n\nnot awarded the liquidated damages but the penalty, respondent No.1\n\ncontended that the arbitrator in fact has dealt only with liquidated\n\ndamages as per Clause 8.2.2 of the contract. The fact that the arbitrator\n\nhas not awarded the penalty but the liquidated damages is also\n\napparent from the methodology, the procedure and the formulae used\n\nby the arbitrator which is contemplated under Clause 8.2.2 of the\n\nagreement stipulating award of liquidated damages. The respondent\n\nno.1 asserted that though the petitioner had caused a delay of 61 weeks\n\nyet as per clause 8.2.2 the liquidated damages where limited for 20\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">OMP No.46/2001                                                      Page 18 of 65</span>\n weeks only by the arbitrator. The respondent No.1 emphasized that the\n\nuse of the word „penalty‟ at one place in the award will not change the\n\nnature of the liquidated damages awarded by the arbitrator to the\n\npetitioner, to that of penalty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">28.    The respondent No.1 also contended that the petitioner himself\n\nhas used the terms &quot;penalty&quot; and &quot;liquidated damages&quot; synonymously\n\nand, therefore since the liquidated damages were awarded in terms of\n\nClause 8.2.2 which only contemplates award of liquidated damages and\n\nnot penalty, the amount awarded by the arbitrator to the respondent\n\nno.1 will not become penalty. Reliance was also placed on behalf of\n\nrespondent no.1 on ONGC v. Saw Pipes, JT 2003(4) SC 171 to contend\n\nthat if the illegality is of a trivial nature, it cannot be held that the\n\naward is against public policy. In the circumstances it is contended that\n\nuse of the word „penalty‟ at one place will not convert the liquidated\n\ndamages awarded to the respondent No.1 to that of penalty and thus,\n\nthe award of such liquidated damages cannot be termed as unclear,\n\nunreasonable and such that will shock the conscience of the Court.\n\nRespondent No.1 also contended that a part of the delay on the part of\n\nthe contractor, petitioner has been condoned by the arbitrator though\n\nrespondent No.1 had refused to extend the performance of the contract\n\nwhich is also evidenced by letter dated 28th July, 1998 addressed to the\n\npetitioner. According to respondent No.1 even if the respondent no.1\n\nhad extended the time, still it is entitled to recover liquidated damages\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">OMP No.46/2001                                                Page 19 of 65</span>\n for delay and the arbitrator has therefore rightly awarded the liquidated\n\ndamages to the respondent No.1 in the facts and circumstances.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1848972\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"268109\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"584252\" id=\"span_26\">29.

The respondents did not cooperate with the\n                 Architects and the Claimants society in constructive\n                 manner. Instead they doubted the impartiality of the\n                 Architects stating that the Architect is a party to the\n                 disputes and under the circumstances they would not\n                 accept the appointment of Architects as arbitrator. This was\n                 a clear violation of sub clause 9.01 of the agreement.

In the\n\ncase cited by the petitioner the plea of the Lalit Kala Akademi was that\n\nthere was no agreement whatsoever executed by the Akademi with\n\nM/s.Svapan Construction and thus, clause 45 of the tender document\n\nwould not, in any way, bind Akademi and, therefore, the arbitration\n\nproceedings would not lie in view of the passing of the takeover Act by\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">OMP No.46/2001                                                      Page 22 of 65</span>\n the Central Government. Reliance was placed on provision 3(3) of the\n\nagreement entered by the earlier management of the Akademi which\n\nstood automatically terminated. M/s.Svapan Construction had not\n\nchallenged the said Act or the termination. It was held that it would not\n\nbe open to the contractor to enforce only one clause that is clause 45 of\n\nits agreement by referring to arbitration. This plea that the arbitrator\n\nhad no jurisdiction was raised at the beginning of the arbitration\n\nproceedings, as Akademi had sent a communication to the arbitrator\n\nobjecting to the jurisdiction to enter upon reference and to hold the\n\narbitral proceedings. The arbitrator, however, overlooked the basic\n\nobjection which could be said to be an objection within the meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitrator\n\nfailed to discharge the obligation in this regard and chose to proceed\n\nwith the matter without answering the objection raised about the\n\njurisdiction. In these circumstances, it was held that the arbitral\n\nTribunal ought to have considered and answered the same in the first\n\ninstance before proceeding to decide the claims of the contractor.\n\nConsequently the award of the sole arbitrator was set aside. In contra\n\ndistinction in the present case the arbitrator has decided the objection\n\nof the petitioner which has been reproduced hereinabove. The arbitrator\n\ncategorically noted that the petitioner did not cooperate with the\n\narchitects of respondent no1, the society in a constructive manner and\n\nrather they doubted the impartiality of the architect by contending that\n\nthe architect is a party to the dispute and under the circumstances the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">OMP No.46/2001                                                Page 23 of 65</span>\n petitioner would not accept the appointment of the architect as\n\narbitrator which was in clear violation of sub clause 9.01 of the\n\nagreement. There is no provision in the agreement for appointment of\n\nany other Architect other than the one which was appointed by the\n\nrespondent no.1 society for resolution of disputes. Respondent no. 1\n\nhad also written a letter dated 16th July, 1998 invoking clause 9.01 of\n\nthe contract and seeking resolution between the society and the\n\ncontractor by the architect. However, the contractor/petitioner wanted\n\nthe disputes to be referred to arbitration. Not only did the petitioner not\n\nagree to the methodology prescribed in terms of clause 9.01 for\n\nresolution of dispute, by an architect, but the contractor/petitioner\n\nhimself raised counter claims, most of which were not raised by him at\n\nany     stage    with   respondent    No.1    or   the     architect.     The\n\npetitioner/contractor had rather requested for extension of time till 31st\n\nOctober, 1998 and had pressed for appointment of a suitable arbitrator\n\nto settle their disputes which letter was specifically noted by the\n\narbitrator as exhibit C-22. In the circumstances, the case relied on by\n\nthe petitioner/contractor is apparently distinguishable.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">32.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1848972\" id=\"span_32\">In <a href=\"/doc/1848972/\" id=\"a_13\">M.K.Shah Engineers and Contractors</a> (supra) relied on by\n\nrespondent No.1 it was held that the plea of bar, if any, created by the\n\nearlier part of the arbitration clause cannot be permitted to be set up by\n\na party which itself has been responsible for frustrating the operation\n\nthereof. The Supreme Court had held that it will be a travesty of justice,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">OMP No.46/2001                                                   Page 24 of 65</span>\n if the claimant is denied the right to have recourse to the remedy of\n\narbitration on account of default of another party. In the precedent\n\nrelied on by the respondent No.1 the reference to arbitration was\n\nrequired to be preceded by a decision of the Superintending Engineer\n\nand the procedure also contemplated a challenge to such decision\n\nwithin 28 days by a party not agreeing therewith. It was held that the\n\nsteps preceding the coming into operation of the arbitration clause\n\nthough essential are capable of being waived and if one party has by its\n\nown conduct or the conduct of its officials disabled such preceding\n\nsteps being taken, it will be deemed that the procedural pre-requisites\n\nwere waived. In the present case respondent No.1 had referred its\n\ndisputes to the architect as per Clause 9.01 of the contract, even\n\nthough     the   exact     amounts   were   not   quantified.   However,     the\n\npetitioner/contractor had refused to participate in the resolution of\n\ndisputes raised before the architect on the ground that the architect\n\nhimself is a party for delay and therefore, he would not adjudicate the\n\nissues     raised        before   him   fairly    and     impartially.      The\n\npetitioner/contractor in the circumstances being at fault cannot be\n\npermitted to set up the bar of non performance of pre-requisite\n\nobligation so as to exclude the applicability and operation of the\n\narbitration clause. The petitioner/contractor rather himself without\n\nreferring the dispute to the architect referred the disputes/counter\n\nclaims to the arbitrator and in the circumstances the petitioner cannot\n\nbe allowed to contend that the disputes in the first instance ought to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">OMP No.46/2001                                                     Page 25 of 65</span>\n have been referred to the architect.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1864677\" id=\"span_35\">In M/s.Bharat <a href=\"/doc/1864677/\" id=\"a_14\">Heavy Electricals Ltd</a>\n\n(supra), another precedent relied on by the respondent No.1, the Bharat\n\nHeavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) had primarily attacked the award on the\n\nground that the arbitration proceedings initiated by Globe Hi-Fabs\n\n(GHF) were premature and against the terms of the contract as GHF\n\nhad failed to refer their claims/dispute to the engineer and obtain his\n\ndecision in terms of clause 43(i) of GCC. The Court noticed that BHEL\n\nrather had not designated, appointed or notified any of its engineers to\n\nbe the „Engineer‟ in terms of the relevant clause. If there was no\n\ndesignated, appointed or notified `engineer&#x27;, the BHEL could not insist\n\nupon the GHF to have made a reference to the `engineer&#x27; for obtaining\n\nhis final decision in the matter, before invoking arbitration. The Court\n\nrather observed that as per order dated 23rd August, 1996, the\n\nappointment of the arbitrator to decide and make the award regarding\n\nthe claims/dispute raised by the GHF was made without any\n\nreservations and the GHF was not intimated at any stage that their\n\nrequest for invoking arbitration and appointment of an arbitrator was\n\npremature as the disputes/differences sought to be referred to\n\narbitration, had not been referred to and decided by the „Engineer‟ as\n\nenvisaged by clause 43 of GCC. In the circumstances, the plea of BHEL\n\nthat the arbitration proceedings initiated by GHF were premature and\n\nagainst the terms of the contract, because GHF had failed to refer the\n\nclaim/disputes to the „Engineer‟ and obtain its decision in terms of\n\nclause 43(i) of GCC was repelled.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">OMP No.46/2001                                               Page 26 of 65</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_67\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"268109\" id=\"span_37\">33.    In the present case as well, respondent No.1/claimant had raised\n\nthe disputes before the architect in terms of Clause 9.01 of the\n\nagreement, however, the contractor/petitioner refused to accept the\n\nadjudication by the architect adjudication by the arbitration, on the\n\npremise that the architect himself is a party and therefore, will be\n\nbiased. The petitioner has himself raised counter claims before the\n\nArbitrator without referring those disputes to the Architect. If the claim\n\nof the respondent no.1 could not be decided by the Arbitrator without\n\ntheir adjudication by the Architect, the counter claims should not have\n\nbeen pressed by the Petitioner before the Arbitrator without getting\n\nthem adjudicated from the Architect. These aspects have been\n\ncategorically dealt with by the arbitrator and in the circumstances the\n\nplea of the petitioner/contractor that the arbitrator did not decide about\n\nits jurisdiction cannot be sustained. The learned counsel for the\n\nrespondent No.1 also relied on M/s. <a href=\"/doc/268109/\" id=\"a_15\">Wee Aar Construction Builders</a>\n\n(supra) by holding that where it was held that if the contractor also\n\nsubmits to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator by filing the counter claim\n\nthen the principle of waiver and acquiescence shall be applicable. In the\n\npresent case also the petitioner is deemed to have waived his objection\n\nby submitting to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator by referring a number\n\nof counter claims to the Arbitrator and his objection that the disputes\n\nought to have been decided at the first instance by the Architect cannot\n\nbe sustained in the facts and circumstances.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">OMP No.46/2001                                                 Page 27 of 65</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\"> 34.     The plea of the petitioner that the arbitrator mis-conducted in\n\nnot deciding about his jurisdiction first, before dealing with the claims\n\nof both the parties is not sustainable in the facts and circumstances\n\nand is contrary to the record. The disputes were referred by the\n\nrespondent No.1 to the architect, however, the petitioner on its own\n\ndecided that the architect is biased and refused to participate in the\n\nadjudication and resolution of the disputes which were referred to the\n\narchitect in the first instance, in compliance with Clause 9.01 of the\n\nagreement. In case the petitioner had any apprehension about the\n\narchitect being biased, the remedy with the petitioner was to take\n\nappropriate legal recourse and the petitioner could not have refused to\n\nparticipate before the architect, for the adjudication of the disputes,\n\nwhich were referred to the architect in compliance with the term of the\n\nagreement between the parties. In any case since the petitioner himself\n\nrefused to participate in the adjudication of the disputes by the\n\narchitect, the petitioner cannot invoke the bar of clause 9 for\n\nadjudication of disputes by the arbitrator. The objection of the\n\npetitioner in this regard is, therefore, not sustainable and is repelled. It\n\ncannot be held in the circumstances that the arbitrator had committed\n\nmisconduct, as has been alleged by the petitioner. In any case the\n\npetitioner himself referred the counter claim to the arbitrator without\n\nraising those claims before the architect. In the circumstances, if the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">OMP No.46/2001                                                  Page 28 of 65</span>\n arbitrator has adjudicated the claims of the petitioner and respondent\n\nNo.1, he cannot be faulted on this account.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">35.    The next plea of the petitioner/contractor is that the respondent\n\nNo.1 is not entitled for liquidated damages as the damages awarded\n\nagainst    him   are   in    the    nature    of     penalty.   According   to   the\n\npetitioner/contractor       the    entire    delay    was   attributable    to   the\n\nrespondent No.1 and not just the delay of one year and ten days as has\n\nbeen held by the arbitrator. The petitioner has contended that against\n\nthe claim of Rs. 57 lakhs the arbitrator has awarded a sum of\n\nRs.57,02,672/- while taking recourse to clause 8.2.2 of the agreement.\n\nAccording to the petitioner the said clause clearly shows that\n\ncompensation damages could be awarded by only the architect and not\n\nthe arbitrator. According to the petitioner since the amount has not\n\nbeen awarded by the architect, therefore, award of the arbitrator is in\n\ncomplete dereliction of the provisions of the contract. It is also\n\ncontended that the liquidated damages awarded by the arbitrator in\n\nterms of clause 8.2.2 is otherwise penal in nature and thus could not be\n\nenforced. It is further contended that if it is to be taken as a case of\n\nliquidated damages then the respondent No.1 was required to prove\n\nsuch loss, which was alleged to have been suffered by respondent No.1,\n\nwhich according to the petitioner has not been established. According to\n\nthe petitioner, there is no evidence for sufferance of such loss and,\n\ntherefore, no amount could be awarded to the respondent No.1 against\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">OMP No.46/2001                                                         Page 29 of 65</span>\n the petitioner. The pleas raised by the petitioner in its written synopsis\n\ndated 10th February, 2009 regarding the said claims are as under:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                 &quot;18. Claim No.2,3 and 4 - Respondent No.1 claimed\n                 compensation for the loses suffered on account of delay in\n                 completion of the project and under claim no.4 the\n                 respondent no.1 claimed liquidated damages of Rs.57 lacs\n                 due to delay. It is submitted that despite the fact that the\n                 arbitrator had agreed that 1 year 10 days delay was on the\n                 part of respondent no.1, the arbitrator has awarded a sum\n                 of Rs.57,02,672/- as against the claim amount of Rs.57\n                 lacs to respondent No.1 while taking recourse to clause\n                 8.2.2 of the contract agreement. The reference to clause\n                 8.2.2 clearly shows that compensation so provided is to be\n                 determined by the architect and not by the arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">                 19. That it is submitted that it was an admitted case that\n                 the architect in the present case has not determined any\n                 compensation, therefore, the award of the arbitrator is\n                 totally against the provisions of the contract. Even\n                 otherwise, the amount mentioned in claim no.4 is on\n                 account of liquidated damages in terms of clause 8.2.2\n                 which is otherwise penal in nature and the penal provisions\n                 are not liable to be enforced in law. Moreover, even if it is\n                 taken to be a case of liquidated damages then the\n                 respondent no.1 was bound to prove such loss having been\n                 suffered by respondent no.1 which admittedly respondent\n                 no.1 has deliberately failed to prove to have suffered. There\n                 was no evidence for sufferance of said loss, therefore there\n                 was no question of awarding any amount under this claim.\n                 The arbitrator has acted totally mechanically simply\n                 following the method adopted in clause 8.2.2 and without\n                 looking into the fact that respondent no.1 has miserably\n                 failed to prove any loss on the said amount. Moreover, since\n                 time was not set at large by respondent no.1 alone,\n                 therefore there was absolutely no reason to award any\n                 amount to the petitioner under this claim.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">36.    The arbitrator in his award has categorically noted that clause\n\n5.1 laid down that within the period of 24 months the project was\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">OMP No.46/2001                                                     Page 30 of 65</span>\n required to be completed i.e. from 19th March, 1996 to 18th March,\n\n1998. Sub clause 5.14 categorically stipulates that time is the essence\n\nof the contract within the period of completion, whereas, sub clause\n\n5.14.2 requires the contractor to apply within 7 days for extension of\n\ntime to the respondent No.1 through the architect. It further stipulates\n\nthat if the Contractor fails to get the time extension in writing within the\n\ntime contemplated from respondent no1/architect, then clause 5.14 for\n\ncompensation for delay would automatically become operative.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\">37.    This has not been disputed by the petitioner that he did not apply\n\nfor extension of time, even though the conclusion of the project was\n\ndelayed beyond 24 months up to 52 months, though the respondent\n\nNo.1 and the architect have contended that even after 52 months, the\n\nwork was incomplete. On behalf of respondent No.1 it had been\n\ncontended that as the contractor/petitioner had failed to get the time\n\nextended, he became liable to pay the compensation/liquidated\n\ndamages and the relevant clause of 5.14 of the contract became\n\noperative automatically. The respondent No.1 had also contended that\n\nthe agreement specifically provided for the continuance of the\n\nagreement, till its completion, subject to the payment of the appropriate\n\ncompensation after the expiry of 24 months from its commencement.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">OMP No.46/2001                                                  Page 31 of 65</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\"> 38.    The       arbitrator    had      also    categorically   noted    that      the\n\npetitioner/contractor never made any application seeking extension of\n\nany specific period with reference to any particular circumstance/\n\ndevelopment calling for such an extension. The arbitrator categorically\n\nreferred     to      the      program     for     completion     given     by      the\n\npetitioner/contractor by letter dated 18th December, 1997 (Exhibit C-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">112) which was revised in March, 1997 promising completion by 5th\n\nFebruary, 1998 (Exhibit C-107) and thereafter, despite repeated\n\nwarnings about very unsatisfactory pace at which the work was\n\nexecuted, the respondent No.1 had written a letter dated 14th October,\n\n1997 (Exhibit C-70). Though a fresh bar chart was given on 20th\n\nOctober, 1997 reaffirming the completion of the project by 30th March,\n\n1998 (Exhibit C 69) but the bar chart was very inadequate. It was also\n\nnoted that while the bar chart was given it had been pointed out that\n\nthe respondent No.1 could invoke clause 8.2.1 and 8.2.2 of the\n\nagreement for compensation/liquidated damages. The respondent No.1\n\nhad informed the petitioner/contractor through the architect on 7th\n\nApril, 1998 (Exhibit C-52) about his dissatisfaction and which was\n\nstated as under:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                 &quot;We must in the first place, record our dissatisfaction at\n                 this inordinate delay which has subjected us to\n                 considerable inconvenience, avoidable costs and mental\n                 tension.

The petitioner contractor had, however, attributed the delay of the\n\nconstruction project to respondent No.1 on account of delay in issue of\n\narchitectural and structural drawings; non issue of stipulated materials\n\nlike cement and steel; delay in payment of running bills; delay in\n\napproving Champ Wood substitute; delay in award of electrical works;\n\ndelay in issue of grit wash drawing and approval of samples; delay on\n\naccount of making changes in drawings and specifications in items at a\n\nvery belated stage; enlargement of scope by introducing belatedly and\n\nun-authorizedly provision of basement in Block B; delay in arranging\n\nadditional quantity of earth to be filled under floors; change in design of\n\nelectric sub-station.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">40.    The arbitrator has dealt with the pleas and contentions of the\n\npetitioner/contractor as well as the respondent No.1 and even the\n\nrepresentations made by the architects in this regard. Regarding delay\n\nin issue of architectural and structural drawings the arbitrator\n\nconcluded by noting the fact that not even a single letter or any oral\n\nrepresentation was made by the petitioner/contractor in the regular\n\nmeetings of the building committee at site, to the effect that any\n\ndrawings had not been issued or that the work at the site had been held\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">OMP No.46/2001                                                     Page 33 of 65</span>\n up for non issue of any drawing till 20th October, 1997. The arbitrator\n\nhas noted at page 86 of the award in para 9 as under:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                 &quot;9.   The following facts are noteworthy in this connection:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                 (i)     There are not one letter from them, nor was there any\n                 oral representation made by them in the regular meetings\n                 of the Building Committee at site, to the effect that any\n                 drawings had not been issued, much less to the effect that\n                 work at the site was held up for non-issue of any drawings,\n                 till the 20th October, 1997. On that day, a letter (Exhibit C-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">                 69) was addressed by the respondents to the President of\n                 the Society, enclosing a revised programme of work,\n                 promising completion to the contract by the 31st March,\n                 1998, subject to the conditions that the Running Account\n                 payments were made promptly and that &quot;pending\n                 decisions&quot; (which were not set out) were conveyed\n                 immediately. The letter has the following as its last\n                 paragraph, indicating that they had decided to add the\n                 Architects also as yet‟s another scapegoat for their delays:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                 &quot;It may not be out the way to point out designs and details\n                 of compound wall are still awaited and the work on\n                 development activities will be started after the receipt of\n                 drawings.&quot; The drawings were issued in November, 1997\n                 but the boundary wall was not completed till the end of\n                 November, 1999.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">41.    Considering the various evidence and the facts in the present\n\nmatter the arbitrator, therefore, held that there was no delay in issue of\n\ndrawings and details which rendered the preparation of program and\n\nadvance planning of the work by the petitioner ineffective. It was further\n\nheld that if the petitioner/contractor suffered financial losses due to\n\nloss of productivity and the work force employed by it is because of lack\n\nof planning by him, then it is the petitioner/contractor who has to bear\n\nthe consequences, thereof, and the respondent No.1 and his architect\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">OMP No.46/2001                                                      Page 34 of 65</span>\n are not responsible for delay in issuing the drawings if any and,\n\ntherefore, the petitioner/contractor could not claim any extra time for\n\ncompleting the work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">42.    Regarding the plea of the petitioner/contractor about delay due to\n\nnon issue of cement and steel, the arbitrator/respondent No.2 inferred\n\nthat the cement and steel were never in short supply which is inferable\n\nfrom the stock of cement and steel. Relying on the provision of the\n\nagreement also it was held that respondent No.1 could not be held\n\nresponsible for any delays even if, those materials were not available\n\nwith the factory/stockiest/supplier or on account of required transport,\n\netc. Thus the arbitrator concluded that in view of Clause 12.1.2.5\n\nrespondent No.1 is not responsible for the delay of project due to non\n\nsupply of steel and cement and, therefore, no extra time could be\n\nallowed to the petitioner/contractor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">43.    The next plea for delay in conclusion of the project on behalf of\n\nthe petitioner/contractor was about delay in payment of bills by the\n\nrespondent No.1 society. The arbitrator considered all the pleas and\n\ncontentions of both the parties and the documents produced and\n\nproved on the record and the terms of the agreement. The arbitrator\n\nultimately held that in terms of Clause 5.9.1 respondent No.1 could\n\nwithhold payment on the ground of inordinate delay in the execution of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">OMP No.46/2001                                                Page 35 of 65</span>\n the project, however, the society refrained from doing so. The arbitrator\n\nhas further inferred that the petitioner/contractor has not been able to\n\nexplain as to how a delay of few days in payment of any bill had\n\nresulted in dislocation of the execution of the project. The arbitrator\n\nnoted    in      detail   and   analyzed   the   20   bills   presented   by    the\n\npetitioner/contractor during the contractual period of 24 months up to\n\n18th March, 1998 showing that there was no complaint in respect of 11\n\ncheques issued by the society for an amount of Rs.1,00,89,854/-. The\n\ncomplaint of the petitioner/contractor was only in respect of few out of\n\n10 bills which fact was intimated in the letter D-46. The arbitrator also\n\nnoted that the petitioner/contractor‟s grievances are imaginary and\n\nthey were rather red herrings. The observation and findings of the\n\narbitrator in this regard are as under:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                 &quot;The separate bill-wise clarifications provided in the\n                 appended notes would make it clear that the Respondents‟\n                 grievances are imaginary-that they are really red herrings\n                 meant to distract attention from their failure to complete\n                 the project in 21 months as they have promised or even in\n                 24 months as the contract required. They could do only\n                 work which amounted in financial terms to 40 per cent of\n                 the contractual value during the two years ended\n                 18.3.1998.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_87\">44.     The arbitrator has noted that though the contract does not\n\nprovide for payment of any interest in case of delay in payments of bill\n\nand the question of interest liability was dropped by the petitioner\n\ncontractor in his letter to the society dated 23rd January, 1996, as the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">OMP No.46/2001                                                        Page 36 of 65</span>\n payments were not held up for any period nor it was because the\n\nrespondent No.1 had any difficulty in payment of amounts of the bills to\n\nthe petitioner. The arbitrator also inferred that substantial payment had\n\nalready been made well before the time stipulated by the petitioner/\n\ncontractor. It was further noted that if the loss of the interest, if any,\n\nthe petitioner/contractor suffered as a result of the payment of his bills\n\nbefore the expiry of 20 days by respondent No.1, the amount would far\n\nexceed the interest which the petitioner might have earned on account\n\nof early payment of many bills by the respondent no.1 to the petitioner.\n\nTaking all the facts into consideration, the arbitrator had held that\n\ndelay in making payment of running account bills, therefore, could not\n\nbe ascribed to the respondent No.1. In any case the question of\n\npayment of interest of the delayed payment has been considered by the\n\narbitrator under counter claim 2 of the petitioner. The petitioner\n\ncontractor had claimed an amount of Rs.3,46,600/- as interest at the\n\nrate of 24% per annum on delayed payment and the arbitrator has\n\nawarded an amount of Rs.90,412/- as interest which has not been\n\nchallenged by the respondent No.1. The finding of the arbitrator\n\nregarding the plea of the petitioner contractor for delayed payment is as\n\nunder:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                 &quot;I have also examined other bills where the delay has been\n                 claimed by the respondents.

The petitioner contractor also claimed delay in approving Champ\n\nWood substitute. The arbitrator has noted that the first bar chart\n\nsubmitted by the petitioner contractor indicated start of wood work in\n\nthe month of July, 1996 and completion of wood work in October, 1997\n\ni.e. within 16 months, whereas, the ban of cutting of trees in Assam\n\nwas imposed by the Supreme Court in April, 1997 as per letter dated\n\n29th April, 1997 of the petitioner/contractor. The petitioner had\n\ninformed the society/respondent no.1 about the non availability of the\n\nChamp Wood and after considering all the aspects the petitioner/\n\ncontractor was intimated to substitute Champ Wood, with Ghana\n\nTeakwood. Considering the various factors and the facts established on\n\nrecord, the arbitrator held that though the petitioner contractor has not\n\nbeen able to establish that he took timely action to procure Champ\n\nWood and construct a sample house as required by the provisions of\n\nthe contract, however, the arbitrator still took a liberal view and\n\nconcluded that the delay of four months was acceptable on behalf of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">OMP No.46/2001                                                    Page 38 of 65</span>\n petitioner, in view of the facts and circumstances of the present matter.\n\nThe findings of the arbitrator in this regard are as under:-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">                 &quot;The     Respondents      have     not     been    able     to\n                 establish/substantiate that they took timely action to\n                 procure champ wood and construct a sample house as per\n                 provision/requirements in the contract agreement or even\n                 as per the bar chart submitted by them to the claimants\n                 after the agreement was signed. It is only after the Hon‟ble\n                 Supreme Court of India issued a judgment regarding bean\n                 on felling of champ wood in Assam that they raised the\n                 issue of shortage/non-availability of champ wood in the\n                 market. I agree with the views of the claimants in this\n                 regard. The plea of the Respondents, to my mind, that they\n                 could not procure the champ wood much in advance of\n                 making the sample flat and the approval thereof by the\n                 Claimants Society and Architect, is not tenable. It indicates\n                 their reluctance to procure champ wood. They did not even\n                 respond positively when the Claimants Society organized a\n                 meeting with a supplier of champ wood. They only pointed\n                 out that substitute Ghana teak wood or other\n                 steel/Aluminum be used in frames. This naturally had\n                 extra cost implication which the Claimants Society had to\n                 examine. The respondents there raised the delay in the\n                 completion of the project due to delay/late decision of wood\n                 substitute. The total delay in the project cannot be justified\n                 on account of this reason. Even if a more liberal view is\n                 taken of the initial delay caused by the Respondents of 12\n                 months as stated by the Architect, a delay of about four\n                 months could be accepted in the completion of the project\n                 beyond the date of completion i.e 2.4.1998, due to delay in\n                 decision of substituting champ wood by Ghana teak wood\n                 after the Hon‟ble Supreme Court banned felling of champ\n                 wood in Assam.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">                       Considering     the   submission    made     by   the\n                 Respondents and Claimants, in my view and be the interest\n                 of equity and justice, a delay of four months only could be\n                 assigned to this reason.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_93\">46.

However, on account of coordination\n\nproblem between the petitioner/contractor and the electrical contractor\n\nand since four months time had already been awarded to the\n\npetitioner/contractor for wood substitution which was a parallel\n\nactivity, it was concluded that no further time could be awarded to the\n\npetitioner in this regard, justifying delay on his part.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_94\">47.    The petitioner had next claimed delay on account of the issue of\n\ngrit wash drawing and approval of samples. The arbitrator noted in\n\ndetail the facts and circumstances and submissions and counter\n\nsubmissions and held that the delay of work on account of grit wash\n\nwas the responsibility of the petitioner/contractor and that the same\n\ncould not be attributed to the respondent No.1 or the architect. It was\n\nalso categorically observed that the petitioner was responsible for the\n\ndelay in the work due to slow progress of grit wask work. Thus, no extra\n\ntime was allowed to the petitioner contractor for delay on the said\n\nground.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">48.    The next claim for the delay by the petitioner contractor was on\n\naccount of making changes in the drawings and specifications of the\n\nitems at a very belated stage.

The petitioner contractor has also attempted to justify delay on\n\naccount of arranging additional II quantity of earth contract provision.\n\nAfter detailed analysis of the facts, it was held that there was no delay\n\ndue to the delayed decision by respondent No.1. Therefore, no delay on\n\nthis ground was held to be justifiable on the part of the petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_98\">50.    The petitioner/contractor also sought justification of delay on\n\naccount of change in the design of electric sub-station. After\n\nconsidering the facts in detail, the arbitrator ultimately held that the\n\nextension of time upto 12th April, 1999 would be justifiable on behalf of\n\nthe petitioner/contractor and therefore he would not be liable for\n\nliquidated damages as had been agreed upon between the parties for\n\nthe said period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">51.    Regarding the architect‟s letter for delay, after analyzing all the\n\nfacts and circumstances in detail the arbitrator held that the\n\npetitioner/contractor had delayed the project for 10 months after\n\ndeducting 2 months from the delay of 12 months during the period of\n\n19th March, 1996 to 18th March, 1998. The arbitrator in this regard held\n\nas under:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">OMP No.46/2001                                                  Page 41 of 65</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">        &quot;     Considering all the above facts it is clear that the contractor\n       M/s Jyoti Sarup Mittal have delayed the project at least for twelve\n       months during the period of its contract time i.e. from 19th\n       March, 1996 to 18th March, 1998 out of which two months\n       maximum may be considered which took to finalize and confirm\n       the alternative item of Ghana Teak wood in place of champ wood\n       for door, window frames. Thus the net delay of ten months in\n       completion of the construction of Group Housing Project for\n       Abhiyan Co-operative Group Housing Society Limited, works out\n       on part of Contractors M/s Jyoti Sarup Mittal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">52.

This is due to provision of basement of in\n                 tower „B‟. My views are different from that of the Architect.\n                 But considering that the construction of sub-station\n                 building is a part of this contract agreement and was got\n                 executed by the Claimants Society and Architect after\n                 12.02.1999 with estimated time of completion not\n                 exceeding two months, the date of completion of the total\n                 project including construction of sub-station could not go\n                 beyond 12.04.1999.

The arbitrator, therefore, considered the counter claims of the\n\npetitioner and allowed an amount of Rs.3,59,320/- on account of\n\npurchase of cement and steel; Rs.90,412/- on account of interest on\n\ndelayed payment; Rs.6,09,508/- on account of escalation on the cost of\n\nwork executed after the stipulated date of completion that is 18th\n\nMarch, 1998; an amount of Rs.3,77,000/- on account of carrying out\n\nitem of grit wash in completed geometrical patterns and Rs.1,08,700/-\n\nas the amount spent for insurance cover/policy beyond stipulated date\n\nof completion and finally Rs.3,95,000/- as damages, i.e a total amount\n\nof Rs. 19,39,940.

Liquidated damages must be the result of a\n\ngenuine pre-estimate of damages and they do not include a sum fixed in\n\nterrorem. In the said case, there was no evidence at all that any\n\ndamages had been caused, as the Calcutta Company had made certain\n\nsupplies and it had demanded for specifying the space for stacking. The\n\ncorrespondence had shown that the departmental officer had taken\n\nsteps to demarcate the site. According to the Calcutta Company, the\n\nmaterial could not be supplied because of lack of stacking, however, the\n\nState of Orissa forfeited the security furnished by the Calcutta\n\nCompany and penalty was also levied against the Company on account\n\nof plea of breach of contract.

The case was defended by the State of Orissa and\n\nother defendants contending that penalty and forfeiture were in\n\naccordance with the terms of the contract and they also established\n\ntheir obligation to provide the road. The trial court decreed the suit\n\nwhich was challenged in appeal. The appeal was dismissed by a Single\n\nJudge against which a Letters Patent Appeal was filed. It was contended\n\nthat the contract contemplated liquidated damages to the tune of\n\nRs.96,405/- and that the amount forfeited was not really a penalty. The\n\nquestion for determination before the Court was whether demand for\n\nRs.96,405/- was for liquidated damages under Clause 2 of the Contract\n\nor penalty under the provisions thereof. The Division Bench had held\n\nthat the Calcutta Company had made certain supplies and had\n\ndemanded space for stacking which the defendants had failed to provide\n\nto demarcate and in the circumstances it could not be held that the\n\nCalcutta Company had committed any breach of the Contract, and\n\ntherefore, the appeal was dismissed and the decree passed by the Single\n\nJudge was upheld.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">58.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1042625\" id=\"span_61\">In <a href=\"/doc/1042625/\" id=\"a_19\">Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Bank Ltd</a> (supra), relied on by the\n\npetitioner the Court had held that it is not in a position to assess the\n\ncompensation in the event of a breach of contract, the sum named by\n\nthe parties, if it be regarded as a genuine pre-estimate may be taken\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">OMP No.46/2001                                               Page 48 of 65</span>\n into consideration as the measure of reasonable compensation, but not\n\nif the sum named is in the nature of penalty.

The Court held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                 &quot;10. <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 74</a> of the Indian Contract Act deals with the\n                 measure of damages in two classes of cases (i) where the\n                 contract names a sum to be paid in case of breach and (ii)\n                 where the contract contains any other stipulation by way of\n                 penalty. We are in the present case not concerned to decide\n                 whether a contract containing a covenant of forfeiture of\n                 deposit for due performance of a contract falls within the\n                 first class. The measure of damages in the case of breach of\n                 a stipulation by way of penalty is by <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 74</a> reasonable\n                 compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In\n                 assessing damages the Court has, subject to the limit of the\n                 penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such compensation\n                 as it deems reasonable having regard to all the\n                 circumstances of the case. Jurisdiction of the Court to\n                 award compensation in case of breach of contract is\n                 unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but\n                 compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon\n                 the Court duty to award compensation according to settled\n                 principles. The Section undoubtedly says that the aggrieved\n                 party is entitled to receive compensation from the party who\n                 has broken the contract, whether or not actual damage or\n                 loss is proved to have been caused by the breach. Thereby it\n                 merely dispenses with proof of &quot;actual loss or damage&quot;; it\n                 does not justify the award of compensation when in\n                 consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has\n                 resulted, because compensation for breach of contract can\n                 be awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally\n                 arose in the usual course of things, or which the parties\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">OMP No.46/2001                                                    Page 55 of 65</span>\n                  knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result\n                 from the breach.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                 xxxxx    xxxxx     xxxxx     xxxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                 15. <a href=\"/doc/1941714/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 74</a> declares the law as to liability upon breach\n                 of contract where compensation is by agreement of the\n                 parties pre-determined, or where there is a stipulation by\n                 way of penalty. But the application of the enactment is not\n                 restricted to cases where the aggrieved party claims relief as\n                 a plaintiff. The Section does not confer a special benefit\n                 upon any party; it merely declares the law that\n                 notwithstanding any term in the contract predetermining\n                 damages or providing for forfeiture of any property by way\n                 of penalty, the court will award to the party aggrieved only\n                 reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount named\n                 or penalty stipulated. The jurisdiction of the court is not\n                 determined by the accidental circumstance of the party in\n                 default being a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit. Use of the\n                 expression &quot;to receive from the party who has broken the\n                 contract&quot; does not predicate that the jurisdiction of the\n                 court to adjust amounts which have been paid by the party\n                 in default cannot be exercised in dealing with the claim of\n                 the party complaining of breach of contract. The court has\n                 to adjudge in every case reasonable compensation to which\n                 the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant on breach of the\n                 contract. Such compensation has to be ascertained having\n                 regard to the conditions existing on the date of the breach.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">65.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"919241\" id=\"span_75\">In <a href=\"/doc/919241/\" id=\"a_35\">Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v.

The pre-estimate of damage is based on the funds locked\n\nup of the members in the incomplete housing project without yielding\n\nany income or other benefits; compulsion of some of them to pay rent\n\nfor their residential accommodation at rates which are spiraling from\n\nyear to year without occupying the apartment under construction; to\n\nget any rent income from their apartments under construction by\n\nletting them out to tenants; principal borrowed for investment in the\n\nproject as well as interest at high rates paid to the respective employers\n\nby the members of banks or LIC or Housing Finance institution like\n\nDelhi Co-operative Housing Finance Corporation Ltd or Housing\n\nDevelopment Finance Corporation.

Jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of breach\n\nof contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but\n\ncompensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon the Court\n\nduty to award compensation according to settled principles. Aggrieved\n\nparty is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken\n\nthe contract, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have\n\nbeen caused by the breach. Pre-estimate of damages merely dispenses\n\nwith proof of &quot;actual loss or damage&quot;; it does not justify the award of\n\ncompensation when in consequence of the breach no legal injury at all\n\nhas resulted, because compensation for breach of contract can be\n\nawarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the\n\nusual course of things, or which the parties knew when they made the\n\ncontract, to be likely to result from the breach. In the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the respondent no.1 society it cannot be held that no\n\nlegal injury at all has resulted or the loss caused to the respondent no.1\n\nsociety is not to be compensated.

Rallia Ram</a>, AIR 1963 SC 1685 will also be\n\nrelevant which have not been varied and still hold the field, despite the\n\npassage of many years, and numerous subsequent judgments on the\n\nsubject.</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                 &quot;14. ..........An award being a decision of an arbitrator\n                 whether a lawyer or a layman chosen by the parties, and\n                 entrusted with power to decide a dispute submitted to him\n                 is ordinarily not liable to be challenged on the ground that\n                 it is erroneous. In order to make arbitration effective and\n                 the awards enforceable, machinery is devised for lending\n                 the assistance of the ordinary Courts. The Court is also\n                 entrusted with power to modify or correct the award on the\n                 ground of imperfect form or clerical errors, or decision on\n                 questions not referred, which are severable from those\n                 referred. The Court has also power to remit the award when\n                 it has left some matters referred undetermined, or when the\n                 award is indefinite, or where the objection to the legality of\n                 the award is apparent on the face of the award. The Court\n                 may also set aside an award on the ground of corruption or\n                 misconduct of the arbitrator, or that a party has been guilty\n                 of fraudulent concealment or willful deception. But the\n                 Court cannot interfere with the award if otherwise proper\n                 on the ground that the decision appears to it to be\n                 erroneous. The award of the arbitrator is ordinarily final\n                 and conclusive, unless a contrary intention is disclosed by\n                 the agreement. The award is the decision of a domestic\n                 tribunal chosen by the parties, and the Civil Courts which\n                 are entrusted with the power to facilitate arbitration and to\n                 effectuate the awards, cannot exercise appellate powers\n                 over the decision. Wrong or right the decision is binding if it\n                 be reached fairly after giving adequate opportunity to the\n                 parties to place their grievances in the manner provided by\n                 the arbitration agreement. But it is now firmly established\n                 that an award is bad on the ground of error of law on the\n                 face of it, when in the award itself or in a document\n                 actually incorporated in it, there is found some legal\n                 proposition which is the basis of the award and which is\n                 erroneous.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">OMP No.46/2001                                                      Page 59 of 65</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1072675\" id=\"span_81\">68.

It must be taken I think that in fixing the\n                 amount that he has, he has acted on his own knowledge\n                 and experience. The day has long gone by when the Courts\n                 looked with jealousy on the jurisdiction of the Arbitrators.\n                 The modern tendency is in my opinion more especially in\n                 commercial arbitrations, to endeavor to uphold awards of\n                 the skilled persons that the parties themselves have\n                 selected to decide the questions at issue between them. If\n                 an arbitrator has acted within the terms of his submission\n                 and has not violated any rules of what is so often called\n                 natural justice the Courts should be slow indeed to set\n                 aside his award.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">       That this well settled proposition of law was reiterated in the\n\ndecision of the Apex Court in Coimbatore District Podu Thozillar\n\nSangam v.

It was observed as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                 &quot;28. We, are, therefore, of the opinion that the view taken\n                 by the Umpire on <a href=\"/doc/1054154/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 49</a> was a possible view in the\n                 light of the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium&#x27;s\n                 case. In the premises, a question of law arose certainly\n                 during the course of the proceedings. Such a question has\n                 been decided by the Umpire on a view which is a possible\n                 one to take. Even if there was no specific reference of a\n                 question of law referred to the Umpire, there was a question\n                 of law involved. Even on the assumption that such a view is\n                 not right, the award is not amenable to interference or\n                 correction by the courts of law as there is no proposition of\n                 law which could be said to be the basis of the award of the\n                 Umpire, and which is erroneous.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">71.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98502\" id=\"span_92\">In <a href=\"/doc/98502/\" id=\"a_53\">Hind Builders v.

On perusal of the judgments of the Apex Court spanning several\n\ndecades, what emerges is that jural interventions with Awards is\n\nproscribed, rather than prescribed.

The arbitrator\n\nhas considered the facts and evidence in respect of considerable\n\ninconvenience, tension and expenditure as a result of avoidable delay in\n\ncompletion of the contract work beyond the end of March, 1988, the\n\ntime agreed by the petitioner for completion of Construction of Group\n\nhousing flats. The facts and evidence regarding the funds locked up of\n\nthe members in the incomplete housing project without yielding any\n\nincome or other benefits; compulsion of some of them to pay rent for\n\ntheir residential accommodation at rates which had spiraled as they\n\nwere not able to occupy the apartment under construction; they did not\n\nget any rent income from their apartments under construction by\n\nletting them out to tenants; principal borrowed for investment in the\n\nproject as well as interest at high rates paid to the respective employers\n\nby the members of banks or LIC or Housing Finance institution like\n\nDelhi Co-operative Housing Finance Corporation Ltd or Housing\n\nDevelopment Finance Corporation.
