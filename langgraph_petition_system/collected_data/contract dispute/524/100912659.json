On the merits of the writ petition, without prejudice to the\n\npreliminary objections raised by him, Mr. R.K.Agarwal, Sr. Advocate\n\nalso urged that the liability to pay the Service Tax is admittedly on\n\nthe service provider i.e. The contractors under <a href=\"/doc/51968165/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 68(1)</a> of the\n\nAct and under <a href=\"/doc/51968165/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 68(2)</a> of the Act in case of individual\n\ncontractors except body corporates, who are liable to regular audit\n\nand compliance with the various provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_10\">Companies Act</a>\n\nand other relevant statutes, such liability to pay 50% of the Service\n\nTax has been shifted to the respondent Nigam and other body\n\ncorporates, who are awarders of such contracts and with this change\n\nin law, in the absence of any terms in the contract itself, the\n\nrespondent Nigam is perfectly justified in deducting 50% of the\n\nService Tax at source while making payment of the bills to the\n\ncontractors &amp; depositing the same in public exchequer and no\n\nchallenge can be made to the same.

At the outset, this Court is of the opinion that the present writ\n\npetition filed by the petitioner Association is not maintainable and is\n\nnot even properly constituted so as to be entertained in the extra\n\nordinary jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n\nif India. There are more than a couple of reasons for saying so.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">13.       Not only several disputed questions of facts are involved in the\n\npresent writ petition, since contracts for each contractor, members of\n\nthe petitioner Association, whose details are not even produced with\n\nthe writ petition, is a matter of terms and conditions of the contract in\n\neach case and whether the liability to pay the Service Tax as per the\n\nterms of contract is on the contractor or on the awarder of the\n                                 Contractor Association (Civil) vs. Raj.

Therefore, the locus standi to file the writ petition by the\n\npetitioner Association in such matter of levy of tax and sharing of\n\nliability to pay or bear such liability of Service Tax depending upon\n\nthe interpretation of statute, which have to be necessarily read in the\n\nlight of contractual terms as to who will bear the liability, whether it is\n\nreimbursable by the awarder of the contract or not, whether it is\n\nincluded in the gross value of Bill or is separately charged in Bills\n\netc., are the questions which can be adjudicated in the individual\n\nassessment to be undertaken by the competent Assessing Authority\n\nof the Central Excise Department, who implement the provisions of\n\nlevy of Service Tax, initially introduced by <a href=\"/doc/155925955/\" id=\"a_21\">Finance Act, 1994</a> and as\n\namended from time to time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">14.   Learned counsel for the respondent, Mr. R.K.Agarwal also\n\nrightly pointed out that in view of arbitration clause available in the\n\ncontract, in case of a dispute between the parties to the contract as\n\nto who will bear the liability of paying Service Tax and to what extent,\n\nsuch a dispute, first deserves to be raised before the arbitrator under\n\nthe said contract or in the alternative before the Assessing Authority\n\nunder the Act and such questions without any material on record in\n\nthis regard, merely by some illustrative examples of bills of one of the\n\ncontractors on a piece of paper, a photocopy of one of the Bills of\n\none such contractor, like the one produced by the petitioner\n                               Contractor Association (Civil) vs. Raj.

The sheet anchor and foundation of the case in hand of the\n\npetitioner Association that under Clause 36C of the General\n\nConditions of contract, the petitioner Association cannot be asked to\n\npay the Service Tax is absolutely misconceived. The said Clause\n\n36C apparently stipulates that the Royalty and other taxes payable to\n\nthe Government under the rules in force will be paid by the\n\ncontractor himself. The other document relied upon by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner, namely; the so called decision taken by the\n\nCommittee vide Annex.2 dated 10/11/2005 that Service Tax would\n\nbe reimbursed to the contractors by the Nigam is also a\n\nmisconceived contention for two reasons. Firstly, the heading of the\n\nminutes of the said Committee shows that it was &quot;for consideration of\n\nWTD&#x27;S (full form not even known to either of the counsels) regarding\n\napplicability of Service Tax on labour contracts for construction\n\nof transmission lines&quot;. Admittedly, the contracts in question are\n\ncivil contracts for buildings etc. for respondent Nigam and not the\n\nlabour contracts for construction of transmission lines, therefore,\n\nsuch Resolutions are not even applicable to the contractor members\n\nof the petitioner Association. Secondly, the Resolution dated\n\n10/11/2005, whereas Service Tax for works contracts became\n\napplicable w.e.f. 1/7/2007 relied upon by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, Mr. Dinesh Mehta, which is extracted below, further\n\nclarifies that the same are not applicable to the members of the\n                               Contractor Association (Civil) vs. Raj. RRVPNL &amp; Ors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                                                                Judgment dt: 1/3/2013\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 13/20</span>\n\npetitioner Association at all but was only for the Service Tax relating\n\nto particular tenders in question No. TN-3558 and TN-3546.\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             &quot;The committee discussed the case.

The said Resolution is hedged with the\n\ncondition of proof of deposit of the same in Govt. Treasury, but no\n\nsuch proof has been placed on record by the petitioner Association.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">                                Contractor Association (Civil) vs. Raj.

The Notification No.30/12 dated 20/6/2012 (Annex.5 on\n\nrecord) vide its Clause 1(v) further provides that the taxable service\n\nprovided or agreed to be provided in execution of works contract by\n\nany individual, Hindu Undivided Family or Partnership Firm, whether\n\nregistered or not, including Association of Persons, located in the\n\ntaxable territory to a business entity registered as body corporate,\n\nlocated in the taxable territory will only be covered by said\n\nNotification. Therefore, if a limited company is a service provider, the\n\nsaid Notification will not apply and on the other hand, if the awarder\n\nof the contract is not a body corporate, again the said Notification will\n\nnot apply. In the present case, one does not know, whether all the\n\nmembers of the petitioner Association are individual contractors,\n\nHUF or Partnership firm or are body corporates. In the absence of\n\nsaid material on record, the very foundation of applicability of the\n\nsaid Notification falls on the ground and cannot be decided in the\n\npresent case. The entire dispute raised by the petitioner Association\n\nthat the liability to pay Service Tax to the extent of 50% has been\n\nfixed on the service receiver, namely the Nigam, therefore, the\n\nrespondent Nigam should bear the 50% of the tax liability on its own\n\nand cannot deduct the same from the bills of the contractors\n\ndepends upon the terms of contract itself, but since no material has\n\nbeen placed on record in this regard, therefore, this Court cannot be\n\nexpected to decide such academic and hypothetical questions, which\n\nessentially depend upon the intricate terms of the contract. The\n\ninterpretation of statutes would be a hollow exercise, unless any\n\nsuch adjudication at the hands of Department has taken place.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                                Contractor Association (Civil) vs. Raj.

Prima facie, since <a href=\"/doc/51968165/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 68 (1)</a> of the Act affixed the liability\n\nto pay the Service Tax on a person providing the taxable service, the\n\nliability to pay such tax would be on the contractors and the\n\nNotification No. 30/12 dated 20/6/2012 dividing the liability to pay\n\nsuch Service Tax to the extent of 50% by both service providers and\n\nservice receivers, which is issued under <a href=\"/doc/51968165/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 68(2)</a> of the Act,\n\nquoted above, will not absolutely absolve the petitioner contractors\n\nfrom their liability to bear the entire service tax liability. Learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner himself conceded that the contractors have\n\nbeen raising their Bills inclusive of Service Tax without separately\n\ncharging the same or showing them separately in the Bills. Why it is\n\nbeing so done is anybody&#x27;s guess. <a href=\"/doc/61667332/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 67(2)</a> of the Act provides\n\nfor such inclusion of tax in the gross amount. If they are including full\n\nService Tax in their Bills, the respondent Nigam would be justified in\n\ndeducting 50% of full Service Tax liability @ 12% &amp; paying the same\n\nin State Treasury and if Service tax was being separately charged &amp;\n\nbeing reimbursed, for which there is not even a shred of evidence on\n\nrecord, and, therefore, it is only assumptive, then the question of\n\ndeduction would not have arisen, as the contractors after 1/7/2012\n\nwould have charged only 50% of the Service Tax liability of 12% &amp;\n\nclaimed its reimbursement. The said provision vide Notification no.\n\n30/12 has been introduced with an object to prevent the pilferage of\n\nService Tax collected by the contractors and reimbursed to them by\n\nthe awarders of the contract, which ultimately did not reach the\n\npublic exchequer. Therefore, to ensure the flow of tax revenue to the\n\nextent of 50% from the side of awarders of the contract, like the\n\nrespondent Nigam and other body corporates, such a provision\n                               Contractor Association (Civil) vs. Raj. RRVPNL &amp; Ors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                                                                Judgment dt: 1/3/2013\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                 16/20</span>\n\nappears to have been introduced &amp; then to realize the payment of\n\nremaining 50% of Service Tax from the contractors trekking them\n\nthrough such details provided by Nigam, who could otherwise simply\n\nescape the tax net in the absence of even prior registration and\n\nreturns filed by such individual contractors. This provision appears to\n\nbe there to plug the loopholes and check the pilferages of public\n\nrevenue &amp; the same cannot be faulted and questioned, much less by\n\nthe petitioner Association, whose locus to file the writ petition is in\n\nserious doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">18.   The   contention   of   learned      counsel       for    the     petitioner\n\nAssociation, Mr. Dinesh Mehta, based on Chief Controller of\n\nAccounts letter Annex.8 dated 6/7/2012 is also equally devoid of\n\nmerit. The same is merely an intra-departmental communication\n\nasking the authorities to comply with the provisions of law in view of\n\nchange in legal position w.e.f. 20/6/2012 upon which RRVPNL\n\nobtained legal opinion from its tax consultant &amp; circulated it to these\n\nauthorities for needful compliance. The said communication nowhere\n\nasks these authorities to deduct 50% of Sevice Tax from the Bills fo\n\nthe contracts. The said communication cannot furnish any cause of\n\naction to the petitioner contractors, much less to the Association of\n\ncontractors. This contention of petitioner shows confusion of it worse\n\nconfounded.

As long as a person/firm remains\n       in the profession, he/it has to pay professional tax. A\n       chartered accountant or a cost accountant obtains a\n       licence or a privilege from the competent body to\n       practise. The State is competent to levy a tax under\n       Entry 60 on that privilege as such. That tax has\n       nothing to do with the commercial activities which he\n       undertakes for his client.
