The    Arbitrator     had   dismissed   the    claim   of\n\nrespondent no.1 made in connection with a contract\n\nrelating to construction of a godown and ancillary\n\nbuildings etc., at the Central Warehouse, Whitefield,\n\nBangalore, as not maintainable on the ground that\n\nrespondent no.1 did not invoke the arbitration clause\n\n(clause 25 of the Contract) within 90 days from the\n\ndate stipulated therein and as there was no extension\n\nof time under <a href=\"/doc/759740/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 43(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act by\n\nthe jurisdictional court, respondent no.1&#x27;s claim was\n\ndeemed to have been waived and barred as per\n\nClause     25   of   the    Contract.   Being      aggrieved,\n\nrespondent no.1 preferred an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 37</a>\n\nof the Arbitration Act.      The Appellate Court, by the\n\njudgment impugned herein, has held that the clause in\n\nthe Contract seeking to extinguish the right of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                           -4-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       C.R.P.No.240/2011</span>\n\n\nrespondent no.1 on expiry of the specified period is\n\nvoid as contrary to <a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 28(b)</a> of the Contract Act,\n\n1872. It also held that this was a fit case wherein it\n\ncould extend the time to submit the dispute to\n\narbitration in exercise of the power under <a href=\"/doc/759740/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\n\n43(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act on the ground of undue\n\nhardship.   Accordingly, it has set aside the order of\n\nthe sole Arbitrator and has remitted the matter to the\n\nArbitrator to consider the matter on merits.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">3.

He submitted that the impugned judgment\n\nof the Appellate Court is contrary to the law laid down\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in H.P.State Forest\n\nCompany Ltd. and sought to justify the order of the\n\nArbitrator.   He also submitted that no extension of\n\ntime under <a href=\"/doc/759740/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 43(3)</a> of the Arbitration Act is\n\npermissible unless the application for extension of\n\ntime was filed in Court before commencement of\n\narbitral proceedings. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"844125\" id=\"span_7\">In support of his submission, he\n\nreferred to a judgment of the Madras High Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/844125/\" id=\"a_9\">E.Muralidharan v.

The only question that requires to be determined\n\nin this revision petition is as to whether Clause 25\n\nof the Contract is void as being contrary to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/616001/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 28(b)</a> of the Contract Act, 1872?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">     It is relevant to state that Clause 25 of the\n\nContract provides for extinguishment of the right to\n\nclaim, if no demand for arbitration relating to the\n\nclaim is made within 90 days from the date referred to\n\ntherein.

It was, thus, held that\n\ncurtailment of     the   period of        limitation   was   not\n\npermissible in view of <a href=\"/doc/597719/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 28</a> but extinction of the\n\nright itself, unless exercised within the specified time,\n\nwas permissible and can be enforced.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">7.
