Accordingly, the Petitioner entered into an\n\n                agreement dated 19.08.2009 with the 1st Respondent for Engineering supply,\n\n                erection, commissioning, test run, trial run and performance test and maintenance\n\n                of the Bio-gas fuel based Gen sets.

It is not disputed that the agreement was amended on 21.09.2009 and\n\n                29.12.2009. Thereafter Tripartite Agreement dated 17.01.2010 was entered into\n\n                between the parties, where the 2nd Respondent was become a party in the\n\n                Agreement.

It appears that 4 Gen sets were\n\n                supplied after receipt of money. However, the petitioner raised some dispute to the\n\n                quality of the Gen sets and spare parts instead of invoking the provision in the\n\n                contract to refer the dispute to the Arbitration. It appears that a criminal complaint\n\n                was lodged against the Respondent on 4.10.2010 for the offence of cheating and\n\n                fraud etc.,        Subsequently, Crl.O.P.No.27542 of 2010 was filed for a direction to\n\n                register a criminal case. The above O.P. was disposed by this Court vide order\n\n                dated 14.12.2010. Pursuant to the above orders FIR in Cr.No.209 of 2010 was\n\n                registered against the Respondent under Section 420 r/w 34 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">I.P.C</a>. On\n\n                29.12.2010.         Thereafter it appears second Respondent invoked Arbitration by\n\n                sending a notice dated 9.9.2012, which was objected by the Petitioner herein.\n\n                Now the Petitioner has filed this Application for Appointment of Arbitrator mainly\n\n                on the ground that since the parties are governed by the Contract, the dispute has\n\n                to be referred to the Arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">                          5.

In the\n\n                meanwhile the Respondent also filed Crl.O.P.No.17261 of 2012 for quashing the\n\n                criminal proceedings.     This Court has dismissed the above Crl.O.P.           In the\n\n                meanwhile, 2nd Respondent filed a suit in C.S.No.58 of 2014 before the Senior\n\n                Civil Judge, Goa, where the present Petitioner has filed <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 8</a> Application,\n\n                which appears to be pending. The present O.P. has been filed on 18.07.2014\n\n                mainly on the ground that the parties are governed by the Contract since there is a\n\n                clause for Arbitration agreed upon by the parties, matter has to be referred to the\n\n                Arbitrator. It is the main contention of the Petitioner that the Respondent during\n\n                the bail application and quash petition all along took a stand that the matter has to\n\n                be referred to the Arbitrator and the Respondent also filed an application for\n\n                appointment of arbitrator in Diary No.1460. Therefore, the cause of action is well\n\n                alive, the Petitioner is entitled to file O.P. as the contract governing the parties to\n\n                refer the matter to the Arbitration. Hence it is his contention that an Arbitrator has\n\n                to be appointed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                Page 6 / 28</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                                     O.P.No.454 of 2014</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                          6. Though elaborate Counter has been filed, the main objection of the 1st\n\n                Respondent is that as per the Tripartite Agreement they have been discharged and\n\n                further the Application for appointment of Arbitrator is barred by limitation. The\n\n                claim is also hopelessly barred and no notice of invocation was also issued.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          7. Mr.V.P. Senkkottuvel, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner\n\n                submitted that Arbitration clause is not disputed. Thought the dispute arose in the\n\n                year 2010 in respect of the supply Gen sets, police complaint has been lodged for\n\n                criminal offence committed by the Respondent. Therefore, merely because the\n\n                police complaint lodged, it cannot be said that the claim is hopelessly barred.\n\n                Even when the application for Anticipatory Bail and application filed before the\n\n                Court for quashing the criminal proceedings, the categorical stand of the\n\n                Respondent that they were governed by the contract, the matter has been referred\n\n                to the Arbitration. Having taken such stand, now it cannot be contended that the\n\n                claim is hopelessly barred. It is his contention that the 2 nd Respondent themselves\n\n                issued notice for invoking Arbitration on 09.09.2012. Hence, this Petition has\n\n                been filed within a period of three years. Therefore, same is well within the period\n\n                of limitation. Hence submitted that the issue of the limitation is mixed question of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                Page 7 / 28</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                                        O.P.No.454 of 2014</span>\n\n                law and facts and the same cannot be barred at this stage. What has to be seen is\n\n                only the existence of Arbitration Agreement. When the Respondent themselves\n\n                admitted the existence of Agreement and took a stand that the matter is referable\n\n                to the Arbitration, now they cannot object the appointment of Arbitrator.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                          8.

Jothi, learned counsels appearing for the\n\n                Respondents 1 and 2 respectively, submitted that this Petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n\n                11(6)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act is not maintainable. The procedure\n\n                agreed upon between the parties has not been followed. Mere correspondence and\n\n                exchange of notices will not extend the period of limitation. In this Petition,\n\n                consumer complaint filed in the year 2012 is suppressed. Besides, when the notice\n\n                of invocation sent by the 2nd Respondent for Arbitration, the application was\n\n                rejected for reference outrightly. Therefore, now without invoking the Arbitration\n\n                clause without issuing notice, he cannot seek for appointment of Arbitrator under\n\n                <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the Act. Hence prayed for dismissal of the Petition.

This Petition has chequered history. A.No.1828 of 2015 was taken out\n\n                by the 2nd Respondent seeking to defer the further hearings of the proceedings in\n\n                this O.P.No.454 of 2014 on the ground that since Application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8</a> of\n\n                the Arbitration and Conciliation Ac has already preferred in the suit filed by the\n\n                2nd Respondent before the Civil Court, Goa. The above application was ordered\n\n                by the then Chief Justice on 10.04.2015. Despite such order now both sides have\n\n                made an endorsement that this Court can dispose the main O.P. itself on merits.\n\n                They made an endorsement in this regard. Order has been passed by this Court in\n\n                the above application on the premise that <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8</a> Arbitration and Conciliation\n\n                Act application before Civil Court would be disposed of. However, some or other,\n\n                the matter has been prolonged till date and no order has been passed. Both sides\n\n                one or other protracting the matter. Accordingly, both sides appeared before this\n\n                Court have agreed the dispose of the matter on merits. Hence, this Court despite\n\n                the order of deferment passed by the Court earlier, decided to dispose of the matter\n\n                taking note of the delay in this matter pending from 2014.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                Page 12 / 28</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                                                                     O.P.No.454 of 2014</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">                          11. The Petitioner and the 1st Responded entered into an agreement dated\n\n                19.08.2009 for the purchase of 8 Gen sets. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 14</a> of the agreement defines the\n\n                Arbitration Clause. A Tripartite Agreement entered on 17.01.2010 makes that all\n\n                the contract has been transferred in favour of the 2nd Respondent, in fact, 1st\n\n                Respondent stands discharged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">                          12. Be that as it may. Supply of 4 Gen sets was originally supplied . The\n\n                dispute raised by the Petitioner that the supply was not according to the terms of\n\n                the contract and without proper spare parts. A notice was also issued in this\n\n                regard on 26.03.2010. In the reply notice the Respondent has agreed to set right\n\n                the defects if any, before 22.04.2010. Though the parties are governed by the\n\n                contract to refer the dispute for Arbitration after exhausting the friendly\n\n                consultation between the parties, without exhausting such process, criminal\n\n                complaint appears to have been lodged for cheating, against both the Respondents\n\n                on 04.10.2010 despite the fact that the 1st Respondent discharged in view of the\n\n                Tripartite Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                Page 13 / 28</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                                                                     O.P.No.454 of 2014</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">                          13. Be that as it may.      Based on the orders of this Court in\n\n                Crl.O.P.No.27542 of 2010 dated 14.12.2010 FIR was registered by the Police\n\n                against the Respondents on 29.12.2010 u/s 420 r/w 34 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">I.P.C</a>. In the meanwhile\n\n                2nd Respondent issued notice on 09.09.2012 for referring the dispute to the\n\n                Arbitration, for which a reply has been sent by the Petitioner, outrightly rejecting\n\n                the reference by taking a stand that since the serious allegation of fraud and\n\n                manipulation of account to cheat has raised against the Respondent, the same\n\n                cannot be decided by Arbitration. This reply was sent by the Petitioner on\n\n                28.12.2012 and it appears that the Respondent has moved before this Court to\n\n                quash the FIR filed against them, in Crl.O.P.No.17261 of 2012 mainly on the\n\n                ground that the dispute     is arbitrable and the parties are governed by the\n\n                arbitration. This court, however, dismissed the above application held that the\n\n                relevant arbitration clause and other question will not have to be allowed to\n\n                continue further in view of the criminal prosecution is launched. It appears that\n\n                the above order was also challenged before the Apex Court and the same was also\n\n                dismissed. In the meanwhile the Respondent has obtained Anticipatory Bail vide\n\n                order dated 19.12.2013 which was challenged by the Petition before the Apex\n\n                Court.

It is also relevant to note\n\n                that a complaint was also filed before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal\n\n                Commission by the Petitioner for the deficiency of service, which was dismissed\n\n                by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on 3.12.2012 itself,\n\n                wherein the complaint was dismissed at the admission stage itself and held that\n\n                nothing will preclude the complaint to seek remedy from appropriate forum or\n\n                civil Court.       Even after dismissal of the complaint before the National\n\n                Commission, no action has been taken either to invoke the arbitration clause by\n\n                the Petitioner herein. This application has been filed for appointment of\n\n                Arbitration under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act on 24.07.2014 for the first time. It is to\n\n                be noted that admittedly no notice issued to invoke arbitration by the Petitioner.\n\n                Though the dispute arose in the year 2010, from the date of reply on 26.03.2010,\n\n                the Petitioner have not issued any notice for invocation of Arbitration.

From the conjoint reading of the above makes it very clear that\n\n                appointment of Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/1067630/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 11(4)</a> and (6) arose only when the party\n\n                failed to act as required under the procedure. The procedure contemplated in\n\n                <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 11</a> of the Act is issuance of notice and other side fails to appoint an\n\n                arbitrator within a period of thirty days from the receipt of a request from the\n\n                other party. Admittedly no notice was issued by the Petitioner in this case. The\n\n                dispute arose in the year 2010 itself and till now notice of invocation has not\n\n                issued. On the other side the Petitioner has prosecuted the criminal case from the\n\n                year 2010 and also filed Consumer Complaint in the year 2012. In fact when the\n\n                Arbitration was invoked by the 2nd Respondent issuing notice on 9.9.2012, the\n\n                Petitioner in fact strongly objected to refer the issue to the Arbitration.

The combined reading of entire <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/138599/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 21</a> of the\n\n                Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, make it very clear that the proceedings\n\n                will be commenced on the date on which a request for dispute to be referred to\n\n                Arbitration is received by the Respondent. Therefore, the notice of invocation is\n\n                very much essential in view of the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11</a> of the Act, which\n\n                has not been done so. Further the Petitioner has cautiously prosecuting the matter\n\n                in criminal side, consumer forum and also challenged the bail application before\n\n                the Apex Court, even then the Petitioner has not referred the matter to the\n\n                Arbitration.
