IMS Learning Resources Private Limited, the respondent  herein,  filed\nCS (OS) No.2316 of 2011 in the High Court  of  Delhi  at  New  Delhi  for  a\npermanent injunction restraining infringement  of  a  registered  trademark,\ninfringement of copyright, passing off of damages, rendition of accounts  of\nprofits and also for  other  consequential  reliefs  against  the  appellant\nherein.  Appellant preferred IA No.18 of 2012 under  Section  8,  read  with\nSection 5 -of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_1\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> for  rejecting  the\nplaint  and  referring  the  dispute  to  arbitration  and  also  for  other\nconsequential reliefs.  Respondent-plaintiff raised objection  to  the  said\napplication stating that the suit  is  perfectly  maintainable.    The  High\nCourt rejected the application vide its order dated 16.04.2012 holding  that\nthat earlier agreements dated 01.04.2007  and  01.04.2010,  which  contained\narbitration clause stood superseded  by  a  new  contract  dated  01.02.2011\narrived at between the parties by mutual consent.   Defendant  aggrieved  by\nthe said order filed FAO (OS) No.290 of 2012 before the  Division  Bench  of\nthe Delhi High Court, which confirmed the order of the learned Single  Judge\nand dismissed the appeal against which this appeal  has  been  preferred  by\nspecial leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Mr. Manu T. Ramachandran, learned counsel appearing for the  appellant\nraised the following question of law:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      “a)   Whether an arbitration  clause  is  a  collateral  term  in  the\n      contract, which relates to resolution of disputes, and not performance\n      and even if the performance of the contract comes to an end on account\n      of repudiation, frustration of breach  of  contract,  the  arbitration\n      agreement would survive for the  purpose  of  resolution  of  disputes\n      arising under or in connection with the contract?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      b)    Whether the impugned judgment is contrary to the law settled  by\n      this Hon’ble Court in Branch -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140286\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"200767\" id=\"span_2\">Manager, /s <a href=\"/doc/200767/\" id=\"a_2\">Magma Leasing &amp; Finance Limited  and  another  v.

Learned  counsel  also  submitted  that  arbitration  clause   is   a\ncollateral term in the contract, which relates  to  resolution  of  disputes\nand not performance and even if the performance of the contract comes to  an\nend on account of  repudiation,  frustration  of  breach  of  contract,  the\narbitration agreement  would  survive  for  the  purpose  of  resolution  of\ndisputes arising  under  or  in  connection  with  the  contract.    Learned\ncounsel also submitted that the court has erroneously held that the case  of\nthe appellant is not a case involving the assertion  by  the  respondent  of\naccord and satisfaction in respect of  earlier  contracts,  especially  when\nthe sole purpose of the Exit paper dated 01.02.2011 was to  put  an  end  to\nthe contractual relationship  between  them  under  the  -aforesaid  earlier\ncontracts.  Apart from the decisions  referred  hereinbefore,  reliance  was\nalso placed on the judgment of the  U.S.  Court  in  Nolde  Bros.,  Inc.  v.\nBakery Workers 430 US 243.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.     Mr.  Sai  Krishna  Rajgopal,  learned  counsel  appearing   for   the\nrespondent placing reliance on  the  detailed  counter  affidavit  filed  on\nbehalf of the respondent  submitted  that  the  arbitration  clause  in  the\nagreements dated 01.04.2007 and 01.04.2010 cannot be invoked since both  the\nabove-mentioned  agreements  were  superseded  and  abrogated  by  the   new\nagreement dated 01.02.2011.  Learned counsel also submitted that in the  new\nagreement it was mutually decided by the parties that any violation  of  the\nrespondent’s trade mark IMS would  entitle  the  respondent  to  take  legal\nrecourse against the appellant.  Reference was  made  to  clause  4  of  the\npenultimate paragraph  of  the  new  agreement  dated  01.02.2011.   Learned\ncounsel also submitted that Suit No. CS (OS)  2316  of  2011  was  based  on\nprior trade mark rights and not  on  the  agreements  dated  01.04.2007  and\n01.04.2010.  Further it was also pointed out that the  new  agreement  dated\n01.02.2011 records  the  mutual  agreement  between  the  parties  that  the\nappellant shall not be eligible to use -the trade mark IMS in any  form  and\nany breach thereof entitles respondent to seek legal recourse  on  violation\nof trade mark IMS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.    We are of the view that survival of the arbitration clause, as  sought\nby the appellant in the agreements dated 01.04.2007 and  01.04.2010  has  to\nbe seen in the light of the terms and conditions of the new agreement  dated\n01.02.2011.  An arbitration clause in an agreement  cannot  survive  if  the\nagreement containing arbitration clause has  been  superseded/novated  by  a\nlater agreement.  The agreement dated  01.04.2010  contained  the  following\narbitration clause:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      “20.  Arbitration\n      All disputes and questions whatsoever which may arise, either  during\n      the substance of this agreement or afterwards,  between  the  parties\n      shall be referred to the arbitration of trhe managing director of IMS\n      Learning Resources Pvt. Ltd. Or  his  nominee  and  such  arbitration\n      shall be in the English language at Mumbai.  The arbitration shall be\n      governed by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_6\">Arbitration and  Conciliation  Act,\n      1996</a> or any other statutory modification or re-enactment thereof  for\n      the time being in force and award or awards of such arbitrator  shall\n      be binding on all the parties to the said dispute.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">7.    We have now to examine terms of the subsequent agreement titled  “Exit\npaper” dated 01.02.2011. It is the common case of the parties that the  Exit\npaper/agreement entered into -between  the  parties  does  not  contain  any\narbitration clause.  It is useful to extract the  relevant  portion  of  the\nExit paper, which is as follow:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      “With reference to  your  mail/letter  dated  1st  February,  2011  on\n      closing the center, from the aforesaid date  with  mutual  consent  we\n      have agreed on the following:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      “1.  Enrolled students\n      All enrolled students of IMS with you will be  serviced  by  you  with\n      respect to their classes, workshops and conduct of test series,  GD/PI\n      and any other servicing required as per the product manual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">      2.    Premises\n      IMS will  reserve  the  first  right  of  utilization  to  occupy  the\n      premises.  In an eventuality of IMS exercising the right  to  use  the\n      premises,  then  IMS  will  reimburse  the  monthly   rent   for   the\n      corresponding months before changing the  rental  agreement  onto  IMS\n      name.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">      3.    Marketing\n      From the above-mentioned date you are not eligible to do any marketing\n      and promotional activities in the name of IMS.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">      4.    Brand\n      “From the above-mentioned date you are not eligible to use  IMS  brand\n      in any form.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      5.    Monthly claims\n      The partner abides to deposit all the course fees collected for any of\n      IMS programs till now as per the deposit policy of IMS.   All  monthly\n      claims will be settled till 31st January, 2011 and the claims would be\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">      -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">      released after the date of termination of the partner agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">      6.    Security Deposit\n      The security deposit amount will be refunded back  to  you  after  the\n      completion of servicing of all enrolled IMS students.  In case of  any\n      due on partner to the company (unsettled fees,  loan  or  advance  for\n      centre activities  etc.),  same  amount  will  be  deducted  from  the\n      security deposit.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">      7.    Non Compete Clause\n      The partner has averred that neither he, nor his  family  members  are\n      directly  or  indirectly  interested  in  any   business   in   direct\n      competition with that of IMS and the partner agrees and undertakes  to\n      ensure that neither he nor his family members shall be involved in  or\n      connected to any business in direct competition with that  of  IMS  at\n      any time during the currency of  this  agreement  and  for  a  further\n      period of six months therafter.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">      8.    Full and final settlement\n      I/We accept all the  above-mentioned  points  and  confirm  that  upon\n      receipt of the sum stated hereinafter in full and final settlement  of\n      all my/our claims, neither me/we nor any person claiming by or through\n      me/us shall have any further claims against IMS whatsoever.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">      Any violation of points 1,3,4,5  &amp;  7  from  the  partner’s  end  will\n      attract legal course of action and penalties  from  IMS  ranging  from\n      forfeiture of the security deposit &amp; pending claims.\n      I hereby accept above terms and conditions.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_5\">8.    Exit paper would  clearly  indicate  that  it  is  a  mutually  agreed\ndocument containing comprehensive terms  and  conditions  which  -admittedly\ndoes not contain an arbitration clause.  We are of the view  that  the  High\nCourt is right in taking the view that in the case on hand, is  not  a  case\ninvolving assertion by the respondent of accord a  satisfaction  in  respect\nof the earlier contracts dated 01.04.2007 and 01.04.2010.  If  that  be  so,\nit could have referred to arbitrator in terms of those two agreements  going\nby the dictum in <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_7\">Union of India v. Kishorilal Gupta and Bros</a>.  AIR  1959  SC\n1362.  This Court in Kishorilal Gupta’s case (supra) examined  the  question\nwhether an arbitration clause can be invoked in the case of a dispute  under\na superseded contract.  The principle laid down is that if the  contract  is\nsuperseded by another, the arbitration clause, being  a  component  part  of\nthe earlier contract, falls with it.  But where the dispute is whether  such\ncontract is void ab intio, the arbitration clause cannot  operate  on  those\ndisputes, for  its  operative  force  depends  upon  the  existence  of  the\ncontract and its validity.  The various  other  observations  were  made  by\nthis Court in the above-mentioned judgment  in  respect  of  “settlement  of\ndisputes arising under the original contract, including the  dispute  as  to\nthe breach of the contract and its consequences”.</span>    Principle <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_8\">laid down  by</a>\nthe House of Lords in Heyman v. Darwins Limited 1942 (1) All. E.R. -337  was\nalso relied on by this Court for its conclusion.  The Collective  bargaining\nprinciple laid down by the US Supreme Court  in  Nolde  Bros.  case  (supra)\nwould not apply to the facts of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">9.    We may indicate that so far as the present case is concerned,  parties\nhave entered into a fresh contract contained in the Exit  paper  which  does\nnot even indicate any disputes arising under the original contract or  about\nthe settlement thereof, it is nothing but a pure and simple novation of  the\noriginal contract by mutual consent.  Above  being  the  factual  and  legal\nposition, we find no error in  the  view  taken  by  the  High  Court.   The\nappeal, therefore, lacks merit and stands dismissed, with  no  order  as  to\ncosts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                                                               ……………………..…J.\n                                                        (K.S.
