The present petition is filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the\n                          Constitution of India by IDBI Bank Ltd., praying inter alia--(1)\n                          quashing of the invocation notice dated 15.10.2018 issued by the\n                          respondent no.1, wherein certain bank guarantees furnished by the\n                          petitioner have been invoked; and (2) a direction to the respondents to\n                          return the bank guarantees furnished by the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">                          2.     The facts material to the present dispute are that in the year\n                          2011, Uttar Pradesh Power Transmission Corporation Limited\n                          declared one Isolux Corsan Concesiones S.A. (hereinafter &#x27;Isolux&#x27;) as\n                          the successful bidder for a project that, inter alia, was for providing\n                          transmission services to various long-term transmission customers in\n                          the State of Uttar Pradesh (hereinafter &#x27;said project&#x27;). Isolux, along\n                          with another company, formed respondent no.3 (a joint venture\n                          company) for the purposes of executing the said Project. The\n                          respondent no.3 in turn engaged the respondent no.2 for executing the\n                          said project.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">                          3.     On 10.02.2012, in order to define the terms of the work, three\n                          agreements were entered into between the respondent nos.2 and 3, viz.,\n                          Civil Works Agreement, Supply Agreement and Services Agreement\n                          (hereinafter &#x27;Definitive Agreements&#x27;). The Definitive Agreements\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Signing Date:18.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">16:34:18</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                             -3-</span>\n\n\n                          provided that the respondent no.3 was entitled to withhold as\n                          &quot;retentions&quot; part of the payments from the periodic payments after 30\n                          days from the issuance of Taking Over Certificate/Service Completion\n                          Certificate/Supply Completion Certificate and the balance after expiry\n                          of the Defect Liability Period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">                          4.    On 25.02.2014, all the Definitive Agreements were amended so\n                          as to provide that the retention amount would be released by the\n                          respondent no.3, if the respondent no.2, furnishes bank guarantee\n                          (hereinafter &#x27;BGs&#x27;) for an amount equivalent to the retention amount\n                          in favour of the respondent no.3. On the other side of things, the\n                          respondent no.3 and the respondent no.1, along with some other\n                          parties, had entered into a Common Term Loan Agreement\n                          (hereinafter &#x27;term loan agreement&#x27;) on 28.02.2014 for a total amount\n                          of Rs.3,713.25 crore.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">                          5.    Subsequently, the petitioner from 30.12.2014 to 30.10.2015\n                          issued seven BGs at the instance of the respondent no.2 for a total\n                          amount of Rs.58.5 crore, in which the respondent no.3 was the\n                          beneficiary who thereafter assigned the BGs in favour of the\n                          respondent no.1, with the consent of the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">                          6.    On 10.10.2018, the respondent no.1 issued a notice to\n                          respondent no.3 recalling the loan facility availed by the respondent\n                          no.3 under the term loan agreement and demanded that the respondent\n                          no.3 forthwith pays the outstanding amount. Thereafter, on\n                          15.10.2018, the respondent no.1 sent an invocation notice to the\n                          petitioner invoking the BGs and calling upon the petitioner to pay\n                          forthwith the amounts so mentioned in the BGs. The petitioner being\n                          aggrieved by the invocation notice, filed the instant petition\n                          challenging the same.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Signing Date:18.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">16:34:18</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                              -4-</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">                          7.    Ms. Maninder Acharya, the learned senior counsel for the\n                          petitioner made the following broad submissions - firstly, that the\n                          BGs were in lieu of the retention monies as provided for in the\n                          Definitive Agreements, which in turn provided that the retention\n                          monies were to be released after the completion of the work. As the\n                          work has been completed, the petitioner is therefore discharged from\n                          its obligations under the BGs. She specifically places reliance on\n                          Clauses 2 and 3 of the BGs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">                          8.    Secondly, after taking this court through Clause 3 of the BGs,\n                          the invocation notice and loan recall notice of the respondent no.1,\n                          learned senior counsel has contended that the BGs were issued for a\n                          specific purpose, that is, for the retention monies as provided for in the\n                          Definitive Agreements; and since the basis of the invocation of the\n                          BGs is failure of respondent no.3 to honour its obligations under the\n                          term loan agreement, the same is bad in law, as being contrary to the\n                          terms of the BGs itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                          9.    Thirdly, the petitioner&#x27;s agreement and acknowledgement of the\n                          assignment of BGs in favour of the respondent no.1, was done while\n                          honouring the terms of the BGs, and no derogation was made\n                          therefrom. The assignment, it is argued, was therefore, specifically for\n                          the purpose of retention monies provided for in the Definitive\n                          Agreements. The learned senior counsel in support of her arguments\n                          took this court through various communications that took place\n                          between the petitioner and the respondent nos.1 and 3, specifically\n                          letters dated 30.12.2014, 31.03.2015, 30.07.2015, 12.08.2015 and\n                          30.10.2015, issued by the petitioner, in which the issuance for\n                          assignment was acknowledged and reference was made to Clauses 10\n                          and 11 of the BGs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Signing Date:18.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">16:34:18</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                              -5-</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          10.    Fourthly, an egregious fraud has taken place where all the\n                          respondents in connivance with each other have taken advantage of\n                          the petitioner, i.e., IDBI Bank Ltd., and tricked the bank into giving\n                          BGs whilst from the very beginning, having a fraudulent intention of\n                          assigning the BGs later. The petitioner-IDBI Bank Ltd. contends that\n                          the respondent no.2 and the respondent no.3 are fellow subsidiaries,\n                          having seven common Directors between them, and thereby, being\n                          under the control of a common management, were aware of the\n                          financial position of one another. Therefore, it is argued, that the\n                          respondent nos.2 and 3 had a fraudulent motive for procuring the BGs\n                          with an objective of ultimately assigning it qua the obligations of the\n                          term loan agreement. They placed reliance on the Grant Thornton&#x27;s\n                          Forensic Audit Report dated 19.06.2020, and the Supplementary\n                          Forensic Audit Report dated 28.07.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">                          11.   Fifthly, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits that\n                          the respondent no.2 is presently undergoing liquidation, and the\n                          petitioner would, therefore, not be in a position to exercise its right of\n                          subrogation and recover the amounts from respondent no.2. There\n                          would thus be irreparable harm and irretrievable injustice if this court\n                          does not restrain the invocation of the BGs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                          12.   Sixthly, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner submits\n                          that in fact there are no disputed questions of facts, as the respondents\n                          have not disputed that the BGs were invoked on account of failure of\n                          the respondent no.3 to pay the amounts due under the term loan\n                          agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                          13.   Seventhly, it is submitted that the relief(s) sought by the\n                          petitioner are primarily against the fraudulent acts so committed by the\n                          parties invoking the respective BGs in contravention to the terms of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Signing Date:18.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">16:34:18</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                              -6-</span>\n\n\n                          the respective BGs, which are Government of India undertakings and\n                          therefore, a &#x27;State&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 12</a> of the\n                          Constitution of India. Thus, it is argued that they are amenable to the\n                          writ jurisdiction of this court, inasmuch as it is contended that even for\n                          enforcing a contractual obligation against the State, a writ petition\n                          under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">                          14.     Lastly, and in furtherance of the above, it is also contended by\n                          the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the practice of writ\n                          courts not delving into disputes arising out of contracts has been\n                          carved out when an aspect of public law is involved. They contend\n                          that since the said Project was for setting up of a transmission system\n                          in Mainpuri, UP, there is a public law character involved. It is also\n                          argued that considering the entire conspectus of facts, the respondent\n                          no.1 has acted in an arbitrary and unfair manner, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 14</a>\n                          of the Constitution of India is violated. Moreover, since the present\n                          petition is being pending for quite some time, this court must decide\n                          this matter on merits instead of considering the same on the issue of\n                          maintainability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">                          15.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"851066\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"113707\" id=\"span_23\">In support of the arguments, the learned senior counsel relies\n                          upon the following decisions: <a href=\"/doc/113707/\" id=\"a_5\">Century Spinning &amp; Manufacturing\n                          Co.

The respondent no.1 filed the counter affidavit and made\n                          various submissions. However, at this stage, the detailed submission\n                          on merit need not be considered, as a preliminary objection has been\n                          raised by respondent no.3 regarding the maintainability of this\n                          petition. However, Mr.Sanjay Jain, learned ASG, appearing for\n                          respondent no.1 unequivocally submitted that the petition is\n                          maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                          17.    Per contra, Mr. Venkatesh, the learned counsel for the\n                          respondent no.3, made the following submissions - firstly, that the\n                          petitioner has no locus in the contractual matter and cannot be\n                          permitted to resile from its commitment. Secondly, it is contended,\n                          that even if it is assumed that the obligation of the petitioner under the\n                          BGs came to an end, and the petitioner was thereby discharged when\n                          the project achieved completion, the determination as to whether the\n                          project has actually been completed or not, is to be determined not by\n                          the petitioner but by the parties to the Definitive Agreements.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                          6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                            (2004) 3 SCC 553.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                          7</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                            2019 SCC Online SC 447.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                          8</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">                            2021 SCC Online SC 99.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                          9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                           2023 SCC OnLine SC 116.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                          10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">                             AIR 1980 Delhi 174.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                          11</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Signature Not Verified       2021 SCC OnLine Mad 5637.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                          12</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">                              (2023) 2 SCC 703\nSigning Date:18.05.2023\n16:34:18\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                -8-</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">                          18.      Thirdly, after relying upon the landmark case of Whirlpool\n                          Corporation v. Registrar of Trademarks13, the learned counsel\n                          contends that the case of the petitioner does not fit in any of the\n                          exceptions to the doctrine of alternate remedy. It is further argued that\n                          the purported irretrievable injustice is not an injustice but a\n                          consequence specifically agreed upon by the petitioner in terms of the\n                          BGs. Specific reliance is placed on Clause 6 of the BGs, which\n                          provides that termination, amendment, dissolution, or reorganisation\n                          of respondent no.2 would not release or discharge the petitioner. Even\n                          assuming there is irretrievable injustice that is caused by the\n                          petitioner, the learned counsel argued that this in itself cannot be a\n                          ground to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_46\">19.      Fourthly, to specifically rebut the contention of the petitioner\n                          that writ jurisdiction may be invoked even when the dispute lies in the\n                          realm of private law in cases where a public law aspect is involved, it\n                          is argued by the learned counsel for the respondent no. 3, that there is\n                          no involvement of public law in this matter. The learned counsel states\n                          that while engaging in the act so impugned by the petitioner, the\n                          respondent no.1 was not discharging a public duty or public function.\n                          It is their case that invoking a bank guarantee, assigning it, or entering\n                          into any such agreement, is not a part of discharging a public duty or\n                          function. To that end, if the entirety of the matter is governed by a\n                          contract and falls under contract law, the matter cannot be decided by\n                          a writ court. Specific reliance is placed on a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble\n                          Supreme Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_12\">Joshi Technologies International\n                          INC v.

Fifthly, while placing reliance on the terms of the BGs,\n                          specifically Clause 3, on which the petitioner also relied, it is\n                          contended that the invocation of guarantee has taken place within the\n                          four corners of the law. It is submitted by the learned counsel, that the\n                          only pre-requisite that needed to be complied with for the invocation\n                          of the guarantee was the raising of a demand, which has been done by\n                          respondent no.1. Sixthly, on the contention of fraud, it is argued by the\n                          respondent no.3 that the BGs, specifically Clause 11, itself envisages\n                          the assignment of the debt in favour of the long-term lender, i.e., the\n                          respondent no.1. Therefore, in hindsight, the petitioner cannot claim\n                          that it could not have contemplated the assignment in favour of the\n                          respondent no.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"90140896\" id=\"span_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"72238050\" id=\"span_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"156037084\" id=\"span_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"514858\" id=\"span_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"460900\" id=\"span_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"90640571\" id=\"span_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"64125057\" id=\"span_59\">21.

The first and foremost issue which lies at the core of the present\n                          dispute is whether this court should delve into the issues so raised to\n                          be adjudicated under its writ jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">                          24.    The submissions of the parties would reveal that at its core, the\n                          present issue is of private law. For instance:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                          a.    The petitioner, after taking this court through the BGs\n                                specifically Clause 3, the invocation demand letter and loan\n                                recall notice of respondent no.1, contended that the BGs were\n                                issued for a specific purpose, that is, for the retention monies as\n                                provided for in the Definitive Agreements, and since the basis of\n                                the invocation of the BGs is the failure of the respondent no.3 to\n                                honour its obligations under the term loan agreement, the same is\n                                bad in law, as being contrary to the very terms of the BGs itself.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                          b.    Per contra, the respondent no.3 while placing reliance on the\n                                terms of the BGs, specifically Clause 3 on which the petitioner\n                                also relied, contends that the invocation of guarantee has taken\n                                place within the four corners of the law. It is submitted by the\n                                learned counsel, that the only pre-requisite that needed to be\n                                complied with for the invocation of the guarantee was the raising\n                                of a demand, which has been done by respondent no. 1.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                          24</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                             (2022) 281 DLT 135.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                          25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Signature Not Verified        (1999) 49 DRJ.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                          26</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                             2021 SCC OnLine Bom 12678.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">Signing Date:18.05.2023\n16:34:18\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">                                                              - 11 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">                          25.   Similar submissions have also been made on other issues. Since\n                          this court is not inclined to go into the merits of this case, therefore,\n                          they are not being dealt with at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">                          26.   Each of the issues so mentioned above, fall exclusively in the\n                          domain of private law and are fundamentally contractual in nature.\n                          There is no element of public law that this court finds involved in the\n                          present petition. The mere fact that the parties engaging in the contract\n                          are State or its instrumentalities, does not in itself make the issue\n                          relevant to public law. There is no determination of the rights relating\n                          to public law, nor is there a consideration relating to the public at large\n                          that needs to be factored in while deciding the dispute so argued by\n                          the parties. Issuance of the BGs by the petitioner at the instance of\n                          respondent no.2 in the favour of respondent no.3 and its encashment is\n                          purely governed by the terms of the BGs. The same is the commercial\n                          wisdom of the parties. It concerns the legal relationship between the\n                          parties involved, namely, the bank and the beneficiary of the\n                          guarantee. The enforcement is not the result of any administrative\n                          order or State act involving the exercise of State power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">                          27.   The bank, before issuing BGs, is supposed to conduct a\n                          thorough credit analysis of the customer. It has to evaluate the credit\n                          worthiness and financial stability of the customer to ensure that the\n                          customer has the capacity to fulfil its obligation under the BGs. The\n                          likelihood of dispute or default are also some of the factors which\n                          need to be evaluated before a decision is taken to issue the BGs. The\n                          bank is also supposed to obtain adequate security to protect its interest\n                          in the event of default. If the bank has failed in its assessment or\n                          proper risk evaluation, the same cannot be the reason to enterain a writ\n                          petition. Moreover, all those aspects will have to be gone into, once\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">Signed By:PRATIMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Signing Date:18.05.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">16:34:18</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                                                               - 12 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">                          the parties are allowed to adduce sufficient evidence before the\n                          competent court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">                          28.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_83\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_84\">In <a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_24\">Joshi Technologies International INC v.

The position thus summarized in the aforesaid principles has\n                                 to be understood in the context of discussion that preceded which\n                                 we have pointed out above. As per this, no doubt, there is no\n                                 absolute bar to the maintainability of the writ petition even in\n                                 contractual matters or where there are disputed questions of fact or\n                                 even when monetary claim is raised.

We find that there is a merit in the first contention of Mr.\n                                    Rawal. Learned Counsel has rightly questioned the maintainability\n                                    of the writ petition. The interpretation and implementation of a\n                                    clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ\n                                    petition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                    Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is a\n                                    question of construction of contract? If a term of a contract is\n                                    violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the writ petition under\n                                    <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 226.</a> We are also unable to agree with the observations of\n                                    the High Court that the contractor was seeking enforcement of a\n                                    statutory contract. A contract would not become statutory simply\n                                    because it is for construction of a public utility and it has been\n                                    awarded by a statutory body. We are also unable to agree with the\n                                    observation of the High Court that since the obligations imposed\n                                    by the contract on the contracting parties come within the\n                                    purview of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_38\">Contract Act</a>, that would not make the contract\n                                    statutory. Clearly, the High Court fell into an error in coming to\n                                    the conclusion that the contract in question was statutory in\n                                    nature.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                    11. A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a\n                                    statutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to\n                                    discharge Its functions. Dispute arising out of the terms of such\n                                    contracts or alleged breaches have to be settled by the ordinary\n                                    principles of law of contract. The fact that one of the parties to\n                                    the agreement is a statutory or public body will not of itself affect\n                                    the principles to be applied. The disputes about the meaning of a\n                                    covenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be determined\n                                    according to the usual principles of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_39\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of\n                                    a statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of\n                                    statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private parties, have power\n                                    to contract or deal with property. Such activities may not raise\n                                    any issue of public law. In the present case, it has not been shown\n                                    how the contract is statutory. The contract between the parties is\n                                    in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory contract. The\n                                    disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of\n                                    such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under\n                                    <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for\n                                    adjudication by a civil Court or in arbitration if provided for in\n                                    the contract. Whether any amount is due and if so, how much\n                                    and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or not, are not the\n                                    matters which could have been agitated and decided in a writ\n                                    petition.

They are contractual\n                                 undertakings, normally granted by banks, to pay or repay, a\n                                 specified sum in the event of any default in performance by the\n                                 principal debtor of some other contract with a third party, the\n                                 creditor. Sometimes the bank‟s liability arises on mere demand by\n                                 the creditor, notwithstanding that it may appear on the evidence\n                                 that the principal debtor is not in any way in default, or even that\n                                 the creditor himself is in default under the principal contract. Such\n                                 guarantees are sometimes called &quot;first demand guarantees&quot; or\n                                 &quot;demand bonds&quot;. It has been held that performance guarantees of\n                                 this nature are analogous to a bank‟s letter of credit, and that the\n                                 bank‟s liability is of a primary nature which is unaffected by\n                                 allegations that the creditor is in breach of the main contract\n                                 between him and the principal debtor. The question whether a\n                                 particular instrument (such as a &quot;refund guarantee&quot;) takes the\n                                 form of an independent performance bond (or stand-by letter of\n                                 credit) or a true &quot;see to it&quot; guarantee is one of construction of the\n                                 instrument in its factual and contractual context having regard to\n                                 its commercial purpose. While there may be a number of\n                                 indications in an instrument which argue in favour of it being a\n                                 &quot;true guarantee&quot; or, conversely, an &quot;on-demand bond&quot;,\n                                 &quot;[w]here an instrument (i) relates to an underlying transaction\n                                 between the parties in different jurisdictions, (ii) is issued by a\n                                 bank, (iii) contains an undertaking to pay „on demand‟ (with or\n                                 without the words „first‟ and/or „written‟) and (iv) does not contain\n                                 clauses excluding or limiting the defences available to a guarantor,\n                                 it will almost always be construed as a demand guarantee.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">                                 On the other hand, there is a &quot;strong presumption&quot; that a\n                                 &quot;guarantee&quot; concluded other than by a bank is not a demand or\n                                 independent performance bond, although this presumption may be\n                                 rebutted.

It is further argued that since the said project has been\n                          completed, as per the terms of the Definitive Agreements and the BGs,\n                          they must be discharged and, in the alternative, since the competition\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">Signature Not Verified    date has passed, the liabilities must be reduced by fifty per cent.

This averment has been vehemently denied by the\n                          respondents herein. This court is of the view that the determination of\n                          this issue is a question of fact and requires leading of evidence and\n                          interpretation of the contract. This exercise cannot be done in the writ\n                          jurisdiction. The second part of the argument is contingent upon a\n                          previous claim - that despite the assignment, the invocation of the BGs\n                          can only take place when a breach is made under the Definitive\n                          Agreements. In other words, even after the assignment, the terms of\n                          the Definitive Agreements control the invocation of the BGs. This is\n                          again an issue belonging to the domain of leading of evidence and\n                          interpretation of the contract, which this court, in its writ jurisdiction,\n                          is not inclined to embark upon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"851066\" id=\"span_124\">45.

Firstly, in the\n                          present case, it must be considered that the parties herein are\n                          financially sound having adequate resources. There was nothing,\n                          therefore, that prevented the parties from approaching appropriate\n                          forums and agitating their disputes. Secondly, the case concerned does\n                          not act as an authoritative binding precedent which rules that the High\n                          Court must, in cases where a delay has been caused, entertain a\n                          petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">                          46.   This court is of the considered opinion, that the present petition,\n                          involves disputed questions of facts; has a purely contractual origin\n                          without any aspect of public law; and that the petitioner has an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">Signature Not Verified    alternative remedy to pursue.

The maintainability of\n                          the writ petition must be entertained or not, is a matter that can be\n                          determined by this court either at the threshold or at the stage of final\n                          disposal. The mere passage of time is not a ground to entertain a writ\n                          petition, which is either not found to be maintainable or the court,\n                          while considering the overall facts and circumstances, comes to the\n                          conclusion that the same ought not to be entertained and the parties\n                          may be relegated to more appropriate civil remedies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">                          47.   This is not to say that if a subsequent act has led to the alternate\n                          remedy being foreclosed, the court must not give due weightage to the\n                          same, but rather that the dominant lens of analysis must be from the\n                          perspective of the original filing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">                          48.   Insofar as the argument of the petitioner that irretrievable harm\n                          and injustice would be caused since respondent no.2 is undergoing\n                          liquidation and the petitioner would not be able to recover any\n                          amount, is concerned, this court finds it to have no basis. It is true that\n                          it causes inconvenience and may even be considered unjust in the\n                          moral sense, but in law, financial inconvenience cannot be considered\n                          as irretrievable harm or injustice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">                          49.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113707\" id=\"span_129\">In <a href=\"/doc/113707/\" id=\"a_57\">Century Spinning &amp; Manufacturing Co.

In\n                          the present petition, the petitioner has not been able to persuade this\n                          court that their fundamental right has been violated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">                          54.    This court finds that further observations deserve to be made in\n                          relation to the two above-mentioned cases. Firstly, neither of the cases\n                          set out an authoritative dictum of the nature such that in the present\n                          facts and circumstances, the writ petition must necessarily be\n                          maintained. The general rule, appreciated even in the two above-\n                          mentioned judgements, remains that the relief is essentially\n                          discretionary, and must not be granted where disputed questions of\n                          facts, contractual origins of dispute, and alternate efficacious remedies\n                          exist. Secondly, it must also be considered that both the above\n                          mentioned cases were appeals from decisions of a single judge where\n                          the concerned writ petitions were entertained. The decisions of the\n                          Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court are then ratifying the discretion exercised by\n                          the respective single judges on the grounds so considered by the Apex\n                          Court. Broadly speaking, the said decisions give reasons as to why the\n                          exercise of discretion is correct. They, however, are not concerned\n                          with the issue--whether the non-exercise of discretion would have\n                          been incorrect. It is to be remembered, that the relief under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 226</a>\n                          of the Constitution of India, is primarily discretionary, and in the\n                          absence of the two decisions ruling upon the non-exercise of\n                          discretion being against the law, the said decisions do not persuade\n                          this court to entertain the present petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">                          55.
