Learned Judge has not considered the\n    said argument of the defendant in true spirit\n    and         proper     perspective              for       the      purpose            of\n    calculation            of    the    period           for     filing         of     the\n    suit. As per the case of the plaintiff, cause of\n    action has occurred in the year 1983. For the\n    sake of argument, without admitting, even if it\n    is accepted that from the year 1989, the Clause\n    of      &quot;labour        escalation&quot;              is      inserted           in      the\n    contract then also within a period of 3 years\n    from the date of cause of action, the period of\n    limitation            would     start          to      be     commenced            and\n    limitation            would     begin          from         that      day       only.\n    Therefore, the suit is required to be filed as\n    per the statutory provisions and admittedly the\n    present suit is filed in 1996 i.e. after the\n    period of 3 years. Hence, only on this ground\n    the suit is required to be dismissed.

Therefore,              the\n    defendants are not liable to pay the amount of\n    difference of wage rate due to labour escalation\n    for skilled labourers.

At the relevant point of time, they\n    have not raised any protest or objection about\n    the said bill. Plaintiff&#x27;s witness has admitted\n    in a very categorical terms during the cross-\n    examination that the cheque of Rs.79,052-50 ps.\n    was issued on 7.3.1994 and another cheque of\n    Rs.1,18,962.74           ps.        was        given       on      29.9.1994\n    towards running bill.                         Said witness has also\n    admitted that cheque was issued towards payment\n    of running bills and there was no dispute with\n    regard to difference of payment of wage rate.\n    The admission on the part of the said witness\n    goes on to show that the defendants have never\n    paid any amount towards difference of wage rate\n    for the skilled labourers.

A copy of the tender contract, specifications\n     and booklet along with Annexure-A is produced on\n     record. Both the parties have agreed upon the\n     terms &amp; conditions of the contract. As we have\n     gone through the formula of &quot;Schedule-B&quot;.                                          When\n     the parties have entered into an agreement after\n     reading the terms and conditions then it would\n     be binding to all the parties, who are signatory\n     of the contract. It is the specific case of the\n     appellants-defendants that they cannot go beyond\n     the         terms     &amp;       conditions         of      the      contract.            If\n     intention of the GEB, at the time of executing\n     terms and conditions of the contract, was to pay\n     difference of wage rate to the skilled and semi-\n     skilled workers, in that event, they would have\n     specifically mentioned it in the contract. In\n     the formula of calculation, Schedule-B, the word\n     &quot;unskilled worker&quot; is mentioned, however, as per\n     the case of the plaintiff, the same was equally\n     applicable               to     the    skilled           and       semi-skilled\n     workers.

We are in\n    agreement with the said submission put up by the\n    learned advocate for the appellant. In absence\n    of specific averment and/or non-availability of\n    express provision in the contract, liability to\n    pay difference of wage rate, labour escalations\n    for skilled workers cannot be fastened on the\n    head of the appellant-defendant. We are agreeing\n    that at the time of appreciating the documentary\n    evidence produced on record, we have to consider\n    it          harmoniously.      We     have          to     consider            and\n    interpret the terms of contract and also have to\n    take a pragmatic approach. One cannot go beyond\n    the purview of the provisions of the contract.\n    Therefore, we are of the opinion that the terms\n    and         conditions    of    the         contract        can       be     read\n    simply and in a plain manner, as it is mentioned\n    in the contract and, prima facie after going\n    through the conditions of the contract, we are\n    of          the   opinion      that         as     per       the       &quot;labour\n    escalation&quot;          clause,        only         unskilled         labouerer\n    would be entitled to get benefit of wage rate\n    difference         as    per    the         Notification.             We     have\n    tried our level best to verify whether anywhere\n    in the terms of the contract, anywhere category\n    of &quot;skilled labourer&quot; is included or not but we\n    could not find the same.

Thereafter,          plaintiff          had      voluntarily\n    reduced the percentage of L.E. to 80% instead of\n    120%.
