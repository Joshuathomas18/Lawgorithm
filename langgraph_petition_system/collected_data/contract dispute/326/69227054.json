A letter of acceptance\nwas issued on 05.02.2013 by respondent No. 1 and a contract was executed\nbetween the parties on 07.02.2013. The date of commencement of the work\nwas 09.01.2013 and date of completion was 09.01.2016.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.    On 15.03.2013, respondent No. 4 issued PBG in favour of respondent\nNo. 1 on behalf of the petitioner for an amount of Rs. 34,10,00,000/- valid\nupto 10.04.2016. As per the terms of the PBG, it was to remain valid till the\npetitioner&#x27;s obligations were fulfilled under the Contract or until its first\nexpiry whichever was earlier. The PBG was however, extended from time\nto time and finally reduced to a sum of Rs. 31,68,44,008/-.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.    Likewise, on 18.04.2013, RMBG was issued by respondent No. 2 in\nfavour of respondent No. 1 for an amount of Rs. 6,92,17,500/-, subsequently\nrevised to Rs.13,84,35,000/-. The second RMBG was issued by respondent\nNo. 2 in favour of respondent No. 1 on 08.09.2014 for an amount of Rs.\n6,92,17,500/-, subsequently revised to Rs.13,84,35,000/-. The completion\ndate of the project was later extended to 31.08.2016 by an addendum to the\nContract executed on 20.01.2015.         A partial extension of time for\ncompletion of the Project was made by respondent No. 1 on 20.01.2017 for\na period of 11 days. Request of the petitioner for extension of time till\n30.06.2019 elicited no response from respondent No. 1. Subsequent requests\nfor extension were again not responded to. The PBG was however extended\nto 30.06.2019 and the second RMBG was also extended to 30.06.2019.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.

On 11.06.2019, respondent No. 1 informed the petitioner by a letter\nthat it was not in a position to accept the timelines proposed by the petitioner\nand requested the petitioner to complete the occupational certificate\ninspection by 15.06.2019 and to renew the PBG for full value. Attempts to\nresolve the disputes amicably between the parties were unsuccessful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">7.    It is the case of the petitioner that in these circumstances, respondent\nNo. 1 invoked four Bank Guarantees (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;BGs&#x27;)\nagainst the petitioner viz. the three aforementioned and one Advance Bank\nGuarantee. Constrained by this invocation, petitioner filed a petition in this\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 9</a> of the Act being OMP(I)(COMM) 200/2019. The\npetitioner invoked Arbitration Clause vide its letter dated 24.06.2019 and\nintimated the nomination of its Arbitrator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">8.    On 01.07.2019, petitioner terminated the Contract under clause 16.2\nof the Contract on account of respondent No. 1 not issuing payment\ncertificates; not releasing interim payments and malafide invocation BGs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">9.    On 03.07.2019, this Court disposed of the petition under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 9</a> of\nthe Act. The Court directed that the order dated 19.06.2019 passed earlier,\nby which respondent Nos. 2 to 4 had been directed not to transfer the funds\npursuant to the encashment of the BG by respondent No. 1, would continue,\nleaving it open to either party to seek modification/variation of the said\norder before the Arbitral Tribunal, subject to the condition that the petitioner\nshall keep the BGs alive. The Court further observed that since the restraint\norder was on the ground that respondent No. 1 had prima facie not\nestablished that the pre-conditions mentioned in sub-clause 4.2 of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                        Page 3 of 66</span>\n Agreement had been complied with, the order will not prejudice respondent\nNo. 1 from invoking the BGs in accordance with sub-clause 4.2 of the\nAgreement, however, making it clear that such invocation or the arbitration\nproceedings or any challenge to the invocation, shall not be prejudiced by\nany observations made in the order dated 03.07.2019.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">10.   Thereafter, respondent No. 1 issued letter dated 15.07.2019 in which\nit raised claims to the tune of Rs.135.6 crores against the petitioner and also\nsought to terminate the contract by terming the petitioner&#x27;s termination of\nthe contract as invalid. It was mentioned in the notice that respondent No. 1\nhad arrived at a preliminary determination of the claims and the amounts\nmentioned were subject to change, besides reserving the right to raise claims\nunder other heads. Petitioner was called upon to make the payment within\nseven days of the receipt of the notice, failing which interest was payable at\nthe rate of 18% p.a.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">11.   It is the case of the petitioner in the present petition that the issuance\nof letter dated 15.07.2019 is in violation of clauses 4.2, 2.5 and 3.5 as well\nas the judgment dated 03.07.2019. The petitioner replied to the said letter\non 19.07.2019 and pointed out that the said letter was an afterthought and\nthe contract stood terminated at the instance of the petitioner by virtue of\nclause 16.2 of the GCC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">12.   On 23.07.2019, respondent No. 1 nominated its co-Arbitrator in\nresponse to the invocation notice by the petitioner. It is the case of the\npetitioner that on the same day, it was learnt that respondent No. 1 was\nseeking to invoke the PBG and the RMBGs without any notice to the\npetitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">13.

When the matter came up for admission before this Court respondent\nno. 1 had orally undertaken not to encash the BGs in question and the oral\nundertaking is continuing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">15.         Learned senior counsels informed the Court that the Arbitral Tribunal\nhad been constituted and the next dates of hearing fixed before the Tribunal\nwere 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th October, 2019. Both parties, however, insisted\nthat the matter be heard and finally decided by this Court on the question of\ninjunction against invocation and encashment of the BGs rather than being\nleft to the Arbitral Tribunal. During the pendency of the proceedings, the\ndates before the Arbitral Tribunal, as mentioned above, have been cancelled\nat the instance of the petitioner on the ground that the matter is pending in\nthis Court. With the consent of both the parties, the present petition is being\nheard on the merits of the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">16.         Learned senior counsels for the petitioner contend that the present\nagreement between the parties is a unique contract and not a typical Design\nand Build contract and unlike the other run off the mill contracts, has inbuilt\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                          Page 5 of 66</span>\n safeguards against trigger happy invocation of the BGs. It is submitted that\nSub-Clause 4.2 of the GCC which concerns invocation of BGs mandates\nthat the employer shall not make a claim under the Performance Security,\nexcept for the amounts which the employer is entitled to and a detailed\nprocedure has been prescribed to determine the said amounts. Sub-Clause\n4.2 is a negative covenant which prohibits invocation of BGs without first\nquantification of the amount claimed. Sub-Clause 4.2 read with Clause 2.5\nof the GCC and Clause 14.9 of the GCC read with Clause 1.1.4.11 of PCC\nand Clauses 7.5, 7.6 and 2.5 of GCC concerning RMBGs create a threshold,\nthat before invocation of BGs, determination of amount due, must be made\nunder Clause 3.5 by an Engineer appointed under Clause 3 of the GCC. The\nsubmission is that in the present case no such determination has been made\nby the Engineer of the amounts due from the petitioner and thus it is not\nopen to respondent No. 1 to invoke the said BGs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">17.   The next contention of the learned senior counsels is that under\nClause 2.5 of the GCC, the employer is bound to give notice detailing the\nparticulars of its claims to the contractor. The particulars shall specify the\nbasis of the claim and shall include substantiation of the amount, which the\nemployer considers himself to be entitled in connection with the contract.\nClause 3.5 provides that the that the Engineer shall make a determination in\naccordance with the contract and obligates the Engineer to give the notice of\ndetermination to all parties along with supporting particulars. No such\nnotice under Clause 2.5 or 3.5 has been served upon the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">18.   The next contention is that the illegal termination of the agreement by\nrespondent no. 1 under Clause 15.2 of the Agreement even otherwise does\nnot entitle respondent no. 1 to invoke the BGs, inasmuch as the agreement\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 6 of 66</span>\n already stood terminated by the petitioner vide its letter dated 1.7.2019 and\nthe BGs were liable to be returned immediately thereafter. Clause 15.1\nprovides that if the contractor fails to carry out any obligation under the\nContract, the Engineer may by notice require the contractor to make good\nthe failure and to remedy it within a reasonable time. Clause 15.2 provides\nfor termination on certain grounds mentioned therein. One of the grounds\nentitling the employer to terminate under 15.2 is the failure of the contractor\nto comply with sub-clause 4.2 or with a notice to correct under sub-clause\n15.1 (notice to correct). It is submitted that neither has the petitioner failed\nto comply with sub-clause 4.2 nor any defect notice was issued by\nrespondent No. 1 under sub-Clause 15.1. The other grounds entitling the\nemployer to terminate the contract as mentioned in clauses (b) and (c) under\nClause 15.2 have also not arisen in the present case. The work was never\nabandoned by the petitioner and rather there is a breach on the part of\nrespondent no. 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">19.    It is next contended that Clause 4.2 of the GCC prohibits invocation\nof performance security except when the following events occur:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       (a) failure of the petitioner to extend the validity of the performance\nsecurity.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (b) failure of the petitioner to pay an amount due as agreed by the\ncontractor or determined under sub-clause 2.5 or Clause 20.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       (c) failure to remedy, a default within 42 days of receiving a notice to\nthat effect.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       (d) Circumstances entitling respondent no. 1 to terminate the contract\nunder Clause 15.2, irrespective, whether termination notice has been given\nor not.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                        Page 7 of 66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">       None of the events mentioned above have arisen against the petitioner\nand thus the BGs could not have been invoked by respondent No. 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">20.   Learned senior counsels contend that the same BGs had been invoked\nby letter dated 15.6.2019 and was challenged by the petitioner in OMP (I)\nCOMM 200/2019. The petitioner was successful in the said challenge and\nthis Court has restrained the encashment of the BGs. Between the earlier\njudgment and today the only intervening action by respondent no. 1 is the\nissuance of termination notice dated 15.7.2019. A bare perusal of the notice\nindicates that the grounds seeking termination are the same that existed prior\nto the judgment. There is no fresh or changed circumstance giving rise to\nany ground for fresh invocation. The grounds urged earlier by respondent\nno. 1 were: (a) Alleged deficiencies in the work carried out by the petitioner;\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">(b) Delay in completion of works. Perusal of the notice indicates that the\nsame grounds have been taken in the fresh notice to invoke the BGs. The\nsubmission therefore is that once these very grounds were tested in the\nearlier judgment and the action of the respondent no. 1 was found to be\nillegal being contrary to the contractual provisions, respondent no. 1 cannot\nbe permitted to again invoke the said BGs, without remedying the earlier\naction. Plea also is that the invocation on same grounds is barred by\nprinciples of Res-Judicata.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">21.   Learned senior counsels submit that in the earlier judgment the Court\ndid not enter into the dispute regarding the correctness of the quantum of the\nmonetary claim made by respondent no. 1. The Court examined the contract\nand its provisions and found that the various clauses of the agreement\nprovided certain procedures which had to be followed prior to invocation of\nBGs. The Court specifically observed that Clause 4.2 required two distinct\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 8 of 66</span>\n conditions to be met before invocation viz. (1) one of the events specified in\nClause 4.2 (a) to (d) has occurred and (2) such an event has resulted in\nrespondent no. 1 becoming entitled for payments under the Contract, which\nhave been determined by the Engineer after notice to the Contractor.\nAttention is drawn to paras 15, 16, 17, 24, 35 and 36 of the judgment. It is\nsubmitted that in para 35 of the judgment, this Court has expressly held that\nthere must be a determination by an Engineer preceeded by a notice with\nparticulars as per requirement of Clauses 4.2 read with Clauses 2.5 and 3.5.\nIt is further submitted that for this reason the Court in para 43 of the\njudgment categorically held that though respondent no. 1 has the liberty to\ninvoke the BGs afresh, but in such an eventuality procedure under Clause\n4.2 shall be satisfied. It is thus not open to respondent no. 1 to ignore the\nsaid judgment and invoke the BGs without satisfying the conditions of\nClause 4.2 read with Clauses 2.5 and 3.5. This judgment is binding on the\nparties and respondent no. 1 cannot reagitate the contentions which were\nrejected by the Court in the earlier round of litigation. The only way the\nrespondent no. 1 can now invoke the BGs is by first following the procedure\nwherein after giving notice to the parties of the amount due, if any,\ndetermination would be made by the Engineer and no short cut can be\nadopted. Added to this is the contention that respondent no. 1 was conscious\nof this limited window given by the Court and therefore premised its\ninvocation on purported compliance of the judgment, which is evident from\na plain reading of the letter of invocation dated 22.07.2019.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">22.   Learned senior counsels further submit that even assuming that the\ntermination notice amounts to a determination by the Engineer in terms of\nClause 3.5, it was admittedly not preceeded by any notice with particulars as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 9 of 66</span>\n required under Clause 2.5.      If, on the other hand, it is a notice with\nparticulars, then admittedly there is no determination under Clause 3.5.\nSurely, the notice dated 15.7.2019 cannot possibly satisfy both the\nrequirements of being a notice under Clause 2.5 and a determination under\nClause 3.5.     Thus, the invocation is in the teeth of Clause 4.2 and the\njudgment dated 3.9.2019.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">23.   Per contra, learned senior counsels for respondent no. 1 argued that\nthe contract in question was awarded to the petitioner for construction of a\nresidential project, way back on 7.2.2013. The scheduled date of completion\nwas 9.1.2016, but the petitioner abandoned the contract on 20.7.2019,\ndespite seeking several extensions from time to time.       Breaches by the\npetitioner have caused substantial financial loss to respondent no. 1, besides\ndamage to its reputation. Claims by several aggrieved flat owners under\nRERA have been made against respondent no. 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">24.   It is submitted that vide judgment dated 3.7.2019 this Court had\ngranted liberty to respondent no. 1 to invoke the PBG and RMBGs afresh\nand respondent no. 1 vide its termination notice dated 15.07.2019 has\ncomplied with the requirements of Clause 4.2 and determination has been\nmade. Since it is a fresh invocation, the present case needs to be decided\nuninfluenced by any observations or findings in the earlier judgment as\nobserved in the judgment itself. It is settled law that each successive\ninvocation gives a fresh cause of action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">25.   It is next contended that principles of Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">CPC</a> would govern the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a> of the Act.               Any\ndetermination under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 9</a> is only a prima facie adjudication and cannot\noperate as res judicata and would thus not bind subsequent proceedings. It\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 10 of 66</span>\n is vehemently argued that the law on restraint against invocation/encashment\nof unconditional BGs is more than settled.        The BGs in question are\nunconditional and do not incorporate the provisions of the Contract. Under\nthe terms of the BGs it is the sole discretion of respondent no. 1 as to when\nand under what circumstances they can be invoked and this is irrespective of\nany disputes under the main contract. The decision of respondent no. 1\nregarding any breach etc. and the amount demanded is final and binding on\nthe bank and the bank is not obliged to wait for any determination by the\nEngineer. Attention is drawn to the relevant Clauses of the PBG, which read\nas under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;1. Now, we the Guarantor, for the fulfillment of obligations of\n      the Contractor under the Contract do hereby irrevocably and\n      unconditionally agree and guarantee to immediately pay to the\n      Employer, the sum not exceeding the Guaranteed Amount,\n      without any demur, enquiry, protest or proof or satisfaction and\n      without reference to the Contractor, merely on receipt of first\n      written demand from the Employer stating that the amount is\n      due by reason of any default, breach, failure, non-performance,\n      delay or incapacity of/by the Contractor in relation to its\n      obligations, covenants, undertakings, representations and\n      warranties under the Contract. Any such demand made on the\n      Guarantor by the Employer shall be binding and conclusive as\n      regard the amount immediately due and payable by the\n      Guarantor under this Guarantee, without any demur.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      &quot;3. We, the Guarantor, absolutely and conclusively undertake\n      to pay to the Employer any money not exceeding the\n      Guaranteed Amount so demanded notwithstanding any dispute\n      or disputes raised by the Contractor, in any suit or proceeding\n      pending before any court or Tribunal relating thereto,\n      irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, modification,\n      regularity or enforceability of the Contract or the insolvency,\n      bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the Contractor or any\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                      Page 11 of 66</span>\n       other circumstances whatsoever which might otherwise\n      constitute a discharge or defence of a guarantor or a surety.\n      The Guarantor shall have no recourse against the Employer for\n      any payment made hereunder.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      &quot;5.

It is thus sought to be argued that the said provisions of the BGs will\ngovern the parties notwithstanding anything in the contract or any dispute\nbetween the parties, as BG is an independent contract, as held by catena of\njudgments. It is a fundamental principle of law that a case of invocation of\nBG must be decided without advertence to the contract.

It is argued that the petitioner&#x27;s reliance on various terms of the\ncontract is misconceived because BG is a separate contract and there is no\nnecessity or obligation for the bank to look into the provisions of the main\ncontract. The bank is obliged to honour the BG on its mere invocation by the\nemployer. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"90640571\" id=\"span_18\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/90640571/\" id=\"a_12\">Gujarat Maritime Board</a> (supra) the Apex Court\nwas dealing with a similar controversy where the appellant alleged that the\nrespondent had breached the conditions of the LOI and the cancellation was\nbad, the BG could not be invoked. The Apex Court held that the BG was a\nseparate contract. No doubt that in terms of the BG also, the invocation was\nagainst the breach of the conditions in the LOI, but between the bank and the\nappellant the decision of the appellant as to the breach is absolute and\nbinding.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7094\" id=\"span_19\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_13\">Mahatma Gandhi Sahakra Sakkare Karkhane</a>\n(supra) the Apex Court had laid down that a person in whose favour the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 13 of 66</span>\n Guarantee is furnished, cannot be prevented by an injunction in enforcing\nthe same on the ground that the conditions for enforcement as per the terms\nof the agreement are unfulfilled.

Conscious of this law the Court had in para 20 observed that\nthe bank cannot refuse to honour the Bank Guarantee on the ground that\nconditions of Clause 4.2 had not been satisfied by the petitioner and thus no\nrestraint order can be passed against the Bank.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"90640571\" id=\"span_21\">29.

Learned senior counsels vehemently contend that the public policy\ncontained in settled law against injunction on invocation of BGs is to repose\nfaith in commercial transactions.   Various judgments have highlighted the\nimportance of BGs in facilitating trade and commerce and the damage done\nin restraining their invocations. Reliance is placed on the judgments of the\nApex Court in State of Maharastra &amp; Anr. vs. National Construction Co.,\nBobay &amp; Anr. 1996 1 AD (SC) 458.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">36.   On the issue of compliance with para 43 of the judgment dated\n3.7.2019, learned senior counsels for respondent no.1 highlight that pursuant\nto the liberty granted by the said judgment a preliminary determination of an\namount of Rs.135.61 crores was made; Clause 15.2 of the agreement was\ninvoked and termination notice was issued on 15.07.2019.            It is only\nthereafter that respondent no. 1 invoked the BGs vide letter dated 22.7.2019.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 17 of 66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\"> The petitioner has never disputed that requirements of Clauses 4.2(c) and (d)\nhave been satisfied and the only contention is that procedure in Clauses 2.5\nand 3.5 had not been followed. It is pointed out that respondent no. 1 itself\nhas been named as the Engineer in the Appendix to the Tender and the Court\nhaving noticed the same observed that either a prior notice of claims by\nrespondent no. 1 or a determination as an Engineer was enough. Had the\nCourt intended that the notice was to be given and the determination was to\nbe done by the Engineer, the word used in para 35 would have been &#x27;and&#x27;\nnot &#x27;or&#x27;. Thus, having given a notice of claims, requirement of the judgment\nhas been met.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_43\">37.   It is further contended by the learned senior counsels that sub-clause\n3.5 requires the Engineer to make a fair determination but the respondent\nitself being an Engineer, any such determination would not be fair. Thus,\nthe said provision is not enforceable. The determination and notice by\nrespondent no.1, through its letter dated 15.7.2019 is sufficient compliance\nwith clause 4.2. Reliance is placed on the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_38\">State of Karnataka\nvs. Shree Rameshwara Rice Mills, Thirthahalli</a> (1987) 2 SCC 160.              It is\nfurther sought to be contended that keeping this in view the provisions\ncontained in the contract pertaining to determinations, certifications, etc. by\nthe Engineer have been done away with and the same is evident from the\nfact under clause 8.7 of the GCC, respondent no.1 has itself determined the\ndelayed damages without following procedure in clauses 2.5 and 3.5 and the\npetitioner never raised any objection to the same. Similarly, clause 3.2\nrequires the Engineer to nominate a primary nominee. No such nominee\nwas ever appointed and petitioner never raised any grievance.           Various\nother instances, under several clauses of the GCC have been pointed out\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                        Page 18 of 66</span>\n where respondent no.1 has taken action, instead of an &#x27;Engineer&#x27; and the\npetitioner acquiesced in each one of them.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">38.   It is submitted that without prejudice to the other contentions,\nrespondent No.1 has determined its claims due from the petitioner to the\ntune of at least Rs. 135.61 crores in the notice dated 15.07.2019 and this is\nclearly a determination as required under the contract. Whether or not, the\ndetermination is correct and whether the procedure envisaged under clause\n2.5 and 3.5 has been followed or not, is a dispute to be adjudicated by the\nArbitral Tribunal. This is a matter to be decided at final stage and not, at\nany interim stage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">39.   It is further contended that respondent no. 1 has invoked the BGs on\nthe basis of clause 4.2 (c) and (b) which operate independently from clauses\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">(a) and (b). The same are not subject to the procedure specified in clause\n2.5. Reasons for termination are mentioned in paragraphs 20 to 34 of the\nnotice, being delay of more than 3 years in completion of the work and non-\nrectification of the defects.     If the requirement of having the amount\ndetermined under clauses 2.5 and 3.5 was applicable to all sub-clauses of\nclause 4.2, there was no need to have incorporated sub-clauses (c) and (d) as\nClauses (a) and (b) would have sufficed for all eventualities. Thus, the\ninterpretation given by the petitioner would render sub-clauses (c) and (d)\notiose. Significantly sub clauses (c) and (d) do not refer to clause 2.5.\nWherever, therefore, the parties intended, the said contract makes a\nreference to clause 2.5, such as the indemnity clause. Since the invocation\nis in terms of clause 4.2 (c) and (d), the same is valid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131326253\" id=\"span_45\">40.   Attention of this Court is drawn to a judgment passed by the\ncoordinate Bench in OMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017 titled as <a href=\"/doc/131326253/\" id=\"a_39\">IVRCL Ltd. vs.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                      Page 19 of 66</span>\n Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. &amp; Ors.</a> 2017 decided on 22.12.2017, wherein the\nCourt has rejected a similar contention and held that while it may be true\nthat in terms of clause 2.5 the respondent may not have raised a separate\nclaim, but the right to encash the BG upon termination of the contract is a\nseparate right vested in the employer under clause 4.2 and 15.4 and the\nencashment cannot be injuncted.     Clearly, upon termination, clause 15.4\nGCC provides a discretion to the employer to either proceed in accordance\nwith clause 2.5 or recover from the contractor any losses and damages\nincurred by the employer.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">41.   The next contention is that even assuming for the sake of arguments\nthat clause 4.2 is applicable, the same would not apply to RMBGs. The\nrequirement to furnish RMBGs is in sub clause 1.1.4.11 of the Particular\nConditions of Contract (PCC). Under this there is no requirement to follow\nthe procedure in Clause 4.2 herein.     As per clause 14.9 of the GCC,\npetitioner can seek release of 50% retention money/ reduction by 50% upon\nissuance of taking over certificate and the remaining 50% upon expiry of the\ndefect period plus 30 days. The option of giving a BG in lieu of deduction\nof retention money from the Bills is a concession to the petitioner. In the\npresent case, the petitioner has failed to complete the work and is thus not\nentitled to the release of 50% of the RMBGs nor has the defect liability\nperiod expired.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">42.   Learned senior counsels for the petitioner, in the rejoinder reiterate\nthe contention that the judgment dated 3.7.2019 is binding between the\nparties. Without there being a notice and a determination by the Engineer of\nthe amounts payable by the petitioner, the invocation could not have been\ndone on 22.7.2019. It is submitted that the respondent no.1 is trying to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                     Page 20 of 66</span>\n justify its actions by stating that the earlier judgment is per incuriam and\nthat the judgment itself gave them the liberty for a fresh invocation.\nLearned senior counsel submits that this is a complete misreading of the\njudgment. The coordinate Bench has clearly given a finding that there were\nprohibitory covenants in the contract and any action to invoke the BG were\ncircumscribed by a prior action of determination under clause 3.5.           The\nCourt has clearly held that it is impermissible for respondent no.1 to invoke\nthe BGs without following the contractual procedure. Yet, respondent no. 1\nhas chosen to invoke the BGs on the same grounds without following the\nprocedure mandated under the contract and by this Court.                     The\nconsideration and reasoning of the Court is clearly reflected in paras 11 to\n12 and 19 to 25.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">43.   Learned senior counsels have argued that a bare reading of clause 2.5\nshows that if the employer considers himself entitled to any payment under\nany clause of these conditions or under the contract, it shall give a notice\nwith particulars. The Engineer shall then proceed in accordance with sub-\nclause 3.5 to determine the amount, if any, payable by the Contractor.\nClause 3.5 requires the procedure to be followed before a fair determination\nis made and that requires notice to both parties with supporting particulars.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">44.   Attention of this Court is drawn to various other clauses of the\nagreement in order to substantiate the argument that wherever the parties so\nenvisaged that clause 2.5 will apply, it has been so mentioned in the relevant\nclauses.    Clause 7.5 which relates to rejection also provides that if the\nrejection and retesting causes the employer to incur additional costs, the\ncontractor shall, subject to clause 2.5, pay these costs.       Similarly, the\nprocedure under clause 7.6 relating to remedial work is also subject to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                        Page 21 of 66</span>\n procedure under clause 2.5. Similar clauses like 8.6, 9.4, 11.3 and 11.4 have\nbeen brought to the notice of this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">45.   Learned senior counsels for the petitioner submit that after a notice of\ntermination under sub-clause 15.2, which relates to termination by the\ncontractor, has taken effect, the employer shall under Clause 16.4 of the\nGCC promptly return the performance security to the contractor. Since, the\npetitioner had terminated the contract by a notice dated 15.07.2019, the\nsecurity ought to have been returned and cannot be encashed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">46.   The petitioner next contends that by the judgment dated 03.07.2019,\nthe Court has rendered some important findings that PBG and RMBG have\nto be treated identically; circumstances under clause 4.2 have not arisen and\nthe Engineer has not determined any amount payable. It is submitted that\npara 24 of the judgment is very significant, where the Court has noted that\nrespondent No.1 had agreed not to invoke the BGs except in circumstances\nmentioned in clause 4.2 in the contract and, therefore, it cannot now rely on\nthe general principles of BGs to contend that no injunctions can be granted\neven though the invocation is in breach of the terms of the agreement. The\nCourt has held that to accept this would be to defeat <a href=\"/doc/1626651/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 42</a> of the\nSpecific Relief Act, 1963 and make the terms of the contract otiose. It is\nargued that in para 32 of the judgment, the Court has taken note of several\nclauses of the contract which are dependent on the determination by the\nEngineer under clause 2.5 and in para 35. There is a clear finding after\ninterpreting the said clauses that the first step would be the notice to the\ncontractor giving relevant particulars followed by the determination by the\nEngineer of the amount due.       The Court has categorically rejected the\nsubmission of the respondent that no determination is to be made by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 22 of 66</span>\n Engineer before invoking the BG in view of clause 4.2 of the agreement. In\nPara 36 of the judgment, the said principles have been made applicable to\ninvocation of the RMBGs as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">47.   Learned senior counsels for the petitioner submit that the stand of the\nrespondents has been self-contradictory as regards interpretation of para 43\nof the judgment dated 03.07.2019. In reply to the application under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n17</a> of the Act before the Arbitral Tribunal, the respondents have stated in\npara (s) that the respondents after complying with Clause 4.2 reinvoked the\nBGs on 23.7.2019.

Again\nin para (bb), it is averred that termination notice was issued on 15.7.2019\ndetermining the claims and thereby complying with provisions of para 4.2.\nIn contrast to this, a stand is being taken here that no determination is\nrequired under clause 4.2.

Between the\n      appellant therein and the first respondent, in the event of failure\n      to perform the obligations under the LOI the appellant was\n      entitled to cancel the LOI and invoke the Bank Guarantee.

The Apex Court held that between the Bank and the appellant, the\nmoment there was a written demand for invoking the BG pursuant to breach\nof the covenant between the appellant and the respondent, the bank was\nbound to honour the payment under the Guarantee. The Apex Court held\nthat the Bank Guarantee is a separate contract and is not qualified by the\ncontract or performance of the obligations. No doubt, in terms of the BG\nalso, the invocation is only against a breach of the conditions in the LOI, but\nbetween the appellant and the bank the decision of the appellant as to the\nbreach is absolute and binding on the Bank.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">63.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"636783\" id=\"span_80\">In <a href=\"/doc/636783/\" id=\"a_62\">Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Ltd.</a> (supra), the Apex Court has\ndeprecated the practice of the High Courts in granting injunctions restraining\nthe encashment of unconditional BGs and held that this would mean not\ncomplying with the law <a href=\"/doc/636783/\" id=\"a_63\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court and would amount of\njudicial impropriety. The Apex Court held that the High Court was not\njustified in invoking the principle of unjust enrichment and denying the\nappellant the right to encash the BG.

It is unfortunate that the High Court did not consider it\n      necessary to refer to various judicial pronouncements of this\n      Court in which the principles which have to be followed while\n      examining an application for grant of interim relief have been\n      clearly laid down. The observation of the High Court that\n      reference to judicial decisions will not be of much importance\n      was clearly a method adopted by it in avoiding to follow and\n      apply the law as <a href=\"/doc/636783/\" id=\"a_64\">laid down by</a> this Court. Yet another serious\n      error which was committed by the High Court, in the present\n      case, was not to examine the terms of the bank guarantee and\n      consider the letters of invocation which had been written by the\n      appellant. If the High Court had taken the trouble of examining\n      the documents on record, which had been referred to by the\n      trial court, in its order refusing to grant injunction, the court\n      would not have granted the interim injunction. We also do not\n      find any justification for the High Court in invoking the alleged\n      principle of unjust enrichment to the facts of the present case\n      and then deny the appellant the right to encash the bank\n      guarantee. If the High Court had taken the trouble to see the\n      law on the point it would have been clear that in encashment of\n      bank guarantee the applicability of the principle of undue\n      enrichment has no application.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">      32. When a position, in law, is well settled as a result of judicial\n      pronouncement of this Court, it would amount to judicial\n      impropriety to say the least, for the subordinate courts\n      including the High Courts to ignore the settled decisions and\n      then to pass a judicial order which is clearly contrary to the\n      settled legal position. Such judicial adventurism cannot be\n      permitted and we strongly deprecate the tendency of the\n      subordinate courts in not applying the settled principles and in\n      passing whimsical orders which necessarily has the effect of\n      granting wrongful and unwarranted relief to one of the parties.\n      It is time that this tendency stops.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_83\">64.

The question was about the\nenforcement of an irrevocable and unconditional BG, payable on demand\nwithout demur. The Apex Court held that the law relating to invocation of\nunconditional Bank Guarantees is well settled.         When in course of\ncommercial dealings an unconditional Bank Guarantee is given or accepted,\nthe beneficiary is entitled to realise the BG irrespective of any pending\ndispute.   The Bank is bound to honour it as per the terms of the BG\nirrespective of any dispute raised by its customer.

The Bank must pay according to the tenor of its\nguarantee, on demand, without proof or condition.</span>          The Apex Court\nsignificantly also held that a mere irretrievable harm or injury would not be\nenough to restrain the invocation of the BG and the threshold should be as\nhigh as was the kind envisaged in the case of Itek Corporation case (supra)\nwhere there was a war like situation and recovery was impossible. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_86\">To the\nsame effect is the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_67\">Vinitec Electronics\nPrivate Limited</a> (supra) more particularly paragraphs 11 and 12.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7094\" id=\"span_87\">65.

The Apex Court repelled the contention of\nthe seller that the purchaser could invoke the bank guarantee only on failure\nof the supplier to conduct the trial test and fulfil other obligations and held\nthat the argument that pending a dispute relating to the failure or breach of\none party, cannot be accepted as being a ground to restrain invocation. The\ndispute, if any, with regard to the liability in any Court of law will have no\nbearing on encashment of the BG. It was held that once the BG is\nunconditional and irrevocable, it is not open to the bank to raise any\nobjection whatsoever to pay the amounts under the Guarantee. The person in\nwhose favour the guarantee is furnished by the bank cannot be prevented by\nan injunction in enforcing the same on the ground that the condition for\nenforcing the BG in terms of the agreement has not been fulfilled. Such a\ncourse is impermissible. Relevant paras read as under;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">      18. A plain reading of Clauses (1) and (2) of the bank\n      guarantee makes it abundantly clear that the guarantor had\n      undertaken to pay to the appellant within 30 days of demand,\n      without demur such an amount not exceeding Rs 92.40 lakhs.\n      The sole discretion is conferred on the purchasers as to\n      whether the amount of bank guarantee has become recoverable\n      from the sellers or whether the sellers have committed any\n      breach of the terms and conditions of the said agreement. The\n      right of the purchaser to recover from the guarantor the\n      guaranteed amount shall not be affected or suspended by the\n      reasons of the fact that any dispute or disputes have been raised\n      by the sellers with regard to their liability or that the\n      proceedings are pending before any tribunal or court with\n      regard thereto or in connection therewith.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                        Page 40 of 66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">       19. However, Shri Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel\n      submitted that the purchasers were entitled to invoke the bank\n      guarantee and demand the payment of money only upon the\n      failure of the supplier to conduct the trial test of the sugar plant\n      by 24-7-2003 and also upon the failure of the sellers to\n      commission the project before December 2003. This condition\n      forms an integral part of the bank guarantee was the\n      submission. We find it difficult to accept the submission. The\n      guarantee executed by the guarantor (PNB) in favour of the\n      purchaser (the appellant) cannot be dissected in the manner\n      suggested by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent.\n      Clauses 1 and 2 of the guarantee executed by the banker in\n      favour of the purchaser are required to be read together. The\n      respondent cannot be allowed to contend that there is a dispute\n      as to whether it had failed to conduct the trial test of the sugar\n      plant by 24-7-2003 and therefore bank guarantee cannot be\n      invoked. The acceptance of the argument would make Clause 2\n      of the bank guarantee totally meaningless and inoperative. The\n      guarantor essentially agreed that the purchasers alone shall be\n      the sole judge in the matter as to whether the amount of bank\n      guarantee has become recoverable from the sellers or whether\n      the seller had committed any breach of the terms and\n      conditions of the agreement. The dispute, if any, between the\n      parties with regard to the liability in any proceedings either\n      before the Arbitral Tribunal or court in no manner affects the\n      right of the purchaser to invoke the bank guarantee and realise\n      the guaranteed sum from the guarantor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">      22. In our considered opinion if the bank guarantee furnished is\n      an unconditional and irrevocable one, it is not open to the bank\n      to raise any objection whatsoever to pay the amounts under the\n      guarantee. The person in whose favour the guarantee is\n      furnished by the bank cannot be prevented by way of an\n      injunction in enforcing the guarantee on the pretext that the\n      condition for enforcing the bank guarantee in terms of the\n      agreement entered between the parties has not been fulfilled.\n      Such a course is impermissible. The seller cannot raise the\n      dispute of whatsoever nature and prevent the purchaser from\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                         Page 41 of 66</span>\n       enforcing the bank guarantee by way of injunction except on\n      the ground of fraud and irretrievable injury.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"90640571\" id=\"span_91\">66.

We do not\n      think it necessary to burden this judgment by referring to all of\n      them. Some of the more recent pronouncements on this point\n      where the earlier decisions have been considered and\n      reiterated are <a href=\"/doc/325228/\" id=\"a_72\">Svenska Handelsbanken v.

State Sugar Corpn. [(1997) 1 SCC 568] as\n      follows: (SCC p. 574, para 12)\n\n      &quot;The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by\n      now well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings an\n      unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the\n      beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms\n      thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                      Page 42 of 66</span>\n       such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms\n      irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The very\n      purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be\n      defeated. The courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an\n      injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee.\n      The courts have carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in\n      connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very\n      foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there is such a\n      fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take the advantage, he\n      can be restrained from doing so. The second exception relates\n      to cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional\n      bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice\n      to one of the parties concerned. Since in most cases payment of\n      money under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the\n      bank and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is given,\n      the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of\n      such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override\n      the terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an\n      injunction on commercial dealings in the country.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">      Dealing with the question of fraud it has been held that fraud\n      has to be an established fraud. The following observations of\n      Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in Bolivinter Oil SA v. Chase\n      Manhattan Bank [(1984) 1 All ER 351, CA] are apposite:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">      &quot;... The wholly exceptional case where an injunction may be\n      granted is where it is proved that the bank knows that any\n      demand for payment already made or which may thereafter be\n      made will clearly be fraudulent. But the evidence must be clear,\n      both as to the fact of fraud and as to the bank&#x27;s knowledge. It\n      would certainly not normally be sufficient that this rests on the\n      uncorroborated statement of the customer, for irreparable\n      damage can be done to a bank&#x27;s credit in the relatively brief\n      time which must elapse between the granting of such an\n      injunction and an application by the bank to have it\n      discharged.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">                                                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_97\">(emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                      Page 43 of 66</span>\n       The aforesaid passage was approved and followed by this\n      Court in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_75\">U.P.

The second exception to the rule of granting injunction, i.e.,\n      the resulting of irretrievable injury, has to be such a\n      circumstance which would make it impossible for the guarantor\n      to reimburse himself, if he ultimately succeeds. This will have to\n      be decisively established and it must be proved to the\n      satisfaction of the court that there would be no possibility\n      whatsoever of the recovery of the amount from the beneficiary,\n      by way of restitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">      34. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_99\">In <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_76\">Vinitec Electronics Private Ltd. v. HCL Infosystems Ltd.</a>,\n      (2008) 1 SCC 544, the Supreme Court after relying upon\n      various earlier judgments of the Court reiterated that the\n      allegation with regard to the alleged breach of a contract by\n      the respondent is not a plea of fraud of a egregious nature so as\n      to vitiate the entire transaction. Paragraphs 24 to 28 of the\n      Judgment are quoted herein below:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">      &quot;24. The next question that falls for our consideration is as to\n      whether the present case falls under any of or both the\n      exceptions, namely, whether there is a clear fraud of which the\n      Bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it\n      seeks to benefit and another exception whether there are any\n      &quot;special equities&quot; in favour of granting injunction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      25. This Court in more than one decision took the view that\n      fraud, if any, must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate the\n      underlying transaction. We have meticulously examined the\n      pleadings in the present case in which no factual foundation is\n      laid in support of the allegation of fraud. There is not even a\n      proper allegation of any fraud as such and in fact the whole\n      case of the appellant centres around the allegation with regard\n      to the alleged breach of contract by the respondent. The plea of\n      fraud in the appellant&#x27;s own words is to the following effect:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 44 of 66</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">       &quot;That despite the respondent HCL being in default of not\n      making payment as stipulated in the bank guarantee, in\n      perpetration of abject dishonesty and fraud, the respondent\n      HCL fraudulently invoked the bank guarantee furnished by the\n      applicant and sought remittance of the sums under the\n      conditional bank guarantee from Oriental Bank of Commerce\n      vide letter of invocation dated 16-12-2003.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">      26. In our considered opinion such vague and indefinite\n      allegations made do not satisfy the requirement in law\n      constituting any fraud much less the fraud of an egregious\n      nature as to vitiate the entire transaction. The case, therefore\n      does not fall within the first exception.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">      27. Whether encashment of the bank guarantee would cause\n      any &quot;irretrievable injury&quot; or &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot;.

Unfortunately, the High Court went wrong both in its\n      analysis of facts and approach on law. A cursory reading of LoI\n      would clearly show that it is not a case of forfeiture of security\n      deposit &quot;... if the contract had frustrated on account of\n      impossibility...&quot; but invocation of the performance bank\n      guarantee. On law, the High Court ought to have noticed that\n      the bank guarantee is an independent contract between the\n      guarantor Bank and the guarantee appellant. The guarantee is\n      unconditional, no doubt, the performance guarantee is against\n      the breach by the lead promoter viz. the first respondent. But\n      between the bank and the appellant, the specific condition\n      incorporated in the bank guarantee is that the decision of the\n      appellant as to the breach is binding on the Bank. The\n      justifiability of the decision is a different matter between the\n      appellant and the first respondent and it is not for the High\n      Court in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n      India to go into that question since several disputed questions\n      of fact are involved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      xxxxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      11. It is contended on behalf of the first respondent that the\n      invocation of bank guarantee depends on the cancellation of the\n      contract and once the cancellation of the contract is not\n      justified, the invocation of bank guarantee also is not justified.\n      We are afraid that the contention cannot be appreciated. The\n      bank guarantee is a separate contract and is not qualified by\n      the contract on performance of the obligations. No doubt, in\n      terms of the bank guarantee also, the invocation is only against\n      a breach of the conditions in the LoI. But between the appellant\n      and the Bank, it has been stipulated that the decision of the\n      appellant as to the breach shall be absolute and binding on the\n      Bank.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      12.

On being satisfied that the first respondent\n      has failed to perform its obligations as covenanted, the\n      appellant cancelled the LoI and resultantly invoked the bank\n      guarantee.

As far as the submission of the petitioner that it was the\n      respondent no. 1 who was guilty of not handing over the\n      possession of the land and/or drawings and for other defaults\n      which had an adverse impact on completion of work within the\n      time stipulated, the same can be considered only by the Arbitral\n      Tribunal upon parties leading evidence before it. However, the\n      same would not be a relevant consideration for restraining the\n      respondent no. 1 from exercising its rights under the Bank\n      Guarantee(s) which is separate contract between the\n      respondent no. 1 and the bank. The Bank Guarantees are\n      unconditional in nature. Therefore, the invocation and\n      encashment thereof cannot be restrained on account of any\n      dispute relating to the Agreement between the petitioner and\n      respondent no. 1.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"4089628\" id=\"span_108\">69.   Traversing through the <a href=\"/doc/4089628/\" id=\"a_84\">judgments <a href=\"/doc/4089628/\" id=\"a_85\">referred to above</a></a>, it is crystal clear\nthat when an unconditional Bank Guarantee is furnished, the beneficiary has\na right to invoke the same de hors the inter se disputes between the\nbeneficiary and the party on whose behalf the Bank Guarantee was\nfurnished. The Bank Guarantee is an independent contract between the\nBank and the beneficiary.</span> It is equally well-settled that the Courts cannot\nand should not injunct the invocation or encashment of any unconditional\nand irrevocable BG except in the case of egregious fraud or irretrievable\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                        Page 49 of 66</span>\n injury of the highest threshold, as in the case of Itek Corporation (supra).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">70.   To decide the first issue the terms and conditions of BGs in the\npresent case need to be examined. There is no dispute between the parties\nthat the provisions of the RMBGs are the same as PBG, except for few\nminor changes. A perusal of the terms of the BGs leaves no manner of doubt\nthat the BGs are unconditional and the bank has given an unconditional\npromise to respondent No. 1 that it would without any demur, enquiry,\nprotest, proof or satisfaction, merely on receipt of the first written demand\nstating that the amount is due on account of default etc. of the contractor\nwould honour the Guarantee and pay to the employer. Significantly the\nterms also clearly incorporate that the payment would be made without any\nreference to the contractor and not withstanding any dispute raised by the\ncontractor in any suit or proceeding, before any Court of Law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">71.   As held by the Apex Court, the Bank Guarantee is clearly an\nindependent contract and has to be construed on its own terms. I find merit\nin the contention of Mr. Sethi, learned senior counsel that in view of the\nsettled law, unconditional BGs have to be honoured and restraint orders\nagainst their invocations cannot be passed by the Courts save and except in\nthe case of the two exceptions mentioned above. I also find merit in the\ncontention that the PBG and the RMBGs in the present case are clearly\nunconditional and irrevocable BGs. Thus, following the law laid down by\nthe Apex Court in several judgments no injunction can be issued by this\nCourt restraining the invocation/encashment of the BGs in question in this\npetition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">72.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1754916\" id=\"span_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"152816036\" id=\"span_111\">In view of the law settled by the Apex Court and the Division Bench\nof this Court, in my opinion, the judgments relied upon by the petitioner in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 50 of 66</span>\n the case of Simon Carves (supra), <a href=\"/doc/152816036/\" id=\"a_86\">Gangotri Enterprises Limited</a> (supra)\nand <a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_87\">Hindustan Construction Company</a> (supra) would be of no avail to the\npetitioner and are clearly distinguishable.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">73.   Mr. Sethi is also right in his contention that no case of alleged fraud\nor irretrievable injury has even been pleaded or set up by the petitioner in\nthe present case. In the present case thus, this Court need not concern itself\nwith the two exceptions carved out to the law of unconditional BGs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">74.   BGs are unconditional and their invocation/encashment cannot be\nrestrained. Hence, the first issue is decided in favour of respondent No. 1\nand against the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_110\">75.   The argument of the petitioner on the second issue is in two parts.\nThe first argument is that clause 4.2 of the Agreement between the parties\npermits invocation of the BGs only when a determination has been made by\nthe Engineer and it is ascertained as to what is payable to the respondent and\nthat the said determination is preceded by a notice. The second part of the\nargument focuses on the findings and observations in the judgment dated\n03.07.2019, between the parties and to sum up, the contention is that vide\n<a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_88\">the said judgment</a> this Court has already held that before invocation of the\nBGs determination must be made under clause 4.2 read with clauses 2.5 and\n3.5. The judgment being inter-party is binding on the parties and the only\nway the respondent can succeed in invoking the BGs is by first determining\nthe amount due.      Since there has been no such determination by the\nEngineer preceded by notice, the invocation is in the teeth of <a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_89\">the said\njudgment</a>. Coupled with this is an equally emphatic contention that the\njudgment being one of a Coordinate Bench is binding on this Court and thus\nthis Court is bound to take the same view and restrain respondent no. 1 from\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 51 of 66</span>\n invoking the BGs. It is argued that the invocation letter is against the liberty\ngiven in para 43 of the judgment, which was the only limited window\navailable to respondent No. 1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">76.   I have carefully examined the said contention of the petitioner as well\nas the counter submissions of respondent No. 1. The issue that this Court\nneeds to decide is whether the judgment dated 03.07.2019 has a binding\neffect on this Court. The contention of the respondent no.1 is that where a\nCourt is faced with two conflicting judgments, one by a Coordinate Bench\nand second by a Bench of larger strength or the Apex Court, it has to follow\nthe latter. It is only when there is no judgment of the higher Forum and the\ncoordinate Bench has rendered a judgment on the said issue that the matter\nneeds to be referred to a larger Bench, if the Second Bench disagrees with\nthe view taken in the earlier judgment by the Coordinate Bench.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">77.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1108032\" id=\"span_114\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1108032/\" id=\"a_90\">Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre</a> (supra), the Apex\nCourt was dealing with the same contention.

Mr Jethmalani fairly submitted that the practice of passing\n      orders of anticipatory bail operative for a few days and\n      directing the accused to surrender before the Magistrate and\n      apply for regular bail are contrary to the law <a href=\"/doc/1108032/\" id=\"a_91\">laid down\n      in</a> Sibbia case [(1980) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 465] . <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1780466\" id=\"span_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"772627\" id=\"span_116\">The\n      decisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/772627/\" id=\"a_92\">Salauddin Abdulsamad\n      Shaikh v.

The Apex Court, examining the said issue, held that not only the\njudgment of a larger strength is binding on a judgment of smaller strength\nbut judgment of a co-equal strength is also binding on a Bench of co-equal\nstrength.   However, if the judgment rendered by a Bench of co-equal\nstrength is in ignorance of judgment of a Constitution Bench or a larger\nBench, then the said judgment is per incuriam.

The analysis of English and Indian law clearly leads to\n      the irresistible conclusion that not only the judgment of a larger\n      strength is binding on a judgment of smaller strength but the\n      judgment of a coequal strength is also binding on a Bench of\n      Judges of coequal strength. In the instant case, judgments\n      mentioned in paras 124 and 125 are by two or three Judges of\n      this Court. These judgments have clearly ignored the\n      Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Sibbia\n      case [(1980) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 465] which has\n      comprehensively dealt with all the facets of anticipatory bail\n      enumerated under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 438</a> CrPC.

The legal position which can be summarized would be\n      that a bank guarantee is an independent contract between the\n      bank and the beneficiary and disputes pertaining to bank\n      guarantees have to be resolved de-hors the terms of the main\n      contract between the parties or disputes relatable to the main\n      contract between the parties. Where a bank guarantee is a\n      conditional guarantee invocation thereof would have to be in\n      strict conformity with the conditions on which the guarantee is\n      issued. In such a case an injunction can be granted against\n      payment under the bank guarantee was issued has not been\n      complied with or met. But where the guarantee is conditional\n      and /or the bank has agreed to make payment without demur or\n      protest, on the beneficiary invoking the bank guarantee the\n      bank is obliged to honour the same for the reason like letters of\n      credit, a bank if not honoured would cause irreparable damage\n      to the trust in commerce and would deprive vital oxygen to the\n      money supply and money flow in commerce and transaction\n      which is necessary for economic growth. Disputes pertaining\n      to the main contract cannot be considered by a Court when a\n      claim under a bank guarantee is made and the Court would be\n      precluded from embarking on an enquiry pertaining to the\n      prima facie nature of the respective claim of the litigating\n      parties relatable to the main dispute. The dispute between the\n      parties to the underlying contract has to be decided at the civil\n      forum i.e. a civil suit if there exists no arbitration clause in the\n      contract or before the arbitral tribunal if there exists an\n      arbitration clause in the contract. Pendency of arbitration\n      proceedings is no consideration while deciding on the issue of\n      grant of an interim injunction. That certain amounts have been\n      recovered under running bills and have to be adjusted for is of\n      no concern in matters relating to invocation of bank guarantee.\n      That there are serious disputes on questions as to who\n      committed the breach of the contract are no circumstances\n      justifying granting an injunction pertaining to a bank\n      guarantee.

It is thus clear that this Court while deciding the question of\nencashment of BGs will not concern itself with the interpretation or breach\nor compliance of the clauses of the contract and therefore, the issue as to\nwhether the procedure <a href=\"/doc/158014472/\" id=\"a_112\">laid down in</a> clause 4.2 read with clauses 2.5 and 3.5\nhas been followed by respondent no.1 or not, is beyond the domain of this\nCourt, while deciding a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 9</a> of the Act, relating to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 234/2019                                       Page 57 of 66</span>\n restraint against an unconditional BGs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">85.   I may at this stage refer to para 43 of the judgement dated 03.07.2019\non which much has been argued by both the sides. Relevant para reads as\nunder:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">      &quot;43. As the encashment of the Bank Guarantees except for the\n      Advance Money Bank Guarantee, for which separate directions\n      have been passed in the present order, has been restrained only\n      on the ground that the respondent no. 1 has, prima facie, not\n      established the pre-conditions mentioned in Sub-Clause 4.2 of\n      the Agreement, this order shall not prejudice the respondent no.\n      1 from invoking the Bank Guarantees in accordance with Sub-\n      Clause 4.2 of the Agreement.

Rather, respondent\nNo. 1 was given liberty to invoke the BGs again. This is fortified by the\nobservation that nothing in the judgment will effect the re-invocation. In so\nfar as the direction to comply with clause 4.2 is concerned, the law as laid\ndown the Apex Court will apply. This Court cannot enter into the\ninterpretation and provisions of the terms of the contract while deciding the\ndispute with respect to BGs. Thus, in my view, para 43 of the said\njudgement cannot help the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_123\">86.

Learned senior counsel has also argued that the mandate of the Court\nin the earlier judgment was to comply with clause 4.2 which has several sub-\nclauses i.e. 4.2(a) and 4.2(d). It was sought to be argued that the invocation\nis in accordance with the terms of clauses (c) and (d) and therefore, it is\nwrong to contend that clause 4.2 has not been complied with. In my view,\nthe question of compliance of the procedure in clause 4.2 or any other clause\nof the contract would be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal and has no\nrelevance for the present petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">88.      One of the arguments of the petitioner was that the judgment dated\n03.07.2019 has been passed in proceedings between the same parties and\nconstitutes res judicata. This argument is legally flawed for two reasons.\nFirstly, the Coordinate Bench in para 43 of the judgment has itself permitted\nthe respondent to invoke the BG and it is evident that by giving the said\nliberty, the Court never intended that the judgment would finally decide the\nright of respondent No. 1 to invoke the BGs in future. Moreover, there can\nbe no res judicata on the question of law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7094\" id=\"span_134\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_114\">Bharti Tele-\nVentures Ltd.</a> (supra), a Coordinate Bench of this Court has clearly held so.\nIn fact, the Court has held that between the same parties at successive stages\nof the same proceeding, the Court is not bound to decide a lis in violation of\nlaw merely because some error of law has been committed in the earlier\njudgment which has attained finality.

Res Judicata is, thus, a doctrine of fundamental importance\n      in our legal system, though it is stated to belong to the realm of\n      procedural law, being statutorily embodied in <a href=\"/doc/121631892/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 11</a> of the\n      Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. However, it is not a mere\n      technical doctrine, but it is fundamental in our legal system that\n      there be an end to all litigation, this being the public policy of\n      Indian law. The obverse side of this doctrine is that, when\n      applicable, if it is not given full effect to, an abuse of process of\n      the Court takes place. However, there are certain notable\n      exceptions to the application of the doctrine. One well known\n      exception is that the doctrine cannot impart finality to an\n      erroneous decision on the jurisdiction of a Court. Likewise, an\n      erroneous judgment on a question of law, which sanctions\n      something that is illegal, also cannot be allowed to operate as\n      res judicata....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">             xxx                          xxx                              xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      33.

This follows\n      from a reading of <a href=\"/doc/121631892/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 11</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure\n      itself, for the Court which decides the suit has to be a Court\n      competent to try such suit...\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">      ...(ii) An issue of law which arises between the same parties in\n      a subsequent suit or proceeding is not res judicata if, by an\n      erroneous decision given on a statutory prohibition in the\n      former suit or proceeding, the statutory prohibition is not given\n      effect to. This is despite the fact that the matter in issue between\n      the parties may be the same as that directly and substantially in\n      issue in the previous suit or proceeding. This is for the reason\n      that in such cases, the rights of the parties are not the only\n      matter for consideration (as is the case of an erroneous\n      interpretation of a statute inter parties), as the public policy\n      contained in the statutory prohibition cannot be set at naught.\n      This is for the same reason as that contained in matters which\n      pertain to issues of law that raise jurisdictional questions...\n      ...(iii) Another exception to this general rule follows from the\n      matter in issue being an issue of law different from that in the\n      previous suit or proceeding. This can happen when the issue of\n      law in the second suit or proceeding is based on different facts\n      from the matter directly and substantially in issue in the first\n      suit or proceeding. Equally, where the law is altered by a\n      competent authority since the earlier decision, the matter in\n      issue in the subsequent suit or proceeding is 49 not the same as\n      in the previous suit or proceeding, because the law to be\n      interpreted is different.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">90.   It is pertinent at this stage to notice that even in the judgment of\n03.07.2019, so heavily being relied upon by the petitioner, the Coordinate\nBench while noticing the various judgments on the issue of BGs, clearly\nheld that a BG is a separate and independent contract between the Bank and\nrespondent No. 1 and is to be governed by its own terms.

It was further held that as far as the\nBank is concerned, it cannot refuse to honour the invocation on the ground\nthat conditions set up in clause 4.2 have not been satisfied.

The parties, therefore, by way of the above clause have\n      themselves restricted the right of respondent no.1 to make a\n      claim against the Bank Guarantees. It may be true that a Bank\n      Guarantee is a separate and independent contract between the\n      respondent no.1 and the bank and is to be governed by its own\n      terms. As has been explained by the Supreme Court in the above\n      referred judgments, as far as the bank is concerned, if the Bank\n      Guarantee is unconditional, it cannot refuse to enforce the\n      invocation thereof for an underlining dispute between the two\n      contracting parties as this would not be any of its concern.\n      Invocation of such unconditional Bank Guarantees can be\n      restrained only on the limited exceptions of &quot;fraud&quot; and\n      &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot; as explained by the Supreme Court in\n      its various judgments, including the one mentioned\n      hereinabove, or where such invocation is not in terms of the\n      Bank Guarante.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">      17. However, having said the above, the two contracting parties\n      in the Contract between them this regard have agreed to restrict\n      the right of respondent no.1 to invoke the Bank Guarantees only\n      in the events mentioned in Sub-Clause 4.2 and for the amounts\n      to which respondent no.1 is entitled to under the Agreement.\n      The petitioner by way of the present petition seeks to enforce\n      this contractual term by way of an injunction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">      18.

The Agreement then\n      safeguards the petitioner from otherwise unfettered right of the\n      beneficiary/respondent no. 1 to invoke the Bank Guarantees, by\n      circumscribing/restricting the right of respondent no.1 to invoke\n      such Bank Guarantees only on existence of certain\n      circumstances. The respondent no.1 having obtained the Bank\n      Guarantees with such restrictions, cannot then rely upon the\n      general law applicable to such Bank Guarantees and wish away\n      the contractual limitations to its rights.

But the net\n      effect of the injunction is to restrain the bank from performing\n      the bank guarantee. That cannot be done. One cannot do\n      indirectly what one is not free to do directly. But a maltreated\n      man in such circumstances is not remediless.

In this case,\n      there cannot be any basis for apprehension that irretrievable\n      damages would be caused if any.
