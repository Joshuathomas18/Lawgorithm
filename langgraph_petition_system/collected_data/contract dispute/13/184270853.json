Relevant\n                      portion of Clause 25 of the said Agreement is\n                      as follows:-\n                                 &quot; The arbitration shall be conducted\n                               in accordance with provisions of the\n                               <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_9\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n                               1996</a> (26 of 1996) or any statutory\n                               modification or re-enactment thereof\n                               and the rules made there under and\n                               for the time being in force shall\n                               apply to the arbitration proceeding\n                               under the clause.&quot;\n                        (5)     The scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_11\">9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1986891/\" id=\"a_12\">22</a> of\n                      the State shows that in the absence of an\n                      agreement stipulating the applicability of the\n                      Central Act, the State Act applies to works\n                      contracts. Since in the present cases, an\n                      arbitration agreement exists and stipulates\n                      applicability of the Central Act, the State Act\n                      will not apply.

It is in view of the aforesaid judgment rendered by\n\n         the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of M/S Brahmaputra\n\n         Infrastructure Ltd. (supra), that the arbitral Tribunal has\n\n         refused to adjudicate the reference case filed by the petitioner\n\n         herein, hence, left with no other efficacious remedy, the\n\n         petitioner has approached this Court for review of the earlier\n\n         order dated 04.10.2018 passed by this Court and for appointing\n\n         an independent Arbitrator for adjudicating the disputes between\n\n         the parties, arising out of the agreement in question.\n\n         Nonetheless, the learned Senior Counsel Sri Y.V. Giri , appearing\n\n         for the petitioner has simultaneously canvassed before this\n\n         Court that the State Arbitral Tribunal is fully competent to\n\n         adjudicates the dispute arising in between the petitioner and the\n\n         State Government, emanating from the agreement in question\n\n         entered into between them. In this regard, the learned counsel\n\n         for the petitioner has relied upon two judgments rendered by the\n\n         Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, which are being discussed herein below.\n\n                      4. The first judgment is the one rendered by the\n\n         Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Madhya Pradesh Rural\n\n         Road Development Authority &amp; Anr. vs. L.G. Chaudhary\n\n         Engineers and Contractor, reported in (2012) 3 SCC 495. In\n\n         the said judgment there has been some divergence of views,\n Patna High Court C. REV. No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            7/27\n\n\n\n\n         hence both the views are being reproduced herein below,\n\n         paragraphs no. 25 to 28, 37, 38, 39, 41 and 42 being the view\n\n         expressed by Hon&#x27;ble A.K. Ganguly, J. and paragraphs no. 53,\n\n         54, 55 and 58 being the view expressed by Hon&#x27;ble Mrs. Gyan\n\n         Sudha Mishra, J.:-\n\n                       &quot;25. In para 28 of the judgment, this Court while\n                      referring to the provisions of the M.P. Act held:\n                      (Anshuman Shukla case5, SCC pp. 497-98)\n                           &quot;28. The provisions of the Act referred to\n                       hereinbefore clearly postulate that the State of\n                       Madhya Pradesh has created a separate forum\n                       for the purpose of determination of disputes\n                       arising inter alia out of the works contract. The\n                       Tribunal is not one which can be said to be a\n                       domestic tribunal. The Members of the Tribunal\n                       are not nominated by the parties. The disputants\n                       do not have any control over their appointment.\n                       The Tribunal may reject a reference at the\n                       threshold. It has the power to summon records.\n                       It has the power to record evidence. Its functions\n                       are not limited to one Bench. The Chairman of\n                       the Tribunal can refer the disputes to another\n                       Bench. Its decision is final. It can award costs. It\n                       can award interests. The finality of the decision\n                       is fortified by a legal fiction created by making\n                       an award a decree of a civil court. It is\n                       executable as a decree of a civil court. The\n                       award of the Arbitral Tribunal is not subject to\n                       the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_13\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> and\n                       the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_14\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>. The\n                       provisions of the said Acts have no application.&quot;\n                            26. It is clear, therefore, that in view of the\n                        aforesaid finding of a coordinate Bench of this\n                        Court on the distinct features of an Arbitral\n                        Tribunal under the said M.P. Act in Anshuman\n                        Shukla case5 the provisions of the M.P.

No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            8/27\n\n\n\n\n                         in Va Tech1 has not either noticed the previous\n                         decision of the coordinate Bench of this Court\n                         in Anshuman Shukla5 or the provisions of\n                         <a href=\"/doc/72836326/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 2(4)</a> of the AC Act, 1996. Therefore,\n                         we are constrained to hold that the decision of\n                         this Court in Va Tech1 was rendered per\n                         incuriam.\n                            27. This was the only point argued before\n                         us by the learned counsel for the appellant.\n                            28. The principle of per incuriam has been\n                         very succinctly formulated by the Court of\n                         Appeal in Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co.\n                         Ltd.6 Lord Greene, Master of Rolls\n                         formulated the principles on the basis of\n                         which a decision can be said to have been\n                         rendered &quot;per incuriam&quot;. The principles are:\n                         (KB p. 729)\n                                 &quot;... Where the court has construed a\n                             statute or a rule having the force of a\n                             statute its decision stands on the same\n                             footing as any other decision on a\n                             question of law, but where the court is\n                             satisfied that an earlier decision was\n                             given in ignorance of the terms of a\n                             statute or a rule having the force of a\n                             statute the position is very different. It\n                             cannot, in our opinion, be right to say\n                             that in such a case the court is entitled\n                             to disregard the statutory provision and\n                             is bound to follow a decision of its own\n                             given when that provision was not\n                             present to its mind. Cases of this\n                             description are examples of decisions\n                             given per incuriam.&quot;\n\n                        37. The said argument cannot be accepted. The\n                    provision for repeal under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 85</a> of the AC\n                    Act, 1996 does not show that there is any express\n                    repeal of the M.P. Act. Apart from that, the\n                    provision of <a href=\"/doc/145770481/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 2(4)</a> of the AC Act clearly\n                    militates against the aforesaid submissions.\n                     38. The argument of repugnancy is also not\n                     tenable. Entry 13 of the Concurrent List in the\n Patna High Court C. REV. No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            9/27\n\n\n\n\n                     Seventh Schedule of the Constitution runs as\n                     follows:\n                            &quot;13. Civil procedure, including all\n                        matters included in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_19\">the Code of Civil\n                        Procedure</a> at the commencement of this\n                        Constitution, limitation and arbitration.&quot;\n                      In view of the aforesaid entry, the State\n                      Government is competent to enact laws in\n                      relation to arbitration.\n\n                          39. The M.P. Act of 1983 was made when\n                       the previous <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_20\">Arbitration Act</a> of 1940 was in\n                       the field. <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_21\">That Act</a> of 1940 was a Central law.\n                       Both the Acts operated in view of <a href=\"/doc/144997/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 46</a>\n                       of the 1940 Act. The M.P. Act, 1983 was\n                       reserved for the assent of the President and\n                       admittedly received the same on 17-10-1983\n                       which was published in the Madhya Pradesh\n                       Gazette Extraordinary dated 12-10-1983.\n                       Therefore, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 254(2)</a>\n                       of the Constitution was satisfied. Thus, the\n                       M.P. Act of 1983 prevails in the State of\n                       Madhya Pradesh. Thereafter, the AC Act,\n                       1996 was enacted by Parliament repealing\n                       the earlier laws of arbitration of 1940. It has\n                       also been noted that the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_24\">AC Act, 1996</a> saves\n                       the provisions of the M.P. Act, 1983 under\n                       <a href=\"/doc/1450090/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 2(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1271430/\" id=\"a_26\">2(5)</a> thereof. Therefore,\n                       there cannot be any repugnancy.\n                     41. It is clear from the aforesaid observations\n                     that in the instant case the latter Act made by\n                     Parliament i.e. the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_27\">AC Act, 1996</a> clearly\n                     showed an intention to the effect that the State\n                     law of arbitration i.e. the M.P. Act should\n                     operate in the State of Madhya Pradesh in\n                     respect of certain specified types of arbitrations\n                     which are under the M.P. Act, 1983. This is\n                     clear from <a href=\"/doc/72836326/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 2(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/546849/\" id=\"a_29\">2(5)</a> of the AC\n                     Act, 1996. Therefore, there is no substance in\n                     the argument of repugnancy and is accordingly\n                     rejected.\n                      42. Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the\n                      judgment of the High Court which is based\n Patna High Court C. REV. No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            10/27\n\n\n\n\n                      on the reasoning of Va Tech2 is set aside.\n                      This Court holds that the decision in Va\n                      Tech1 has been rendered per incuriam. In\n                      that view of the matter the arbitration\n                      proceeding may proceed under the M.P. Act\n                      of 1983 and not under the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_30\">AC Act, 1996</a>.\n\n                       53. In order to clarify the point further, what\n                      needs to be emphasised is that if the nature\n                      of dispute referred to the arbitrator like the\n                      instant matter, related to a dispute pertaining\n                      to construction, repair, maintenance of any\n                      building or superstructure, dam or for the\n                      reasons stated within the definition of\n                      &quot;works contract&quot;, the matter may be referred\n                      to the M.P. Tribunal in view of the fact that if\n                      there is a dispute in relation to execution of a\n                      works contract, then irrespective of the fact\n                      whether the agreement contains an\n                      arbitration clause or not, the dispute is\n                      required to be referred to the M.P. State\n                      Arbitration Tribunal for adjudication. But\n                      when the contract itself has been terminated,\n                      cancelled or repudiated as it has happened in\n                      the instant case, then the nature of dispute\n                      does not fall within the definition of &quot;works\n                      contract&quot; for the sole reason that it does not\n                      include any dispute pertaining to cancellation\n                      of a works contract implying that when the\n                      works contract itself is not in existence by\n                      virtue of its cancellation, the dispute cannot\n                      be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration\n                      Tribunal but may have to be decided by an\n                      arbitrator appointed under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_31\">Arbitration\n                      and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.\n                       54. Hence, if the nature of the dispute is\n                      such which falls within the definition of\n                      &quot;works contract&quot; under Section 2(i) of the\n                      M.P. Act, 1983 and one of the contracting\n                      parties to the agreement is the State of M.P.,\n                      then irrespective of an arbitration agreement\n                      the dispute will have to be referred to the\n                      Tribunal in terms of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 7</a> of the Act of\n Patna High Court C. REV. No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            11/27\n\n\n\n\n                      1983. But if the works contract itself has\n                      been repudiated and hence not in existence at\n                      all by virtue of its cancellation/termination,\n                      then in my considered view, the dispute will\n                      have to be referred to an independent\n                      arbitrator to be appointed under the\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_33\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> since\n                      the M.P. Act, 1983 envisages reference of a\n                      dispute to the State Tribunal only in respect\n                      of certain specified types of arbitration\n                      enumerated under Section 2(i) of the M.P.\n                      Act, 1983.\n                       55. As a consequence and fallout of the\n                     aforesaid discussion, the impugned order of\n                     the High Court by which the dispute relating\n                     to termination of works contract by the M.P.\n                     Rural Road Development Authority itself was\n                     referred to an independent arbitrator appointed\n                     by the High Court under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_34\">Arbitration and\n                     Conciliation Act, 1996</a> needs to be sustained\n                     and there is no need for a de novo reference of\n                     the dispute to the M.P. State Arbitration\n                     Tribunal. In the alternative, the consequence\n                     would have been otherwise and the matter\n                     could have been referred to the State\n                     Arbitration Tribunal if the dispute between the\n                     parties related to any dispute emerging out of\n                     execution of works contract which could fall\n                     within the definition of &quot;works contract&quot; given\n                     out within the definition of &quot;works contract&quot;\n                     under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Act of 1983.\n                      58. Thus, while holding that the M.P. Act,\n                      1983 should operate in the State of M.P. in\n                      respect of certain specified types of\n                      arbitration, the appointment of an\n                      independent arbitrator by the High Court\n                      under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_35\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n                      1996</a> needs to be sustained since the works\n                      contract itself is not in existence by virtue of\n                      its cancellation and hence this part of the\n                      dispute could not have been referred to the\n                      M.P. State Tribunal.&quot;\n\n               5.        By referring to the aforesaid judgment rendered in\n Patna High Court C. REV. No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            12/27\n\n\n\n\n         the case of        L.G.

Madhyastham\n\n         Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 and the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court,\n\n         by virtue of the aforesaid judgment rendered in the case of L.G.\n\n         Chaudhary Engineers and Contractor (supra) has held that\n\n         the State Government is competent to enact laws in relation to\n\n         arbitration and the disputes can very well be referred to the State\n\n         Arbitration Tribunal, if the disputes between the parties relate to\n\n         any dispute emerging out of execution of works contract which\n\n         could fall within the definition of &quot;works contract&quot;, as defined\n\n         in the M.P. Madhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983 and the\n\n         said Adhiniyam, 1983 would not be hit by the principles of\n\n         repugnancy despite the existence of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_38\">Arbitration and Conciliation\n\n         Act, 1996</a>.\n\n                      6.     On account of two separate judgments being\n\n         rendered by the two Members of the Division Bench and there\n\n         being some divergence of view in the aforesaid judgments\n\n         rendered in the case of L.G. Chaudhary Engineers and\n\n         Contractors (supra), the matter was directed to be placed\n Patna High Court C. REV. No.20 of 2019 dt.09-05-2019\n                                            13/27\n\n\n\n\n         before the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice of India for constituting a\n\n         larger Bench to resolve the divergence whereupon the matter\n\n         was placed before the larger Bench to resolve the divergence,\n\n         which had then delivered its own judgments, reported in (2018)\n\n         2 SCC 826 at 833.\n\n                      7. The larger Bench by a judgment dated 8.3.2018\n\n         reported in (2018) 10 SCC 826 at 833 has held that the view\n\n         expressed by Hon&#x27;ble A.K.

It has\n\n         also been held that M.P.

The\n                      respondent raised an objection that in view of\n                      VA Tech Escher Wyass Flovel Ltd. v.

The\n                      respondent preferred a writ petition.

The learned counsel for the State has\n                      drawn our attention to Section 2(4) of the\n                      Central Act, which ios as follows:-\n Patna High Court C. REV.

This\n                      Court held: (FIR p 1293, para 24).\n                        &quot;24.... <a href=\"/doc/144997/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 46</a> makes the provisions of\n                      any other enactment or any rules made\n                      thereunder to prevail over the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_47\">Arbitration Act</a>,\n                      if inconsistent with the latter. In viw of these\n                      several provisions, it is clear that the\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_48\">Arbitration Act</a> applies to all Arbitrations and\n                      Chaper II makes it applicable also to\n                      arbitrations,      in     which   the   arbitration\n                      agreement is asked to be filed in Court under\n                      <a href=\"/doc/385194/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 20</a> subject, however, to this that the\n                      provisions of any other enactment or rules\n                      made thereunder, if inconsistent with the\n                      <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_50\">Arbitration Act</a>, are to prevail.\n                        14. In view of the above, we are of the view\n                      that the State law will prevail in terms of\n Patna High Court C. REV.

The appeal is accordingly, allowed\n                      in above terms.\n                        37.
