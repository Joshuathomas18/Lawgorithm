The case of the Appellants, as pressed by Mr. Navaniti PD Singh and\n                             Mr. Dayan Krishnan, learned senior counsels appearing on behalf of the\n                             Appellants, is that a perusal of the record shows that it is on account of the\n                             default on part of the Respondents that the Appellant could not achieve the\n                             milestones required to be completed under the EPC contract. Attention of\n                             this Court has been drawn to the fact that Respondent No. 1 failed to provide\n                             Right of Way in terms of Clauses 8.1 and 8.2 of the EPC contract by not\n                             being able to procure the requisite permissions and clearances from the Tree\n                             Officer to fell trees.

Reliance has been placed on letters dated 28.05.2022\n                             and 23.07.2022 to buttress this submission. It is also alleged that the\n                             complete site has not been handed over by the Respondents to Appellant and\n                             requests in this regard had been made by the Appellant vide letters dated\n                             19.11.2021 and 03.12.2021 but to no avail. Further submissions have been\n                             made to the effect that it was the Respondents themselves which had issued\n                             a Stop Work Order on 07.04.2022 to halt construction work until permission\n                             from Tree Officer had been received and the Respondents have conveniently\n                             ignored this fact while attributing the delay on part of the Appellants. The\n                             sum and substance of the Appellantsâ€Ÿ case, therefore, is that it is ipso facto\n                             discernible that conduct of the Respondents is the reason behind the delay in\n                             completion of the project and their termination of the EPC contract is\n                             outrightly arbitrary.

We have already concluded that PPA is not a\n                                            statutory contract. However, that would not be the end\n                                            of enquiry. Dr A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel,\n                                            would point out that the contract, not being a statutory\n                                            contract, assumes relevance only for the purpose of\n                                            deciding as to whether the Court should relegate the\n                                            writ applicant, to alternate remedies. In other words,\n                                            while the Court would retain its discretion to entertain\n                                            the petition or decline to do so, in the facts of each\n                                            case, there is no absolute taboo against the Court\n                                            granting relief, even if the challenge to the termination\n                                            of a contract is made in the case of a contract, which is\n                                            not statutory in nature, when the offending party is the\n                                            State. In other words, the contention is that the law in\n                                            this field has witnessed an evolution and, what is more,\n                                            a revolution of sorts and a transformatory change with\n                                            a growing realisation of the true ambit of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 14</a> of\n                                            the Constitution of India.

In a case the State is a party to the contract and\n                                            a breach of a contract is alleged against the State, a\n                                            civil action in the appropriate forum is, undoubtedly,\n                                            maintainable.

However,\n                                            it must be made clear that every case involving breach\n                                            of contract by the State, cannot be dressed up and\n                                            disguised as a case of arbitrary State action. While the\n                                            concept of an arbitrary action or inaction cannot be\n                                            cribbed or confined to any immutable mantra, and\n                                            must be laid bare, with reference to the facts of each\n                                            case, it cannot be a mere allegation of breach of\n                                            contract that would suffice. What must be involved in\n                                            the case must be action/inaction, which must be\n                                            palpably unreasonable or absolutely irrational and\n                                            bereft of any principle. An action, which is completely\n                                            mala fide, can hardly be described as a fair action and\n                                            may, depending on the facts, amount to arbitrary\n                                            action.
