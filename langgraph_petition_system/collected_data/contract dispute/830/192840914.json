The plaintiff submitted its bid for the\n\n    said work and by a Letter of Acceptance dated 17th October, 2020 and\n\n    the bid of the plaintiff was accepted.

Admittedly, the Memorandum is not the part of the contract. Both\n\n    Learned Senior Advocates relied upon the judgment in the case of\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/77286517/\" id=\"a_24\">National Highways Authority of India</a> (Supra).          Mr. Gupta relied\n\n    upon paragraphs 26 and 27 of the said report which reads as follows:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                      13</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      &quot;26. We now turn to the reasoning given by\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in paras 21 to 23 of the\naward, as quoted above. The award considers the\nimpact of sub-clauses 70.1 to 70.7 and agrees with\nthe contention that the provision for cost escalation\nbased on the agreed price adjustment formulae\nfalls in one compartment while the compensation\nfor additional cost resulting from a subsequent\nlegislation falls in a separate category. In other\nwords, the contention that stands accepted was,\nthat the escalation in price premised on fluctuation\nin market value of the inputs stands on one footing,\nwhile the additional cost resulting from the impact\nof any statute, decree, ordinance, law, etc. as\nreferred to in Clause 70.8 stands on the other.\nResultantly, the governing clauses in the instant\ncase were held not to be sub-clauses 70.1 to 70.7\nbut the substantive part of Clause 70.8. The award\nalso considered whether minor minerals in question\nwere or were not included in the basket of\nmaterials whose cost variation was taken into\naccount as an input while arriving at WPI. It also\nconsidered that WPI is an index applicable\nuniformly in all States while the increase in\nseigniorage fee would vary from State to State. It\nfurther dealt with the aspect that NHAI itself was\nof the opinion that the additional impact as a result\nof    subsequent     legislation   was    admissible\nseparately, as signified by the Letter dated 3-9-\n2003 to the Economic Advisor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      27. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77286517\" id=\"span_23\">In the backdrop of the law <a href=\"/doc/77286517/\" id=\"a_25\">laid down by</a>\nthis Court, the construction of the terms of the\ncontract by the Arbitral Tribunal is completely\nconsistent with the principles <a href=\"/doc/77286517/\" id=\"a_26\">laid down by</a> this\nCourt. Upon construing the terms and the material\non record it concluded that the instant matter\nwould be covered by substantive part of Clause\n70.8 of COPA. It also noted that NHAI itself was of\nsuch opinion. The view so taken by the Arbitral\nTribunal after considering the material on record\nand the terms of the contract is certainly a possible\nview, to say the least. We do not see any reason to\ninterfere. The Division Bench in our considered\nview, was completely right and justified in\ndismissing the challenge.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                 14</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">Mr. Mitra relied upon paragraphs 39 to 42 which read as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                &quot;39. The disputes between the parties were\n           referred to the Arbitral Tribunal. We are concerned\n           in the present appeal with Claim 8 which was for\n           refund of royalty on ordinary earth amounting to\n           Rs. 70,65,039 which was claimed on the ground\n           that it was covered by Clause 70.8 COPA. It was\n           observed by the Arbitral Tribunal that after the\n           commencement of the 1957 Act it was not within\n           the powers of the U.P. State Government to have\n           framed the U.P. State Rules of 1963 and\n           consequently such Rules were not binding on the\n           contractor. In its view, the imposition of royalty by\n           the Government of U.P. vide Notification dated 20-\n           3-2001, being after the Central Government&#x27;s\n           Notification dated 3-2-2000, for the first time\n           validly created a liability to pay royalty. Any levy\n           and collection prior to 3-2-2000 was without any\n           legal sanction and therefore liable to be\n           disregarded and since the liability was validly\n           created after the contract was entered into, the\n           matter was covered under Clause 70.8 of COPA.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                40. The award dated 9-1-2012 thus accepted\n           Claim 8 in its entirety. This award was challenged\n           by the appellant by filing OMP No. 480 of 2012 in\n           the High Court of Delhi, which was dismissed by a\n           Single Judge of the High Court vide his order dated\n           18-5-2012. The matter was carried in appeal by\n           the appellant by filing FAO (OS) No. 302 of 2012\n           before the Division Bench which was dismissed\n           vide judgment and order dated 13-2-2013. While\n           granting special leave to appeal this Court confined\n           the matter to claim 8 alone and directed the\n           appellant to furnish bank guarantee in the sum of\n           Rs. 70,65,039/-. The bank guarantee was\n           accordingly furnished and is kept alive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                41. In support of the appeal, Ms Indu\n           Malhotra, learned Senior Advocate submitted that\n           the royalty, at the time the contract was entered\n           into, was payable @ Rs 4% and the Notification\n           dated 20-3-2001 of the Government of U.P.\n           maintained the same rate. The reasoning that prior\n           to 3-2-2000 the State Government lacked\n           competence and as such valid impact occurred for\n           the first time vide Notification dated 20-3-2001, in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                      15</span>\n\n\n               her submission was flawed and beyond the scope\n               of the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. On the\n               other hand, it was submitted by the respondent\n               that a demand letter from the District Collector was\n               without the support of law and that the impost\n               pursuant to the Notification of 20-3-2001 alone was\n               valid and legal and as such it being after the\n               contract was entered into, must qualify to be\n               &quot;subsequent legislation&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">                     42. The question, therefore, is whether Claim\n               8 is covered by Clause 70.8 of COPA. In Clause\n               13.4 of the invitation to tender it was clearly\n               stipulated in the contract that all duties, taxes and\n               other levies payable by the contractor under the\n               contract as of the date 28 days prior to the\n               deadline for submission of bid shall be included in\n               the rates and prices and the total bid price\n               submitted by the bidder. The State Government, as\n               a matter of fact, was levying royalty on ordinary\n               earth and this situation was obtaining on such\n               date. If the State Government lacked power to levy\n               and collect such royalty prior to the Notification\n               dated 3-2-2000 whereby ordinary earth was\n               brought under the definition of minor mineral, such\n               ground may certainly entitle a party to lay requisite\n               challenge before an appropriate forum. However,\n               for the purposes of the contract such levy being an\n               existing levy must be deemed to have been part of\n               the rates or prices quoted. By the Notification dated\n               20-3-2001, the same rate was maintained and as\n               such there was no change arising due to any\n               subsequent legislation. In our view the matter was\n               therefore completely outside the scope of Clause\n               70.8 of COPA. The Arbitral Tribunal ought to have\n               confined itself to the terms of the contract and see if\n               there was any variation for the purposes of Clause\n               70.8 of COPA. It went beyond its powers in holding\n               that the existing levy as on the date the contract\n               was entered into was without any authority in law\n               and as such the imposition by Notification dated\n               20-3-2001 created liability for the first time.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">29. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"171806715\" id=\"span_26\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/171806715/\" id=\"a_27\">SAL Udyog Private Limited</a> (Supra), the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n    Supreme Court held that:</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                       16</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      &quot;23. On a conspectus of the facts of the case,\nit remains undisputed that though the appellant\nState did raise an objection before the Arbitral\nTribunal on the claim of the respondent Company\nseeking deduction of supervision charges, for which\nit relied on Clause 6(b) of the agreement and the\nCircular dated 27-7-1987 to assert that recovery of\nsupervision charges along with expenses was a\npart and parcel of the contract executed with the\nrespondent Company, the said objection was\nturned down by the learned sole arbitrator by\ngiving a complete go-by to the terms and conditions\nof the agreement governing the parties and\nobserving that there is no basis to admit any such\n&quot;indirect expenses&quot;. The Circular dated 27-7-1987\nissued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh that\nprovides for imposition of 10% supervision charges\non the amounts calculated towards the cost of the\nSal seeds in the expenditure incurred, was also\nignored. Pertinently, the respondent Company has\nnot denied the fact that supervision charges were\nbeing levied by the appellant State and being paid\nby it without any demur as a part of the advance\npayment made on an annual basis, right from the\ndate the parties had entered into the first\nagreement i.e. from 30-8-1979. This fact is also\nborne out from the specimen copies of the orders\nfiled by the appellant State with the appeal that\namply demonstrate that the cost of the Sal seeds\nrequired to be paid by the respondent Company\nincluded &quot;supervision charges&quot; described as\n&quot;Paryavekshan vyay&quot; in vernacular language. It\nwas only after the appellant State had terminated\nthe second contract on 21-12-1998, that the\nrespondent Company raised a dispute and for the\nfirst time, claimed refund of the excess amount\npurportedly paid by it to the appellant State\ntowards supervision charges incurred for supply of\nSal seeds. In our opinion, this is the patent\nillegality that is manifest on the face of the arbitral\naward inasmuch as the express terms and\nconditions of the agreement governing the parties\nas also the Circular dated 27-7-1987 issued by the\nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh have been\ncompletely ignored.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">    26. To sum up, existence of Clause 6(b) in the\nagreement governing the parties, has not been\ndisputed, nor has the application of the Circular\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                      17</span>\n\n\n                dated 27-7-1987 issued by the Government of\n                Madhya Pradesh regarding imposition of 10%\n                supervision charges and adding the same to cost of\n                the Sal seeds, after deducting the actual\n                expenditure been questioned by the respondent\n                Company. We are, therefore, of the view that\n                failure on the part of the learned sole arbitrator to\n                decide in accordance with the terms of the contract\n                governing the parties, would certainly attract the\n                &quot;patent illegality ground&quot;, as the said oversight\n                amounts to gross contravention of <a href=\"/doc/1943211/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 28(3)</a> of\n                the 1996 Act, that enjoins the Arbitral Tribunal to\n                take into account the terms of the contract while\n                making an award. The said &quot;patent illegality&quot; is\n                not only apparent on the face of the award, it goes\n                to the very root of the matter and deserves\n                interference.

Jurisdiction of the Bombay High\n                     Court to entertain a suit under its ordinary\n                     original civil jurisdiction is determined by\n                     Clause 12 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay\n                     High Court. Under Clause 12 of the Letters\n                     Patent, a place where the defendant, or each\n                     of the defendants where there are more than\n                     one, at the commencement of the suit, carry on\n                     business would be a place where the Court\n                     would have jurisdiction.

From the foregoing decisions it can be\n                reasonably deduced that where such an ouster\n                clause occurs, it is pertinent to see whether there is\n                ouster of jurisdiction of other courts. When the\n                clause is clear, unambiguous and specific accepted\n                notions of contract would bind the parties and\n                unless the absence of ad idem can be shown, the\n                other courts should avoid exercising jurisdiction. As\n                regards construction of the ouster clause when\n                words like &#x27;alone&#x27;, &#x27;only&#x27;, &#x27;exclusive&#x27; and the like\n                have been used there may be no difficulty.

What is an appropriate case shall\n                depend on the facts of the case. In such a case\n                mention of one thing may imply exclusion of\n                another. When certain jurisdiction is specified in a\n                contract an intention to exclude all others from its\n                operation may in such cases be inferred. It has\n                therefore to be properly construed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1548537\" id=\"span_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"997135\" id=\"span_38\">39. <a href=\"/doc/997135/\" id=\"a_40\">A.B.C.
