SPML claims that the execution of the project was hampered for\n                         reasons attributable to NTPC. Nonetheless, SPML completed the\n                         project on 18.12.2015 and accordingly, was granted a completion\n                         certificate. It is SPML&#x27;s case that even after issuance of the completion\n                         certificate, NTPC failed and neglected to release the Bank Guarantees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                         7.

Final payment\n                         amounting to a sum of ₹ 1,40,00,000/- was released by NTPC towards\n                         SPML in April 2019. However, despite repeated reminders, NTPC did\n                         not release the Bank Guarantees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">                         8.     By an e-mail dated 14.05.2019, NTPC informed SPML that the\n                         Bank Guarantees were being withheld on the pretext that some\n                         liabilities and/or arbitral disputes were pending between the parties in\n                         respect of other projects at other sites.

SPML nominated Justice (Retd.)\n                         Dr Satish Chandra, a former judge of the High Court of Indore, to\n                         adjudicate the disputes between the parties and requested NTPC to\n                         nominate another arbitrator.

On 21.12.2019, SPML withdrew its arbitration notice subject to\n                         release of the Bank Guarantees by NTPC by 20.01.2020. SPML claims\n                         that during the pendency of the Writ Petition before this court, NTPC\n                         proposed a Settlement Agreement to SPML and took a position that the\n                         Bank Guarantees would not be released until SPML signs the\n                         Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement was signed on\n                         22.05.2020 and in pursuance of the same, NTPC released the Bank\n                         Guarantees although the same had expired earlier. The same was\n                         acknowledged by SPML in its letter dated 22.07.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">                         16.    Consequently, the aforesaid Writ Petition filed by SPML before\n                         this Court was also withdrawn on 21.09.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">                         17.    SPML in its letter dated 22.07.2020, stated that it was compelled\n                         to sign the Settlement Agreement under duress and without free\n                         consent. SPML further repudiated the said Agreement. SPML further\n                         requested NTPC to accept its claims as set out in the letter dated\n                         15.05.2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">                         18.    NTPC responded to the said letter dated 22.07.2020 disputing\n                         SPML&#x27;s claim of ₹72,01,53,899/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                         Submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                         19.    Mr Raman Kapoor, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n                         petitioner contended that there is no dispute as to the existence of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

He submitted that pre-arbitral steps as\n                         envisaged under the GCC of the Contract Agreement has been resorted\n                         to before taking recourse to arbitration. He submitted that in terms of\n                         the letter dated 12.06.2019, the petitioner had requested the respondent\n                         to appoint an Adjudicator as per Clause 6.1.3. of the GCC read with\n                         Clause 3 of the SCC. He submitted that as per the minutes of the\n                         meeting dated 08.11.2019 it is evident that both parties had come\n                         together and thus, the first pre-arbitral step of &#x27;mutual consultation&#x27; has\n                         been taken recourse to. He also submitted that the settlement of dispute\n                         scheme as envisaged under the Contract Agreement does not\n                         contemplate any recourse to conciliation and thus, cannot be settled by\n                         the Expert Settlement Council (ESC) as sought by the respondent. He\n                         submitted that the same is untenable as first, the ESC has been internally\n                         devised by the respondent and does not fall within the scope of Clause\n                         6 of the GCC; and second, that the ESC came into existence after the\n                         award of the Contract Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                         20.    Next, he submitted that the Settlement Agreement dated\n                         27.05.2020 is not a valid document as it was signed under economic\n                         duress and coercion. He submitted that the Bank Guarantees had been\n                         withheld by NTPC for several years even after due completion of the\n                         project on account of purported claims in another project. He stated that\n                         SPML signed the Settlement Agreement under duress as it was\n                         conditional upon release of the Bank Guarantees. He also submitted that\n                         SPML was strongarmed by NTPC to sign the Settlement Agreement as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

Mr Aman Lekhi, learned ASG appearing for NTPC contended\n                         that the present petition is premature as the petitioner has failed to take\n                         the mandatory pre-arbitral steps. He submitted that in terms of Clause\n                         6 of the GCC of the Contract Agreement the parties must, reach an\n                         amicable settlement by mutual consultation and incase, the same is not\n                         possible, then the disputes are to be referred to an adjudicator and, the\n                         decision of the adjudicator becomes final if neither party invoke the\n                         arbitration clause within fifty-six days from the date of passing of the\n                         award. He stated that NTPC on several occasions had communicated to\n                         SPML to amicably resolve the disputes and had also advised to refer the\n                         dispute to the ESC wherein, an adjudicator would have been appointed\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

However, SPML chose not to refer the\n                         disputes to the adjudicator rather, to execute a Settlement Agreement\n                         instead. He submitted that the arbitration clause must be construed\n                         strictly and it is essential for the partis to observe all pre-arbitral steps\n                         prior to the invocation of the arbitration clause. He relied upon the\n                         decisions of the Supreme Court in Oriental Company Insurance Ltd.\n                         v. M/s Narbheram Power and Steel Pvt.

He submitted that SPML completed the project on 18.01.2015\n                         and thereafter, a completion certificate was duly awarded to SPML. A\n                         final payment amounting to ₹ 1,40,00,000/- was also released in favour\n                         of SPML, which was followed by a No-Demand Certificate released by\n                         SPML towards NTPC. He submitted that NTPC had no ill intention to\n                         withhold the Bank Guarantees and the same were being withheld due to\n                         an outstanding amount recoverable from SPML which was arising out\n                         of several allied contractual obligations between the parties. He\n                         contended that subsequently a Settlement Agreement dated 27.05.2020\n                         was entered into between the parties with their free will and consent and\n                         the same was also executed under the supervision of this court and thus,\n                         is not a case of accord and satisfaction. It is alleged that SPML had\n                         undertaken to not initiate any further proceedings arising out of the\n                         Contract Agreement and over and above that, had also acted upon the\n                         Settlement Agreement as it accordingly, enjoyed the release of the Bank\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

Further, it is submitted that the issue of novation/supersession is\n                         not a preliminary issue and is beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator\n                         under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 16</a> of the A&amp;C Act as the Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 16</a> of\n                         the A&amp;C Act is not empowered to decide upon any issue if the\n                         appointment of the learned Arbitrator itself is on the basis of an\n                         arbitration clause which has become void along with the original\n                         contract. He submitted that the Settlement Agreement entered into\n                         between the parties supersedes the Contract Agreement, which stood\n                         terminated on completion of the project and since, the Contract\n                         Agreement has now lost its validity, the arbitration clause, being a\n                         component part of the agreement, falls with it.

The principal controversy that requires to be addressed by this\n                         Court relates to the scope of examination under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 11</a> of the A&amp;C\n                         Act at a pre-referral stage.     According to NTPC, the Settlement\n                         Agreement entered into by the parties novated the Contract Agreement.\n                         With the said novation, the Arbitration Clause contained in the Contract\n                         Agreement perished and since the Settlement Agreement does not\n                         include an Arbitration Clause, the parties cannot be referred to\n                         arbitration.       According to NTPC, the Arbitration Agreement as\n                         embodied in the Arbitration Clause under the Contract Agreement has\n                         ceased to exist. The said contention is disputed by SPML. According\n                         to SPML, the Settlement Agreement is invalid as it has been induced by\n                         economic coercion and undue influence. It is contended on behalf of\n                         SPML that there is no dispute that the parties had entered into a Contract\n                         Agreement and therefore, an Agreement to refer the disputes arising in\n                         relation thereto exists between the parties.

As the contract\n                                  subsists for certain purposes, the arbitration clause\n                                  operates in respect of these purposes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">                         32.

From what I have earlier said\n                                  about the terms of the settlement of February 22, 1949,\n                                  it is manifest that it settled the disputes between the\n                                  parties concerning the breach of the contract for kettles\n                                  camp and its consequences. All that it said was that the\n                                  contract had been broken causing damage and the claim\n                                  to the damages was to be satisfied &quot;in terms of the\n                                  settlement&quot;. It did not purport to annihilate the contract\n                                  or the arbitration clause in it. I feel no doubt therefore\n                                  that the arbitration clause subsisted and the arbitrator\n                                  was competent to arbitrate.

As I have earlier\n                                  stated it postulates the existence of the contract and only\n                                  decides the incidence of its breach.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">                                  33. It remains now to express my views on the question\n                                  whether the settlement of February 22, 1949, amounted\n                                  to an accord and satisfaction. I have earlier stated that an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

This release is purchased\n                                  by an agreement which is the accord. But this agreement\n                                  like all other agreements must be supported by\n                                  consideration. The satisfaction is that consideration. It\n                                  was formerly thought that the consideration had to be\n                                  executed.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">                         33.    There is no dispute that in the event a contract is novated by the\n                         parties entering into another contract, the rights and obligations of the\n                         parties would be covered by the new contract and not the one that has\n                         been novated. However, the present case is not one where the\n                         Settlement Agreement has substituted the Contract Agreement. It is\n                         essentially to record the agreement between the parties to settle their\n                         differences and disputes that have arisen in relation to performance and\n                         discharge of the Contract Agreement. Therefore, this Court has to\n                         examine the controversy arising in the present petition in the context of\n                         the dispute whether SPML had been compelled to enter into the\n                         Settlement Agreement by economic coercion and undue influence. The\n                         question whether there has been a valid novation of the Contract\n                         Agreement is itself a subject of dispute. The principal question before\n                         this court at this stage is whether the said dispute is required to be\n                         examined by the Arbitral Tribunal or by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">                         34.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"72573735\" id=\"span_78\">In <a href=\"/doc/72573735/\" id=\"a_19\">ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Limited v.

The contractee, after a gap of one month, that\n                                  is, on 24-10-2012, withdrew the no-dues certificate on the\n                                  grounds of coercion and duress and the claim for losses\n                                  incurred during execution of the contract site was made\n                                  vide letter dated 12-1-2013 i.e. after a gap of 3½ (three-\n                                  and-a-half) months whereas the final bill was settled on\n                                  10-10-2012. When the contractee accepted the final\n                                  payment in full and final satisfaction of all its claims,\n                                  there is no point in raising the claim for losses incurred\n                                  during the execution of the contract at a belated stage\n                                  which creates an iota of doubt as to why such claim was\n                                  not settled at the time of submitting final bills that too in\n                                  the absence of exercising duress or coercion on the\n                                  contractee by the appellant contractor.

Sub-section (4) deals with\n                                  the existence of an appointment procedure and the failure\n                                  of a party to appoint the arbitrator within 30 days from the\n                                  receipt of a request to do so from the other party or when\n                                  the two appointed arbitrators fail to agree on the presiding\n                                  arbitrator within 30 days of their appointment.

It is difficult to understand\n                                  the finality referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1181933/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 11(7)</a> as excluding the\n                                  decision on his competence and the locus standi of the\n                                  party which seeks to invoke his jurisdiction to appoint an\n                                  arbitrator. Viewed from that angle, the decision on all\n                                  these aspects rendered by the Chief Justice would attain\n                                  finality and it is obvious that the decision on these aspects\n                                  could be taken only after notice to the parties and after\n                                  hearing them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                                  39.

Obviously, he has to decide\n                                  his own jurisdiction in the sense whether the party making\n                                  the motion has approached the right High Court. He has\n                                  to decide whether there is an arbitration agreement, as\n                                  defined in the Act and whether the person who has made\n                                  the request before him, is a party to such an agreement. It\n                                  is necessary to indicate that he can also decide the\n                                  question whether the claim was a dead one; or a long-\n                                  barred claim that was sought to be resurrected and\n                                  whether the parties have concluded the transaction by\n                                  recording satisfaction of their mutual rights and\n                                  obligations or by receiving the final payment without\n                                  objection. It may not be possible at that stage, to decide\n                                  whether a live claim made, is one which comes within the\n                                  purview of the arbitration clause. It will be appropriate to\n                                  leave that question to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal\n                                  on taking evidence, along with the merits of the claims\n                                  involved in the arbitration.

The Indian judicial system is grossly\n                                        afflicted with frivolous litigation. Ways and means\n                                        need to be evolved to deter litigants from their\n                                        compulsive obsession towards senseless and ill-\n                                        considered claims. One needs to keep in mind that\n                                        in the process of litigation, there is an innocent\n                                        sufferer on the other side of every irresponsible and\n                                        senseless claim. He suffers long-drawn anxious\n                                        periods of nervousness and restlessness, whilst the\n                                        litigation is pending without any fault on his part.\n                                        He pays for the litigation from out of his savings\n                                        (or out of his borrowings) worrying that the other\n                                        side may trick him into defeat for no fault of his.\n                                        He spends invaluable time briefing counsel and\n                                        preparing them for his claim. Time which he\n                                        should have spent at work, or with his family, is\n                                        lost, for no fault of his. Should a litigant not be\n                                        compensated for what he has lost for no fault? The\n                                        suggestion to the legislature is that a litigant who\n                                        has succeeded must be compensated by the one\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

Judged by the aforesaid tests, it is obvious that whether\n                                the MoU has been novated by the SHA dated 12.04.1996\n                                requires a detailed consideration of the clauses of the two\n                                Agreements, together with the surrounding circumstances\n                                in which these Agreements were entered into, and a full\n                                consideration of the law on the subject.

It is relevant to bear in mind the aforesaid note of caution struck\n                         by the Supreme Court: a detailed examination as to the disputes by this\n                         Court would undoubtedly prejudice one or the other party. In the\n                         aforesaid context, it is clear that once it is apparent that the parties had\n                         entered into an agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration, the dispute\n                         whether the same has been discharged by a settlement is required to be\n                         liberally construed in favour of relegating the parties to arbitration.\n                         Unless the Court comes to the conclusion that the dispute raised by the\n                         claimant with regard to the validity of the settlement is bereft of any\n                         merit; is not bona fide; or is a frivolous one, the Court must relegate the\n                         parties to resolve the disputes in arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">                         55.    It is also relevant to bear in mind that the decision whether to\n                         refer the parties to arbitration is concerned with only the forum where\n                         the disputes are required to be agitated. In case where the Courts finds\n                         that the arbitration agreement does not exists, the parties would\n                         nonetheless be entitled to agitate the disputes before Civil Courts. In\n                         this perspective, once it is established that the parties had entered into\n                         an arbitration agreement, the Courts must lean in favour of relegating\n                         the parties to that forum. Once it established that the parties had entered\n                         into an Arbitration Agreement, the question whether the contract\n                         (including the arbitration clause) stood discharged by accord and\n                         satisfaction must be considered with the perspective whether the same\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_250\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

Thus, unless\n                         the Courts concludes that the said disputes are ex facie unmerited and\n                         frivolous, the parties must have their say before the agreed forum.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">                         56.    Bearing the aforesaid principles in mind, the Court may briefly\n                         examine the disputes between the parties. According to NTPC, the\n                         parties had voluntarily by free consent entered into a Settlement\n                         Agreement and thereby discharged the Contract Agreement. SPML\n                         claims that the Settlement Agreement was not voluntary but it was\n                         compelled to execute the same as NTPC had most unjustifiably\n                         withheld the release of the bank guarantees even though the Contract\n                         Agreement stood fully performed by SPML.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">                         57.    There appears to be no dispute that the Contract Agreement was\n                         performed. According to NTPC, it had issued the necessary certificates\n                         and had also tendered payment of ₹1,40,00,000/- which SPML had\n                         accepted. Nonetheless, NTPC had not released the Bank Guarantees.\n                         SPML had filed a Writ Petition before this Court seeking release of the\n                         Bank Guarantees. Although it had secured an interim order restraining\n                         NTPC from invoking the Bank Guarantees, SPML continued to run the\n                         risk that the proceedings may be protracted. In the meanwhile, the non-\n                         fund based facilities granted to SPML continued to be blocked.\n                         Undeniably, the same would have constrained SPML in its business.\n                         The question whether the said constraint was sufficient to compel\n                         SPML to accede to NTPC&#x27;s demand would be a matter for SPML to\n                         establish before the forum adjudicating the said dispute.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">Digitally Signed         ARB.

The communication dated 08.11.2019 refers to the Minutes of the\n                         Meeting held on that date between the representatives of SPML and\n                         NTPC. The Minutes of the Meeting indicates that NTPC had withheld\n                         the Bank Guarantees pending recoveries in respect of works executed\n                         by SPML on NTPC Bongaigon. NTPC had proposed that, if SPML\n                         withdraws the notice for arbitration, NTPC Simhadri will propose to the\n                         higher management to expedite release of the bank guarantees. SPML\n                         on the other hand had requested NTPC to make an additional payment\n                         of ₹1,37,24,411/- on account of (a) revocation of the liquidated\n                         damages of ₹86,19,871/-; (b) payment of additional works amounting\n                         to ₹35,92,200/-; and (c) payment for alleging wrongful deduction\n                         amounting to ₹15,12,340/-. It was NTPC&#x27;s stand that the contract\n                         closure process had been concluded and the only pending issue was\n                         release of the Bank Guarantees, and therefore, no further payments\n                         could be made.

It is apparent from the above that SPML had indicated that it was\n                         facing financial constraints on account of NTPC withholding the Bank\n                         Guarantees. NTPC on the other hand does not appear to have provided\n                         any substantial grounds for withholding the same.              It however,\n                         continued to persist with SPML that it would release the Bank\n                         Guarantees if SPML withdraws the disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">                         66.     SPML had invoked the arbitration clause and had sought\n                         reference of disputes to arbitration. It had also approached this court.\n                         Thus, it would be difficult for SPML to establish that it was\n                         economically coerced to enter into the Settlement Agreement.\n                         However, this Court is unable to accept that the dispute whether the\n                         Contract Agreement stood discharged/novated in terms of the\n                         Settlement Agreement, is ex facie untenable, insubstantial or frivolous.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">                         67.

By a letter dated 15.05.2019, SPML had called upon NTPC to\n                         pay an amount of ₹72,01,53,898/- against its claims within the period\n                         of fifteen days. Since the said demand was not met, SPML had by its\n                         letter dated 12.06.2019 requested the Chairman cum Managing Director\n                         of NTPC to appoint an adjudicator within thirty days in terms of Clause\n                         6.1.3 of GCC. It is <a href=\"/doc/107257333/\" id=\"a_164\">SPML</a>&#x27;s case that since an adjudicator was not\n                         appointed, SPML invoked the Arbitration Clause and by its letter dated\n                         23.07.2019, it nominated its arbitrator and called upon NTPC to\n                         nominate an arbitrator so that an Arbitral Tribunal could be constituted.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">                         69.    NTPC responded to the said letter on 29.08.2019 suggesting that\n                         the parties could sit across the table and sort out the disputes amicably\n                         or in the alternative, refer the same to Experts Settlement Council.\n                         However, NTPC did not appoint an arbitrator. NTPC suggested that the\n                         parties should resolve their disputes amicably and pursuant thereto,\n                         certain discussions were held.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">                         70.    Clearly, in these circumstances, the present application cannot be\n                         rejected by relegating the petitioner to once again seek reference of the\n                         disputes before an adjudicator. SPML had requested NTPC to appoint\n                         an adjudicator but NTPC had not done so. Thus, the contention that the\n                         present petition is pre-mature as the parties have not referred the\n                         disputes to an adjudicator, is unmerited.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">Digitally Signed         ARB.
