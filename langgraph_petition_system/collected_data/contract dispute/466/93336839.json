Arbitration as a means for resolution of disputes is well entrenched in\nmost judicial systems. In the context of commercial arbitration, there are two\ntypes - domestic arbitration and international commercial arbitration. In all\nthese disputes, minimum judicial interference in the conduct of arbitral\nproceedings is the norm. There is yet another species of arbitration which is\nthe subject matter of the present case i.e., Arbitral proceedings under\nBilateral Investment Treaties. While traditional arbitrations arise out of\ncommercial contracts entered into between individuals and companies,\narbitrations under BITs arise out of agreements signed between two\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">CS(OS) 46/2019                                                   Page 1 of 36</span>\n sovereign nations. Under these agreements, each of the States, signatory to\nthe Agreement agrees to provide Fair and Equitable Treatment to investors\nfrom the other State, as also extend protection against arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory and unfair practices. The investments made by investors of\nthe State are to be safeguarded against any expropriation and remedies are\nalso provided for adjudication of disputes through international dispute\nsettlement mechanisms. The dispute settlement mechanisms can be triggered\nboth by the aggrieved State as also an aggrieved investor from a State which\nis party to the Agreement, against the other State. Interference by domestic\ncourts in arbitral proceedings that may be commenced under BITs is\npermissible but only in `compelling circumstances‟, in `rare cases‟. Courts\nare hesitant to interfere in the arbitral process once the Tribunal is\nconstituted and is seized of the dispute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.

The background of the dispute is that Loop Telecom, an Indian\ncompany had applied for 21 Unified Access Services (hereinafter, &quot;UAS&quot;)\nLicences with the Department of Telecommunications, Government of\nIndia. Letters of Intent were issued to Loop Telecom on 25th January, 2008.\nVarious allegations were raised against the then Government in the award of\nlicences and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and other\ninvestigative agencies were directed to investigate into the said award of\nlicences. The Supreme Court in Centre for <a href=\"/doc/176344400/\" id=\"a_1\">Public Interest Litigation v.\nUnion of India</a> (2012) 3 SCC 1 (hereinafter, „CPIL‟) on 2nd February, 2012,\ninter alia, cancelled all 21 UAS licenses granted to Loop Telecom.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.

The genesis of the dispute, which has been encapsulated in the notice\ninvoking arbitration is the judgement of the Supreme Court in CPIL (supra)\nof the Supreme Court by which the Supreme Court cancelled the licences\ngranted to various companies including Loop Telecom. The judgment of the\nSupreme Court resulted in fresh recommendations being made by the\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India, and thereafter an auction being\nconducted for allocation of the spectrum and award of licenses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">18.    It can be seen that in the era of BIT agreements, even judgements of\nCourts could trigger investment disputes under the BITs resulting in\nenormous claims being raised against the Government. This is so because\nunder public international law which primarily governs BIT agreements, the\nArticles of State Responsibility specifically provide that the conduct of any\norgan of the State can be called to question. <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 4</a> of the Responsibility\nof States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001 reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">            &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 4:</a> Conduct of Organs of a State\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">            1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered\n                an act of that State under international law,\n                whether the organ exercises legislative, executive,\n                judicial or any other functions, whatever position it\n                holds in the organisation of the State, and whatever\n                its character as an organ of the central\n                Government or of a territorial unit of that State.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">            2. An organ includes any person or entity which has\n                that status in accordance with the internal law of\n                the State.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">19.    The issue arises as to whether in the Indian context, where the\njudiciary is independent of the other organs of the State, its conduct can be\ncalled to question in an arbitral proceeding and the Government of India can\nbe made liable for a judgement passed by the Court. Theoretically speaking,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">CS(OS) 46/2019                                                     Page 13 of 36</span>\n the answer is in the affirmative, though it depends on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. In the present case, though, at first blush, the\njudgment of the Supreme Court appears to be the trigger for invocation of\narbitration under the BIT Agreement, a closer examination reveals that this\nmay not be so. The findings of the Supreme Court in CPIL (supra) were that\nthe policy of first-come-first-served by the then Government was completely\nflawed and had inherently dangerous implications. The Supreme Court also\nheld that the procedure adopted by the Government was not transparent and\nfair. It held that the actions of the Government were arbitrary and capricious.\nThus, the Supreme Court‟s judgement called to question the executive action\nof the Government in arbitrary allocations of license and thereafter cancelled\nthe same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">20.    The question as to whether Defendant no.1, an investor in Loop\nTelecom has a cause of action to invoke arbitration under the BIT and\nwhether the cancellation constitutes expropriation is not for this Court\ndecide.

The remedy under a BIT Agreement is a remedy which is provided to\ninvestors from foreign countries. Presuming an investor to be a genuine\ninvestor, if the investor‟s investment in India has been prejudiced, the\ninvestor can invoke remedies available under the BIT. The availability of\nsuch remedies promotes the investor friendly ecosystem of any country.\nUnder the BIT the State holds out an assurance to protect the investments of\ninvestors from the Contracting State. An assurance given under any BIT\nsigned by the Republic of India constitutes a solemn promise by the country\nfor being a destination for safe foreign investment. The BIT provides for\nobligations and remedies which are not dependent on any other statutes or\nlaws. The BIT is self-contained and is primarily governed by principles of\npublic international law.

On 30th September, 2013,\nnotice of arbitration under <a href=\"/doc/1444915/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 8.2</a> was issued. In this notice, Khaitan\nHoldings sought restitution of its investment in Loop Telecom and the sums\nexpended by Loop Telecom in purchasing the cancelled licenses.

Reply by Defendant\nNo.1 is yet to be filed to confirm its shareholding pattern. The submission of\nthe Ld.

Admittedly, 26.95% in Loop Telecom was held by Khaitan Holdings\nas on date of invoking the arbitration. The remaining shareholding is held by\ndomestic Indian investors. Thus, if Khaitan Holdings is also for the\nbeneficial interest of Indian citizens, Loop Telecom would be nothing but a\npure Indian entity. The facts relating to the shareholding of Shri Ishwari\nPrasad Khaitan and Smt Kiran Khaitan in Loop Telecom, as per the learned\nASG, were revealed only in the criminal proceedings, which were\ncommenced pursuant to the judgment of the Supreme Court. The other\nallegation is that Defendant Nos.3 and 4 i.e. Shri Ishwari Prasad Khaitan and\nSmt Kiran Khaitan were fronts for Defendant No.5 - Shri Ruia.

Thus, the investment made by a Mauritian investor has to be in\naccordance with the laws and regulations in India for it to fall within the BIT\nAgreement.

The principle that arbitrators have the\n           jurisdiction to consider and decide the existence and\n           extent of their own jurisdiction is variously referred to\n           as the kompetenz-kompetenz principle or the &#x27;who\n           decides&#x27; question.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">           136.

The continuation of the arbitral proceedings under the BIT, at this\nstage, may per se not be contrary to public policy. It is a principle of public\npolicy that the Government has to honour its commitments including\nbilateral ones.

There are no exceptions to the definition of „investor‟ as are contained\nin several BIT agreements which exclude entities indirectly owned or\ncontrolled by citizens of a contracting State. The BIT Agreement has to have\nspecific provisions, if such exclusions are to be read into the definition of\n`investor‟. The BIT between India and Mauritius subject matter of the\npresent case was executed in 1998 with effect from 20th June 2000.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">51.    It is seen that due to issues that have arisen in various disputes like the\npresent case, recently, in 2016, the Union of India has introduced a `Model\nText for the Indian Bilateral Investment Treaty‟, the provisions of which are\ndifferent from the BIT Agreement which is the subject matter of the present\ndispute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">52.    The arbitral proceedings, at the moment, are however, governed by\nthe BIT that is currently in force between the parties. The proceedings in the\npresent case commenced way back in 2013 when the notice invoking\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">CS(OS) 46/2019                                                      Page 33 of 36</span>\n arbitration was issued. The Tribunal has been constituted in May 2018.\nThereafter the first hearing of the Tribunal was scheduled for 28 th January\n2019. Prior to the first hearing of the Tribunal, the Republic of India has\nchallenged the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to proceed with the\narbitration. While holding that the jurisdiction of this Court is not ousted\nfrom hearing the present suit and that there is no acquiescence by the\nRepublic of India to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, which estops it\nfrom approaching this Court, it is held that the question as to whether\nKhaitan Holdings is a genuine `investor‟, based out of Mauritius, which can\ninvoke the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is a question to be\ndetermined by the Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the BIT Agreement. It\nis nigh possible that the foreign investor is not a real investor but Defendant\nno.3 Sh. Ishwari Prasad Khaitan, posing as one. The Arbitral Tribunal\nwould, as part of its enquiry, look into this issue as to whether Khaitan\nHoldings is a bona fide investor and whether the invocation of the\narbitration clause by Khaitan Holdings is an attempt to take unfair advantage\nas held in the case of Phoenix Action Ltd Vs. The Czech Republic (ICSID\nCase No. ARB/06/5).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">53.      The grounds on which the Republic of India seeks an anti-arbitration\ninjunction are inter alia as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">       That Khaitan Holdings is not a genuine investor due to the clear link\n         and control by Sh. Ishwari Prasad Khaitan and Smt.Kiran Khaitan of\n         both Khaitan Holdings (Mauritius) and Loop Telecom;\n       That the BIT cannot be invoked by an entity, though incorporated in\n         Mauritius, but is actually controlled by Indian citizens;\n       That there has been no expropriation as due process has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">CS(OS) 46/2019                                                       Page 34 of 36</span>\n          followed and the decision to cancel the licences was rendered by the\n         Supreme Court of India in public interest;\n       That the entire foreign investment, being through the automatic route,\n         was subject to Indian laws under the UASL;\n       That Loop Telecom has already availed of its remedies against the\n         cancellation of its licences under Indian law and hence rights under\n         the BIT stand waived;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">       Overlapping nature of the claims raised by Loop Telecom before\n         TDSAT and Defendant no.1 in the arbitral proceedings;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">54.      All the above grounds, are those that can be that with and decided by\nthe Arbitral Tribunal. The arbitration having been invoked in 2013 and the\nTribunal having been constituted and being seized of the dispute, it is not for\nthis Court to adjudicate on these issues. The above issues ought to be raised\nby the Republic of India before the Arbitral Tribunal, which under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article\n21</a>, would rule upon the same. The proceedings which are already underway\ncannot be termed as being oppressive, vexatious or an abuse of process at\nthis stage. The prayer for ad-interim relief seeking stay of the arbitral\nproceedings commenced by Khaitan Holdings under the BIT, is accordingly\nrejected, at this stage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">55.
