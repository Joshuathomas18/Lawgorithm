It is\nurged that after the termination of contracts, which is by\nthe order of Managing Director, applicant has come to\nknow about the fact that the Managing Director is having\npervasive control over the functioning of Madhya Pradesh\nUrja Vikas Nigam and there is likelihood of bias in case\nthe dispute in question is arbitered by him, as he would\nthen be a judge of his own cause and applicant will be\ndeprived of fair hearing. It is further contended that even\nstatutory provision aims at for appointment of an\nindependent and impartial Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">6.

The respondents, on their turn, have contradicted the\nstand. While not disputing that the contracts in question\nare terminated by the order of the Managing Director, the\nrespondent, however, deny that the reference to named\nArbitrator and the dispute being arbitered by him will\ncause any prejudice to the applicant merely because the\nnamed Arbitrator happened to terminate the contracts.\nWhile contradicting that the Managing Director have a\npervasive control over day-to-day activities of the\nCorporation, it is urged that he has overall supervisory\ncontrol over working of the Corporation as would give\nrise to an occasion of any likelihood of bias if he\ndischarges as an Arbitrator. It is further contended that the\napplicant having agreed over the terms and conditions of\ncontract agreement now cannot resile from the same. It is\nalso submitted that on applicant raising the dispute, the\nmatter   has   been    referred       to   Arbitrator     and    a\ncommunication to that effect was entered into on\n                             :: 5 ::\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"61100372\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_6\">A.C.

However,\nsuch indulgence is not shown in respect of demand made\nfor referring the dispute qua termination of contract which\nis subject matter of A.C. No.53/2014 and A.C.\nNo.54/2014). While denying the contention that the\nManaging Director of the Corporation and the Secretary,\nDepartment of New and Renewable Energy, Govt. of\nM.P. are one and same, it is urged that if the petitioner has\nany grievance against the Managing Director, Secretary,\nDepartment of New and Renewable Energy, Govt. of\nMadhya Pradesh, who is also a named Arbitrator can\nresolve the dispute. It is further urged that the applicant\neven before entering into adjudication has prejudged that\nthere is likelihood of bias, if the Managing Director or for\nthat even Secretary, Department of New and Renewal\nEnergy acts an an Arbitrator. But, without any cogent\nmaterial on record as would lead to an irreversible\nconclusion that the Arbitrator is biased, the application for\nappointment of independent arbitrator is liable to be\nrejected.

Present are the applications under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 11(6)</a> of\n1996 Act which makes a provision for appointment of an\nArbitrator in three circumstances, viz. (i) party fails to act\nas required under the agreed procedure; or (ii) the parties\nor the two appointed arbitrators, fail to reach an\nagreement expected of them under that procedure; or (iii)\na person including an institution, fails to perform any\nfunction entrusted to him or it under that procedure.

The crucial expression in sub-section (6)\n     is &quot;a party may request the Chief Justice or any\n     person or institution designated by him to take\n     the necessary measures&quot; (underlined for\n     emphasis). This expression has to read\n     alongwith requirement in sub-section (8) that\n     the Chief Justice or the person or an institution\n     designated by him in appointing an arbitrator\n     shall have &quot;due regard&quot; to the two cumulative\n     conditions relating to qualifications and other\n     considerations as are likely to secure the\n     appointment of an independent and impartial\n     arbitrator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">     12. A bare reading of the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n     11</a> shows that the emphasis is on the terms of\n     the agreement being adhered to and/or given\n     effect as closely as possible. In other words,\n     the Court may ask to do what has not been\n     done. The court must first ensure that the\n     remedies provided for are exhausted. It is true\n     as contended by Mr. Desai, that it is not\n     mandatory for the Chief Justice or any person\n     or institution designated by him to appoint the\n     named arbitrator or arbitrators. But at the same\n     time, due regard has to be given to the\n     qualifications required by the agreement and\n     other considerations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">                           :: 8 ::\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                                    A.C.

The expression `due regard&#x27; means that\n     proper attention to several circumstances have\n     been focussed. The expression `necessary&#x27; as a\n     general rule can be broadly stated to be those\n     things which are reasonably required to be\n     done     or    legally    ancillary   to    the\n     accomplishment of the intended act. Necessary\n     measures can be stated to be the reasonable\n     steps required to be taken.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     14. In all these cases at hand the High Court\n     does not appear to have focussed on the\n     requirement to have due regard to the\n     qualifications required by the agreement or\n     other considerations necessary to secure the\n     appointment of an independent and impartial\n     arbitrator. It needs no reiteration that\n     appointment of the arbitrator or arbitrators\n     named in the arbitration agreement is not a\n     must, but while making the appointment the\n     twin requirements of sub-section (8) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\n     11</a> have to be kept in view, considered and\n     taken into account. If it is not done, the\n     appointment becomes vulnerable. In the\n     circumstances, we set aside the appointment\n     made in each case, remit the matters to the\n     High Court to make fresh appointments\n     keeping in view the parameters indicated\n     above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">11.
