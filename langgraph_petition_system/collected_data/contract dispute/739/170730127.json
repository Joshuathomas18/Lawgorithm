The appellants herein invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking a\nwrit of mandamus directing the State of Uttarakhand to enquire into the\nmatter of invitation of tenders and allotment of work under the District Plan\nin the year 2014-15, as to how tenders for work in excess of financial\nsanction were called for, and contracts on behalf of the Government were\nentered into with the appellants; a mandamus directing the respondent\nauthorities to clear payment of the appellants, as the work entrusted to them\nhad been completed about three years ago; and a mandamus directing the\nrespondent authorities to pay interest @ 18% per annum to the appellants on\nthe outstanding amount, as the work entrusted to them had been completed\nabout three years back.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.    While larger questions of whether the State Government was justified\nin executing works without availability of funds are raised, these questions\nare merely a disguised attempt to have contractual disputes adjudicated in\nwrit proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, as the main relief\nsought for in the writ petition was to direct the respondents to pay the\nappellants the outstanding amounts allegedly due for the works executed by\nthem for the State Government.      The appellants&#x27; grievance in the writ\npetition, in short, is that they were awarded construction works under the\nZila Yojana during the Financial Years 2013-14 to 2016-17; separate\ncontracts were signed between the appellants and respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6; the\nworks, awarded under the contracts, were completed three years&#x27; ago;\nhowever payment, in respect of the works, has not been released till date; as\nthe appellants had completed the works, they have been requesting the\nrespondent authorities to release payment, but no action was taken; when no\npayment was received, the appellants and other similarly situated contractors\nsought information from the fifth respondent, vide letter dated 11.09.2017,\nregarding the funds sanctioned / released, tenders invited, etc. towards the\nwork done under the District Plan; the information furnished by the fifth\nrespondent is that respondent Nos. 4 &amp; 5 had called for tenders much\nbeyond the sanctioned limits; yet another information secured by the\nappellants discloses that, while several works were completed from 2013-14\nto 2016-17, no payment has been made to them; there was no dispute\nregarding the work, its quality or of violation of any terms and conditions;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                        3</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">they submitted letter dated 18.08.2018 for refund of the retention money,\nwhich is liable to be returned after completion of the &quot;defect liability\nperiod&quot;; the appellants met respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6 in their office on\n18.08.2018, and they were assured that action would be taken; the cause for\nnon-payment was non-availability of funds with the State Government; this\nhas occurred on account of the lapse in the tendering process even without\navailability of finances; the appellants are being subjected to unnecessary\nharassment at the hands of the respondent authorities; a sum of ` 52,00,981/-\nis due to the first appellant and ` 32,24,793/- is due to the second appellant;\nthough there is an arbitration clause in the contract, the same is of no\nconsequence; there is no dispute regarding the liability from the side of the\nPublic Works Department; since the arbitration clause provides that an\nofficer of the rank of a Superintending Engineer shall be appointed as an\nArbitrator, there is very little hope that the appellants would have any say in\nfront of the might of the State; as the amounts are not being paid on account\nof non-availability of funds, there is no hope of the Arbitrator doing\nanything; and the action of the respondents is arbitrary and illegal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.    In the order under appeal, the learned Single Judge noted the\nappellants&#x27; contention that they had executed works for the respondent\nauthorities for which payment had not been made to them; hence, they had\ninvoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking a direction to the State to\nrelease payment; an objection had been raised, on behalf of the respondents,\nthat the appellants had not annexed the contract on the basis of which they\nwere awarded the work; Government contracts, generally, have an\narbitration clause which the appellants can invoke; since the contract has not\nbeen filed before this Court, nothing could be said on this aspect; and\nconsidering the nature of the case, the writ petition was being dismissed in\nlimine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"161366758\" id=\"span_3\">5.    Before us Mr. Davesh Bishnoi, learned counsel for the appellants-writ\npetitioners, would submit that, since the facts are not in dispute and non-\npayment of the amounts, towards the works executed by the appellants, is\nonly for the reason of non-availability of funds with the State Government,\nthe appellants cannot be relegated to the remedy of invoking the arbitration\nclause of the agreement; a writ petition would lie to this Court even in cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        4</span>\n\n\n\ninvolving non-statutory contracts, in which no disputed questions of fact\narise for consideration; and the learned Single Judge has, therefore, erred in\nrefusing to entertain the writ petition, and in dismissing it in limine. Learned\ncounsel would rely on a Division Bench judgment of this Court in M/s <a href=\"/doc/161366758/\" id=\"a_2\">S.M.\nConstruction vs. State of Uttarakhand &amp; others</a> (judgment in Special\nAppeal No. 742 of 2018 dated 30.10.2018).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121921120\" id=\"span_5\">6.    On the question of maintainability of a writ petition involving\ncontractual disputes, a distinction must be made between statutory and non-\nstatutory contracts. A contract would not become statutory simply because\nit has been awarded by the Government or a statutory body. Merely because\nthe obligations imposed by the contract, on the contracting parties, fall\nwithin the purview of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_3\">Contract Act</a>, would also not make the contract\nstatutory.   A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on the\nGovernment or a statutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to\ndischarge its functions. The fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a\nstatutory or a public body will not by itself affect the principles to be\napplied, for every act of a statutory body need not necessarily involve an\nexercise of statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private parties, have the\npower to contract or deal with property. Such activities may not raise any\nissue of public law. (<a href=\"/doc/121921120/\" id=\"a_4\">Kerala State Electricity Board &amp; others vs. Kurien\nE. Kalathil &amp; others</a>[1]). Merely because a contract is entered into, in the\nexercise of an enabling power conferred by a statute, would not by itself\nrender the contract statutory. It is only if entering into a contract, containing\nthe prescribed terms and conditions, is a must under the statute would the\ncontract be held to be statutory in character. A contract may contain terms\nand conditions which may not be statutory, and which have been\nincorporated therein as a result of mutual agreement between the parties.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1941195\" id=\"span_6\">(<a href=\"/doc/1941195/\" id=\"a_5\">India Thermal Power Ltd. vs. State of M.P. &amp; others</a>[2]). The contract,\nin the present case, is admittedly not statutory in character. Unlike disputes\narising out of statutory contracts which can be adjudicated in writ\nproceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, within the limited\nparameters of judicial review, non-statutory contractual disputes stand on a\ndifferent footing.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                       5</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">7.    On the question whether a writ petition would lie under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution of India for resolution of non-statutory contractual disputes,\nor for enforcement of obligations arising therefrom, one line of judicial\npronouncement of the Supreme Court is that the remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 226</a>\nof the Constitution of India is barred in such matters. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"360008\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/360008/\" id=\"a_9\">Lekhraj\nSatramdas, Lalvani vs. Deputy Custodin-cum-Managing Officer &amp;\nothers</a>[3], the Supreme Court held that a writ of mandamus may be granted\nonly in a case where there is a statutory duty imposed, there is failure to\ndischarge that statutory obligation, and any duty or obligation arising out of\na contract cannot be enforced by the machinery of a writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 226</a>\nof the Constitution.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"557202\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/557202/\" id=\"a_11\">Banchhanidhi Rath vs. The State of Orissa &amp;\nothers</a>[4], the Supreme Court held that a right claimed in terms of a contract\ncannot be enforced in a writ petition.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1159364\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/1159364/\" id=\"a_12\">Har Shankar &amp; others vs. The\nDeputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner &amp; others</a>[5], a Constitution\nBench of the Supreme Court held that a writ petition was not an appropriate\nremedy for impeaching contractual obligations.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_13\">Radhakrishna Agarwal\n&amp; others v.

On the\n      allegations and affidavit evidence before us we cannot reach such a\n      conclusion. Moreover, as we have already indicated earlier, the\n      correct view is that it is the contract and not the executive power,\n      regulated by the Constitution, which governs the relations of the\n      parties....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">8.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"248227\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/248227/\" id=\"a_15\">Divisional Forest Officer vs. Bishwanath Tea Co.

In Kerala State Electricity\nBoard1, the Supreme Court held that the interpretation and implementation\nof a clause in a contract cannot be the subject matter of a writ petition; if a\nterm of a contract is violated, ordinarily, the remedy is not a writ petition\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226;</a> the contract between the parties was in the realm of\nprivate law; disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                          7</span>\n\n\n\na non-statutory contract could not have been agitated in a petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India; and it was a matter for adjudication\nby a civil court, or in arbitration if provided for in the contract.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">10.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"460900\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/460900/\" id=\"a_22\">State of Bihar &amp; others vs. Jain Plastics &amp; Chemicals Ltd.</a>[12]\nthe Supreme Court held that, while it was true that many matters could be\ndecided after referring to the contentions raised in the affidavits and counter-\naffidavits but that was hardly a ground for exercise of the extraordinary\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution in case of alleged breach of\ncontract; such seriously disputed questions or rival claims of the parties,\nwith regard to breach of contract, was to be investigated and determined on\nthe basis of evidence which may be led by the parties in a properly instituted\ncivil suit, rather than by a Court exercising the prerogative of issuing writs.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">11.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191872\" id=\"span_19\">In <a href=\"/doc/191872/\" id=\"a_24\">National Highway Authority of India vs. Ganga Enterprises &amp;\nothers</a>[13], the Supreme Court held that disputes relating to contracts cannot\nbe agitated under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"855552\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/855552/\" id=\"a_26\">Pimpri\nChinchwad Municipal Corporation &amp; others vs. Gayatri Construction\nCompany &amp; others</a>[14], the Supreme Court, following its earlier judgments\nin National Highway Authority of India13, Kerala State Electricity\nBoard1, India Thermal Power Ltd.2, and Bridge &amp; Roof Co.

Public interest as noticed hereinbefore, may be\n            one of the factors to exercise the power of judicial review. In\n            a case where a public law element is involved, judicial\n            review may be permissible. (See <a href=\"/doc/261493/\" id=\"a_53\">Binny Ltd. v. V.

As noted hereinabove, while one line of judicial pronouncements of\nthe Supreme Court is that a writ petition would not lie for resolution of non-\nstatutory contractual disputes, the other line of decisions is that, while\ninterference is permissible, it is on limited grounds of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 14</a>\nof the Constitution of India and is, in any event, a matter to be decided by\nthe High Court in its discretion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_41\">22.   It must, however, be borne in mind that, while there is no absolute bar\nto the maintainability of a writ petition even in non-statutory contractual\nmatters or where there are disputed questions of fact or even when a\nmonetary claim is raised, discretion lies with the High Court which, under\ncertain circumstances, it can refuse to exercise. It also follows that under the\nfollowing circumstances, &#x27;normally&#x27;, the Court would not exercise such\ndiscretion i.e. (1) the Court may not examine the issue unless the action has\nsome public law character attached to it; (2) whenever a particular mode of\nsettlement of disputes is provided in the contract, the High Court would\nrefuse to exercise its discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, and\nrelegate the party to the said mode of settlement, particularly when\nsettlement of disputes is to be resorted to through the means of arbitration;\n(3) if there are serious disputed questions of fact which are of a complex\nnature and require oral evidence for their determination; and (4) money\nclaims per se, particularly arising out of contractual obligations, are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                       12</span>\n\n\n\nnormally not to be entertained except in exceptional circumstances.

If the contract, between a private party and the State/instrumentality\nand/or agency of State, is under the realm of private law, and there is no\nelement of public law, the normal course for the aggrieved party is to invoke\nthe remedies provided under the ordinary civil law rather than approaching\nthe High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 226</a> of the Constitutional of India and invoking\nits extraordinary jurisdiction. (Joshi Technologies International Inc.24).\nThe remedies for a breach of contract, being purely in the realm of contract,\nare dealt with by Civil Courts. The public law remedy, by way of a Writ\nPetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, is not available to\nseek damages for breach of contract or specific performance of contract.\nHowever, where the contractual dispute has a public law element, the power\nof judicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India may be\nexercised.

The distinction between public law and private law assumes\nsignificance as this Court would not, ordinarily, exercise its extraordinary\njurisdiction, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, to adjudicate\ndisputes in the private law realm. What then is &quot;Public Law&quot;? Public law is\na system which enforces the proper performance by public bodies of the\nduties which they owe to the public. Every &quot;body&quot; which is created by a\nstatute, and whose powers and duties are defined by the statute, is a &#x27;public\nauthority&#x27;. Private law is a system which protects the private rights of\nprivate individuals or the private rights of public bodies. Distinction therein\nis that the public as a whole is the beneficiary of what is protected by public\nlaw, and it is the individuals or bodies entitled to the right which are\nbeneficiaries of the protection provided by private law. Not all decisions\ntaken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject-matter\nof judicial review. In the following two situations, judicial review will not\nnormally be appropriate even though the body may be performing a public\nfunction:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                       13</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (a)    Where some other branch of the law more appropriately\n             governs the dispute between the parties.

In such a case,\n             the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally\n             govern the matter. This reflects the normal approach, namely,\n             that the terms of a contract will normally govern the\n             transaction, or other relationship between the parties, rather\n             than the general law.         Thus, where a special method of\n             resolving disputes (such as arbitration or resolution by private\n             or domestic tribunals) has been agreed upon by the parties\n             (expressly or by necessary implication), that regime, and not\n             judicial review, will normally govern the dispute.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1550136\" id=\"span_45\">(Desmith, Woolf and Jowell&#x27;s Judicial Review of Administrative\nAction, 5th Edition; <a href=\"/doc/1550136/\" id=\"a_64\">Hindustan Petroleum Corporation vs. Ali Jafar</a>[26])</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1702971\" id=\"span_46\">25.   Public duty can never be equated to that of an obligation to any person\nor identifiable group of persons. Public duty is owed to the public in general\nand not specifically to any person or group of individuals. That is the\nprecise character of a public law duty in contra distinction to private law,\nwhich is normally founded upon a contract or tort etc., as the case may be.\n(Ali Jafar26). The public law remedy is enforceable, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution, where the actions of the authority fall in the realm of public\nlaw - be it a legislative act of the State, an executive act of the State or an\ninstrumentality or a person or authority imbibed with a public law element.\nThe question is required to be determined in each case having the\naforementioned principles in mind.

The critical distinction arises out of the\n      fact that it is the public as a whole, or in the case of local\n      government the public in the locality, who are the beneficiaries of\n      what is protected by public law and it is the individuals or bodies\n      entitled to the rights who are the beneficiaries of the protection\n      provided by private law...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">             (see page 221 of this Article &quot;Public Law Private Law: Why the\n      Divide?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      A personal View (published in &quot;Public Law&quot; Summer: (1986)&quot;)\n\n             The learned Law Lord stated further in the same Article, at page\n      223:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      &quot;While public law deals only with public bodies, this does not\n      mean that the activities of public bodies are never governed by\n      private law. Like public figures, at lest in theory, public bodies are\n      entitled to have a private life There have been suggestions that in\n      the commercial field public bodies should adopt different and\n      higher ethical standards than private individuals, but this is not\n      yet required as a matter of law and in relation to purely\n      commercial transactions the same law is applicable, whether or\n      not a public duty is involved. Prima facie, the same is true in\n      relation to employment. The servant employed by a public body\n      ordinarily has the same private rights as any other servant.....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">27.   The distinction between public law remedies, and those in the private\nlaw field, cannot be demarcated with precision.       Each case should be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                       16</span>\n\n\n\nexamined on its facts whether the contractual relations between the parties\nbear the insignia of a public element. Once, on the facts of a particular case,\nit is found that the nature of the activity or controversy involves a public law\nelement, then the matter can be examined by the High Court in writ petitions\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to ascertain whether the action\nof the State and/or instrumentality or agency of the State is fair, just and\nequitable or that relevant factors are taken into consideration and irrelevant\nfactors have not gone into the decision making process or that the decision is\nnot arbitrary. (Joshi Technologies International Inc.24).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27844805\" id=\"span_53\">28.   A writ court should, ordinarily, not entertain a writ petition, if there is\na breach of contract involving disputed questions of fact. (M.K. Jose23).\nContractual disputes are, ordinarily, outside the purview of judicial review\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 226</a>, with the exception of contractual disputes having a public\nlaw element. (<a href=\"/doc/27844805/\" id=\"a_73\">Rishi Kiran Logistics Private Limited vs. Board of\nTrustees of Kandla Port Trust and others</a>[30]). A writ petition, under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 226</a>, is not the proper proceedings for adjudicating contractual\ndisputes. Under the law, it was open to a party to the contract to approach\nthe court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate relief for breach of\ncontract. When an alternative and equally efficacious remedy is open to the\nlitigant, he should be required to pursue that remedy and not invoke the writ\njurisdiction of the High Court. Equally, the existence of an alternative\nremedy does not affect the jurisdiction of the court to issue a writ but\nordinarily that would be a good ground for refusing to exercise the discretion\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226.</a> (Jain Plastics and Chemicals Ltd.12; M.K. Jose23). The\nscope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of\ncontractual obligations may be more limited, and in doubtful cases the\nparties may be relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies\nprovided   for   adjudication    of   purely   contractual    disputes.   (Joshi\nTechnologies International Inc.24). Disputed questions or rival claims of\nthe parties with regard to breach of contract are to be investigated and\ndetermined on the basis of evidence which may be led by the parties in a\nproperly instituted civil suit rather than by a court exercising the prerogative\nof issuing writs. (Jain Plastics and Chemicals Ltd.12; M.K. Jose23). While\nmatters can be decided after referring to the contentions raised in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                         17</span>\n\n\n\naffidavits and counter-affidavits, that would hardly be a ground for exercise\nof the extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_76\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution in case\nof alleged breach of contract. (Jain Plastics and Chemicals Ltd.12; M.K.\nJose23).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">29.   The question, therefore, is not of lack of jurisdiction but of exercise of\ndiscretion. While even disputed questions of fact can be adjudicated by the\nHigh Court, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, such disputed\nquestions of fact, more so, when they relate to non-statutory contractual\ndisputes, which are in private law realm, are better suited for adjudication\neither before the arbitral tribunal constituted in terms of the agreement or\nbefore a civil court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">30.   The dispute, in the present writ proceedings, arises under a non-\nstatutory contract, and is in the realm of private law.           The public law\nremedy, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot, normally, be\npermitted to be invoked to adjudicate non-statutory contractual disputes.\nOrdinarily, when a dispute between the parties requires adjudication of\ndisputed question of facts wherefor the parties are required to lead evidence,\nboth oral and documentary which can be determined by a domestic forum\nchosen by the parties, this Court may not entertain a writ application. The\nquestion as to when such a discretionary jurisdiction is to be exercised, or\nrefused to be exercised, by the High Court, has to be determined having\nregard to the facts and circumstances of each case, and no hard-and-fast rule\ncan be laid down. (Sanjana M. Wig28).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">31.   It is not as if, in all cases where the writ petitioners claim that certain\namounts are admittedly due to them, the Court is bound to entertain the writ\npetition, for it lies in its discretion to refuse to entertain the writ petition and\nto relegate the writ petitioners to the remedy of either invoking the\narbitration clause in the agreement or to approach the competent civil court.\nShorn of all verbiage, and their attempts to present it as a public law dispute\nnotwithstanding, the appellants-writ petitioners, in effect, only seek payment\nof the amounts allegedly due to them, for the works executed by them for the\nrespondents, with interest @ 18% per annum. While they have sought to\ndisguise this claim by raising other questions only to bring it in the public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                       18</span>\n\n\n\nlaw realm, the aforesaid relief which they have sought is purely in the\nprivate law field for which they ought to have either invoked the arbitration\nclause of the agreement, or if the said clause is inapplicable, to then\napproach the competent civil court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">32.   While its jurisdiction, even to entertain non-statutory contractual\ndisputes, is not barred, this Court would, ordinarily, refrain from exercising\nits extra-ordinary jurisdiction, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,\nto entertain writ petitions involving disputes in the contractual realm, as\nthese matters are more suited for adjudication either before an Arbitrator (if\nthe agreement contains an arbitration clause) or before the competent civil\ncourt before which evidence can be adduced by both the parties, and the lis\nadjudicated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121996901\" id=\"span_56\">33.   As reliance is placed on behalf of the appellants-writ petitioners on a\nDivision Bench judgment of this Court, it is necessary to take note of its\ncontents. In M/s S.M. Construction (judgment in Special Appeal No. 742\nof 2018 dated 30.10.2018), the appellant had executed certain construction\nworks in the Irrigation Department; though the work had been executed,\npayment was not made to the appellant; and the appellant claimed that there\nwas no dispute with regards the execution of the work. The Division Bench\nnoted that the learned Single Judge had not examined the plea taken by the\nappellant that the respondents had admitted of execution of the work by the\nappellant, and there was no violation of any of the terms and conditions of\nthe work order. The Division Bench observed that it is settled law that, if it\nis admitted by the respondents that there is no dispute regarding execution of\nthe work, disputed questions of fact can also be examined in a writ petition\nfiled under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The Division Bench\nrelied on an earlier Division Bench judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/121996901/\" id=\"a_81\">Kawaljeet\nSingh Talwar vs. State of Uttarakhand &amp; others</a> (judgment in Special\nAppeal No. 914 of 2017 dated 27.11.2017)[31], wherein it was held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            &quot;6. .....When a matter arises under a contract, it is true that\n      ordinarily the Court would relegate the party to a competent\n      forum, but this is not an inflexible or invariable rule. The power of\n      the writ court is wide enough to deal with injustice wherever it is\n      found. In fact, the Courts in India are not trammeled by technicalities\n      of the law, which bogged down the English Courts. It is also true\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                        19</span>\n\n\n\n      that if the disputed questions of fact arise, it may be a ground to\n      turn away a writ applicant even in a writ of mandamus. It is not\n      the law that the writ court cannot decide a question of fact. When\n      a case is brought up before the court for the first time, by the\n      nature of the case, the Court may be in a position to turn-away an\n      applicant on the basis that it necessarily would involve\n      adjudicating a highly disputed question of fact, which cannot be\n      decided, except after oral evidence is taken. The question as to\n      whether a disputed question of fact arises, in many cases, would,\n      however, depend upon the pleadings, which are introduced in\n      response to the writ petition by the answering respondent(s). In a\n      case, which may arise out of a contract, if the complaint is that the\n      work has been done by a contractor and there is absolutely no dispute\n      regarding the fulfillment of the contract raised by the respondent, it\n      may not be a proper exercise of the jurisdiction, wide as it is, to\n      relegate a party to the prolix process of the Civil Court, when there is\n      nothing much to be decided by the Civil Court. There may be other\n      reasons like paucity of fund as in fact is the case, which is sought to\n      be projected in this case. We do notice that ordinarily the matters\n      relating to enforcement of contractual rights should not be\n      entertained by the writ court, but if the dispute is only relating to\n      the non-payment of an amount, which is totally beyond the pale of\n      doubt, in appropriate cases, the writ court can entertain such\n      cases......&quot;(emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">34.   The Division Bench set-aside the order passed by the learned Single\nJudge and directed the respondents to make payment of the admitted work\nexecuted by the appellant within a period of 10 weeks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">35.   Unlike in M/s S.M. Construction and Kawaljeet Singh Talwar31, in\nthe present case, the writ petition has been dismissed in limine. Neither was\nthe writ petition admitted, nor were the respondents called upon to file their\ncounter affidavits.   While the appellants claim that there is no dispute\nregarding the amounts payable to them, this assertion of the appellants could\nonly have been rebutted or disputed by the respondents, if the learned Single\nJudge had chosen to entertain the writ petition, and had called upon the\nrespondents to file their counter affidavits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">36.   It must also be borne in mind that this intra-court appeal is preferred\nagainst the order of the learned Single Judge refusing to exercise his\ndiscretionary jurisdiction, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, to\nentertain the writ petition. It is the internal working of the High court which\nsplits it into different &#x27;benches&#x27; and yet the court remains one. In an intra-\ncourt appeal, the Division bench, sitting as a court of correction, corrects its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                        20</span>\n\n\n\nown orders in the exercise of the same jurisdiction as was vested in the\nSingle bench, i.e. under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.          The\njudgment under appeal cannot be faulted on the ground that an alternative\nview, which might commend itself to the appellate court, has not been\naccepted by the learned Single Judge. At least, such review is not open to an\nappellate court hearing appeals against orders made under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution which is a discretionary remedy. Interference can only be on an\nerror of principle but not on re-evaluation of evidence; nor on the basis of\npreferential choice of alternatives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">37.   Viewed from any angle, we are satisfied that the order of the learned\nSingle Judge does not suffer from a patent error or illegality necessitating\ninterference in an intra-court appeal.       As the learned Single Judge has\nexercised his discretion not to entertain the writ petition, and has dismissed it\nin limine, suffice it to make it clear that neither the order under appeal, nor\nthe order now passed by us, shall disable the appellants-writ petitioners from\navailing their remedy of invoking the arbitration clause in the agreement (if\nsuch a remedy is available), and if it is not, from availing their common law\nremedy of filing a suit before the Civil Court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">38.   Subject to the aforesaid observations, the appeal fails and is,\naccordingly, dismissed. However, in the circumstances, without costs.\n</p>\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">        (Alok Singh, J.)                    (Ramesh Ranganathan, C.
