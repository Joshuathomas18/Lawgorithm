CASE OF THE PETITIONERS:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (a)   Second   Petitioner-Company      and   the   KPCL\n\nentered into a Joint Venture Agreement on 13.09.2002\n\nfor establishing a Joint Venture Company to undertake\n\ndevelopment &amp; mining activity. Accordingly, the first\n\npetitioner came to be incorporated as a Joint Venture\n\nCompany for the purpose of development &amp; operation of\n\nthe Captive Coal Mines allocated to KPCL by the Central\n\nGovernment.    The coal extracted from these mines was\n\nexclusively meant for the thermal power stations of\n\nKPCL. The second petitioner &amp; its nominees on the one\n\npart hold 74% of the equity shares of first petitioner-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">company, and the KPCL on the other holds the remaining\n\n26% of equity shares. It was the responsibility of second\n\nrespondent to discharge the contractual obligations.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       6</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">      (b)     The Coal Ministry of Central Government vide\n\nletter dated 10.11.2003 allocated certain Captive Coal\n\nBlocks in Chandpur district of Maharashtra to the KPCL\n\nfor power generation in the thermal power stations at\n\nBTPS. A Notification to this effect came to be issued on\n\n16.07.2004. The Central Government taking note of\n\nOfficial    Site    Clearance,       granted      prior    approval    on\n\n31.01.2006         u/s   5(1)    of       the    <a href=\"/doc/198881428/\" id=\"a_7\">Mines    and     Minerals\n\n(Development and Regulation) Act, 1957</a>.                     After formal\n\ncompliances, a Mining Lease was executed between the\n\nfirst petitioner and the Government of Maharashtra on\n\n25.09.2006.        Keeping      in        view    the     Joint   Venture\n\nAgreement, the first petitioner and KPCL entered into a\n\nFuel Supply Agreement (FSA) on 9.5.2007 for recording\n\nthe terms &amp; conditions for supply of coal to BTPS for a\n\nperiod of 25 years.             It also provided for furnishing\n\nfinancial securities to the said petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">      (c)     The allocation of subject Coal Blocks in favour\n\nof first petitioner, and Central Government&#x27;s Notification\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                              7</span>\n\n\n\ndated 16.7.2004 referred to above were put in challenge\n\nin W.P.Nos.10788/2006, 12867/2006 &amp; 17828/2006; the\n\nchallengers had obtained interim orders of stay. These\n\ncases to which KPCL was also impleaded as a respondent\n\nwere before this court and the Nagpur Bench of Bombay\n\nHigh Court.    Particulars of these cases and of SLP (C)\n\nNo.1310/2007 arising from one of them, are furnished in\n\na tabular form by the petitioners. The subject SLP was\n\ndismissed on 5.4.2007. W.P.No.17828/2006 came to be\n\ndismissed by this court on 2.7.2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">     (d)      After all the litigations came to an end, the\n\nfirst rake of coal was dispatched from the Captive Coal\n\nBlocks by the first petitioner-company to BTPS on\n\n29.9.2008. Governmental processes and the litigations\n\ncaused delay in the commencement of mining activities\n\nand dispatch of coal. The factors that caused such delay\n\nwere beyond the control of petitioners and therefore, the\n\nimpugned demand could not have been raised.           Even\n\notherwise, this delay was condoned by the KPCL and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\ntherefore it could not have turned around and raised the\n\ndemand on an assumed contra substratum. Learned Sr.\n\nAdvocate appearing for the petitioners also argued that\n\nsubject    clauses      of   Fuel   Supply     Agreement     do not\n\nauthorize the KPCL to quantify damages and levy penalty\n\nsans judicial determination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">     In support of above submissions, learned Sr.\n\nAdvocate pressed into service certain Rulings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">     5.     THE CASE OF KPCL IN BRIEF:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (a)    Several statutory processes as averred in the\n\npetitions and the Agreements in question are not in\n\ndispute. First petitioner committed breach of terms of\n\nthese Agreements, which authorize determination of\n\ndamages for the same; therefore the compensation\n\nhaving     been    normatively          quantified,   the   impugned\n\ndemand cannot be faltered. The purpose of incorporating\n\nthe subject terms in the Agreement, is to authorize KPCL\n\nto   assess       the    damage/loss         and      determine   the\n\ncompensation/penalty payable by the petitioners on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  9</span>\n\n\n\naccount of their breach; an argument to the contrary\n\nwould defeat such a purpose; the Agreement having\n\nbeen entered into with eyes wide open, petitioners are\n\nnot justified in placing their own interpretation on the\n\nsubject clauses thereof to their advantage and to the\n\ndetriment of KPCL.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      (b)    It is not that what the KPCL has done is final,\n\nsince petitioners can dispute the same in an appropriate\n\nsuit proceeding; the case involves disputed questions of\n\nfacts and therefore, Writ Petition is not the right\n\nredressal.    Learned Sr. Advocate highlighted the breach\n\nof Agreement and sought to justify the impugned\n\nrecovery of damages/penalty inter alia banking upon\n\naudit objections. He contended that the word &#x27;penalty&#x27;\n\nemployed in the subject Agreement should not be\n\nliterally   construed     when   it   only   meant   liquidated\n\ndamages.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      (c)    The   case   in   W.P.No.2923/2003      was   filed\n\nbefore the Nagpur Bench on 18.7.2003 inter alia on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                     10</span>\n\n\n\nground that allocation of coal mines could not be done in\n\nfavour of non-Maharashtrians. The KPCL came to be\n\nimpleaded    vide       order      dated    21.2.2006,          when     the\n\nallocation was already done on 10.11.2003; there was no\n\ninterim     order       in      this       case.       The       case     in\n\nW.P.No.10788/2006            was    filed    before      this    court   on\n\n3.8.2006 challenging the Central Government Notification\n\ndated 16.7.2004 which had specified KPCL to be the end\n\nuser of coal. On 4.8.2006, stay was granted for a period\n\nof four weeks &#x27;if the impugned notification was not given\n\neffect to&#x27;; the said Notification was already given effect\n\nand therefore, there was no stay; this case came to be\n\ndismissed as withdrawn on 22.11.2006. The case in\n\nW.P.No.2923/2003 was filed before the Nagpur Bench\n\nchallenging the allocation of coal mines to the KPCL;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">however, it      too    was dismissed             on    10.8.2006; the\n\nchallenge to dismissal in SLP No.1310/2007 also met the\n\nsame      fate     on        5.4.2007.       In        the      meanwhile,\n\nW.P.No.12867/2006 came to be filed before this court on\n\n13.9.2006        challenging        the      Central         Government\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                      11</span>\n\n\n\nNotification. There was no stay order in this case; that\n\nalso came to be dismissed as withdrawn on 17.1.2007.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">      (d)        The subject Fuel Supply Agreement came to\n\nbe entered on 9.5.2007 and the present dispute concerns\n\nthe same.            Therefore, what all happened before, pales\n\ninto irrelevance. Even otherwise, petitioners have not set\n\nout the full particulars to substantiate their allegation of\n\ndelay attributable to the authorities whilst granting\n\napprovals and permissions post Agreement. Therefore\n\npetitioners&#x27; ground of attack on the impugned demand is\n\nunacceptable. The submission of petitioners that the\n\nsubject clauses of the Fuel Supply Agreement cannot be\n\ninvoked and that no amount is recoverable thereunder, is\n\nonly a futile attempt to escape the liability. As per clause\n\n2.1 of the Agreement, petitioners were obliged to deliver\n\nentire        quantity   of   coal   to    be    extracted    from      the\n\ndesignated coal mines inasmuch as they knew that BTPS\n\nwas      to     be    commissioned        by    July   2007   itself,   its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                   12</span>\n\n\n\nrequirement being approximately two million tonnes of\n\ncoal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">        (e)        The relevant clause in the subject Agreement\n\nrequired issuance of a prior notice to the KPCL within two\n\nweeks of petitioners becoming aware of any force\n\nmajeure. Despite repeated reminders, they failed to\n\nsupply coal either from the designated mines or by\n\notherwise outsourcing it. The breach of Agreement being\n\napparently demonstrable, the impugned demand has\n\nbeen raised strictly in accordance with its terms. So\n\ncontending, learned Sr. Advocate appearing for the KPCL\n\nprayed for the dismissal of Writ Petition.         He too banked\n\nupon certain Rulings in support of his submission.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">        6.

In support of this, he takes the court through\n\nseveral paragraphs of the FSA in general and paragraph\n\n10 in particular. The ground of &#x27;disputed facts&#x27; cannot be\n\nreadily invoked to deny writ remedy in deserving\n\nmatters. Almost all opponents in a petition like this\n\nwould take such a contention, needs no research. What a\n\nWrit Court has to see is: whether there is sufficient\n\nmaterial on record coupled with the pleadings of parties\n\non the basis of which disputed fact matrix can be treated\n\nfairly and with no prejudice to anyone. It hardly needs to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                            19</span>\n\n\n\nbe stated that even in large number of petitions involving\n\nviolation of Fundamental Rights, the averments are\n\nalmost invariably denied so that on this conventional\n\nground, dismissal can be secured with ease. If such a\n\nground is to be upheld, that would defeat the very\n\npurpose of incorporating <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles 226</a> <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_30\">&amp; 227</a> with a broad\n\nterminology qua <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution and in\n\ndistinction to English Law of Writs.

NOOH</a>, AIR 1958 SC\n\n86 observed &quot;...the rule requiring the exhaustion of\n\nstatutory remedies before the writ will be granted is a\n\nrule of policy, convenience, and discretion rather than a\n\nrule of law...&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">    (b)     It hardly needs to be stated that in matters\n\ninvolving the complaint of violation of Fundamental\n\nRights, a Writ Court has to invariably adjudge the case\n\non merits, disregarding the &quot;ground of disputed facts&quot;. If\n\nfacts are disputed, to adjudge the same appropriate\n\nmodes such as issuing the commission or calling of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                              20</span>\n\n\n\nreport may be adopted. Even in other matters which are\n\nanimated with considerable public law elements, a Writ\n\nCourt cannot readily deny relief to an injured litigant,\n\nmechanically quoting &quot;matter involves disputed facts&quot;,\n\nif the pleadings coupled with the evidentiary material\n\nplaced on record make due adjudication reasonably\n\npossible.    Such cases are not untouchable to the writ\n\ncourts.     That pragmatic approach would serve the spirit\n\nof jurisdiction constitutionally vested in this court. After\n\nall, the doctrine of alternate remedy which more often\n\nthan not avails to any litigant, is only a judicial invention\n\nand not a constitutional constraint; it is not a China Wall\n\nbuilt between the Writ Court and the litigants.

The right question to ask is: &#x27;whether a\n\ncontract in question involves sufficient intrinsic material\n\nthat would catapult it to the realm of public law...?&#x27; If\n\nanswer is in the affirmative, ordinarily the principles of\n\nnatural justice cannot be kept at a bay while adjudging\n\nthe breach of terms of such a contract.

That being the position, the\n\nprinciples of natural justice peep in, more particularly,\n\nwhen the petitioners had no opportunity of participation\n\nin the audit proceedings, as such; nor did the Advocate\n\nGeneral have their say in the matter when he &quot;opined for\n\nrecovery of difference in cost in respect of the entire\n\nsupply of coal arranged by KPCL from alternate source&quot;.\n\nThat opinion was based only on the material unilaterally\n\nfurnished by the KPCL.   When the impugned demand is\n\nfounded on the reports/opinions of two constitutional\n\nfunctionaries, the contention that the matter does not\n\ninvolve sufficient public law elements, is difficult to\n\ncountenance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">     (c)   Petitioners on being served with a copy of\n\nAudit Report (vide KPCL&#x27;s letter dated 11.8.2010 at\n\nAnnexure-V), had put forth their version vide letters\n\ndated 25.8.2010, 7.3.2011 &amp; 23.3.2011 explaining as to\n\nwhy the adverse Audit Objections are unsustainable.\n\nThere is no due consideration of these.

AS TO CONDONATION OF DELAY &amp; WAIVER\nOF PENALTY BEING CONDITIONAL:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">      (a)    There    is   force     in   the   submission     of\n\nMr.Srinivasa Raghavan appearing for the KPCL that the\n\npetitioners had agreed to commence supply of coal to\n\nBTPS, after its being commissioned w.e.f. 28.7.2008, the\n\ndelivery period being essence of the contract; failure to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                             32</span>\n\n\n\ndeliver accordingly, would justify KPCL&#x27;s procurement\n\nfrom alternate source at the cost of petitioners. Added,\n\npetitioners had not issued fifteen days prior notice as\n\nrequired in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 13.1</a> and therefore, the KPCL\n\nhad procured the coal. The condonation of delay &amp; waiver\n\nof penal action vide KPCL&#x27;s letter dated 25.9.2007 being\n\nconditional, petitioners cannot argue that there is no\n\nliability on their part to make reimbursement of cost of\n\nprocurement. Going by the pleadings of the parties and\n\nthe documents produced by them as Annexures, there\n\ndoes not appear to be much dispute that the KPCL\n\nprocured coal from alternate source, petitioners having\n\nfailed to supply. The action of KPCL in deducting the\n\namount payable to the petitioners towards this cost\n\ncannot be faltered because of <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 10.6</a> which reads:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;The above mentioned penalties will be recovered from\n\nany of the running bills of Supplier or could be readjusted\n\nthrough legal process.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                              33</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">      (b)    The above being said, the liability of the\n\npetitioners for their failure to supply coal would be co-\n\nterminus with the actual costs of procurement from\n\nalternate source and that no extra amount by way of\n\npenalty or otherwise, could have been levied, as rightly\n\ncontended by Mr.Sondhi. The contention of KPCL that\n\nwhere condonation of delay coupled with waiver of penal\n\naction is conditional, unless the condition is satisfied,\n\npetitioners cannot take benefit of the same, appears to\n\nbe too farfetched an argument. What is being construed\n\nis a contractual condition and not a constitutional\n\ninstrument of mandatory nature. Therefore, the true\n\nintent of subject letter needs to be ascertained from its\n\ntext &amp; context and the attending circumstances as\n\nreflected      from    the        contemporaneous   letter\n\ncorrespondences between the parties.

Added, the KPCL admits that, the petitioners\n\nstarted regular supply from 26.9.2008. It hardly needs to\n\nbe mentioned that the actual costs which the KPCL had\n\nincurred     on    account       of   procurement    of    coal     from\n\nalternate source has to be reimbursed and petitioners\n\ndisinclination to do this is not justifiable.              That being\n\nsaid, the recovery of any amount over and above the\n\nactuals being penal in nature, is impermissible.

The relevant\n\npart of the said Report reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">     &quot;In short, as against the stipulate period for\n     supply of coal in July 2007, KECML was able to\n     commence supplies only in the month of\n     September 2008 i.e., after lapse of 15 months\n     from the scheduled date of commencement f\n     supplies. This act of KECMl in non-adherence\n     to the terms and conditions of FSA and also\n     non-compliance to the obligation imposed by\n     the Company in September 2007, entailed levy\n     of penalty.    The penalty at the rate of ½\n     percent of initial contract value of Rs.330.09\n     crore for every week&#x27;s delay, from July 2007 to\n     September 2008 (15 months or 60 weeks) that\n     should have been levied form KECML worked\n     out to Rs.33.00 crore (penalty at the rate of ½\n     per cent per week worked out to Rs.99.027\n     crore, but should be limited to the maximum of\n     10 per cent per cent of contract value).\n     However, it is observed that the Company had\n     not enforced recovery of this penalty, the\n     reasons for which were not on record.

In   Service   Jurisprudence,\n\nparticipation of the delinquent employee in the enquiry is\n\none thing and supply of Inquiry Report to him is another.\n\nBoth should concur in compliance, for an inquiry to be\n\nvalid.      An inquiry sans such participation indisputably\n\nbeing bad, does not become valid by the supply of\n\nInquiry Report and by having delinquents view on that.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                             47</span>\n\n\n\nThis norm applies to the case of petitioners, as well. An\n\nargument to the contrary would be tantamount to a\n\nritualistic compliance of principles of natural justice.
