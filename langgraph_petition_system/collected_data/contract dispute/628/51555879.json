Significance of the seat of\n                                arbitration is that it determines the applicable law when\n                                deciding the arbitration proceedings and arbitration\n                                procedure as well as judicial review over the arbitration\n                                award. The situs is not just about where an institution is\n                                based or where the hearings will be held. But it is all\n                                about which court would have the supervisory power\n                                over the arbitration proceedings.                        The location of the\n                                seat will determine the courts that will have the\n                                exclusive           jurisdiction       to        oversee      the      arbitration\n                                proceedings.

Hence, it refers to a court which\n                                                  would essentially be a court of the seat of the\n                                                  arbitration process. In our opinion, the\n                                                  provision in <a href=\"/doc/574497/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 2(1)(e)</a> has to be\n                                                  construed keeping in view the provisions in\n                                                  <a href=\"/doc/385194/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 20</a> which give recognition to party\n                                                  autonomy. Accepting the narrow construction\n                                                  as projected by the learned counsel for the\n                                                  appellants would, in fact, render <a href=\"/doc/385194/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 20</a>\n                                                  nugatory. In our view, the legislature has\n                                                  intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts\n                                                  i.e. the court which would have jurisdiction\n                                                  where the cause of action is located and the\n                                                  courts where the arbitration takes place. This\n                                                  was necessary as on many occasions the\n                                                  agreement may provide for a seat of\n                                                  arbitration at a place which would be neutral\n                                                  to both the parties. Therefore, the courts\n                                                  where the arbitration takes place would be\n                                                  required to exercise supervisory control over\n                                                  the arbitral process. For example, if the\n                                                  arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of\n                                                  the parties are from Delhi, (Delhi having been\n                                                  chosen as a neutral place as between a party\n                                                  from Mumbai and the other from Kolkata) and\n                                                  the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim\n                                                  order Under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 17</a> of the Arbitration Act,\n                                                  1996, the appeal against such an interim\n                                                  order under <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 37</a> must lie to the courts\n                                                  of Delhi being the courts having supervisory\n                                                  jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings\n                                                  and the tribunal. This would be irrespective of\n                                                  the fact that the obligations to be performed\n                                                  under the contract were to be performed\n                                                  either at Mumbai or at Kolkata, and only\n                                                  arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such\n                                                  circumstances, both the courts would have\n                                                  jurisdiction i.e. the court within whose\n                                                  jurisdiction the subject-matter of the suit is\n                                                  situated and the courts within the jurisdiction\n                                                  of which the dispute resolution i.e. arbitration\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                             Page 18 of 76</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">Uploaded by BIJOY B.

This language\n                                         has to be contrasted with language such as\n                                         &quot;tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or\n                                         the parties&quot; where only hearings are to take place\n                                         in the &quot;venue&quot;, which may lead to the conclusion,\n                                         other things being equal, that the venue so stated is\n                                         not the &quot;seat&quot; of arbitral proceedings, but only a\n                                         convenient place of meeting.

This,\n                                         coupled with there being no other significant\n                                         contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a\n                                         &quot;venue&quot; and not the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral\n                                         proceedings, would then conclusively show that\n                                         such a clause designates a &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral\n                                         proceedings.

In view of the Court, the legislature had\n                                         given jurisdiction to two courts : the court which\n                                         should have jurisdiction where the cause of action\n                                         is located; and the court where the arbitration\n                                         takes place. This is necessary as, on some\n                                         occasions, the agreement may provide the &quot;seat of\n                                         arbitration&quot; that would be neutral to both the\n                                         parties. The courts where the arbitration takes\n                                         place would be required to exercise supervisory\n                                         control over the arbitral process. The &quot;seat of\n                                         arbitration&quot; need not be the place where any cause\n                                         of action has arisen, in the sense that the &quot;seat of\n                                         arbitration&quot; may be different from the place where\n                                         obligations are/had to be performed under the\n                                         contract. In such circumstances, both the courts\n                                         should have jurisdiction viz. the courts within\n                                         whose jurisdiction &quot;the subject-matter of the suit&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                                         is situated and the courts within whose jurisdiction\n                                         the dispute resolution forum, that is, where the\n                                         Arbitral Tribunal is located.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">                                         18.
