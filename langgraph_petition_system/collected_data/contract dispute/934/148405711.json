This Court\n\n\n\n\n\n        explained that to hold an award to be opposed to public\n        policy, the patent illegality should go to the very root of\n\n\n\n\n\n        the matter and not a trivial illegality. It is also observed\n        that an award could be set aside if it is so unfair and\n        unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court,\n        as then it would be opposed to public policy.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47629\" id=\"span_36\"><a href=\"/doc/47629/\" id=\"a_38\">Union of India v.
