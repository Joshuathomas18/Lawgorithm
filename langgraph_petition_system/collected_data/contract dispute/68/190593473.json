The factual matrix of the case, in hand, is that\n\nOrissa State Warehousing Corporation (OSWC) issued a\n\nnotice inviting e-tender on 30.01.2019 for appointment of\n\nregular handling and transportation contractor of food\n\ngrain stock at various locations for a period of two years.\n\nSubsequently, the Corporation issued a corrigendum to\n\nthe e-tender on 13.02.2019 with certain changes. The\n\nsaid tender notice comprised of seven zones with 21\n\nlocations and in the process the petitioner no.1 was\n\ndeclared L1 and successful bidder in respect of nine\n\nlocations, namely Jagatpur (Internal, Jatani (Internal &amp;\n\nRH), Dumerpani (Internal &amp; RH), A. Katapali (Internal &amp;\n\nRH), Nagenpali-I (Internal &amp; RH), Nagenpali-II (Internal &amp;\n\nRH), Kendpali (Internal &amp; RH), Attabira (Internal &amp; RH)\n\nand Godbhaga (Internal &amp; RH). In those nine locations,\n\nthe price and quantity of materials were different, for\n\nwhich separate agreements in the nature of work order\n\nfor specific locations were drawn for administrative\n\nconvenience. But in the work order it has been specified\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                              4</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat the terms and conditions of the MTF would be\n\napplicable. On 21.05.2019, the Corporation issued a\n\ncommon work order in favour of petitioner no.1-\n\ncontractor whereby it was to operate FCI stocks at nine\n\nlocations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\n2.1          The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued a\n\nstanding order on       07.04.2020   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_1\">Disaster\n\nManagement Act, 2005</a>, wherein it advised all States to\n\ntake urgent steps to prevent malpractices so as to ensure\n\navailability of essential goods and also advised to take\n\naction against offenders. The General Manager, FCI\n\nreported on 21.04.2020 that one rake was under loading\n\nfrom railhead Bargarh to FSD, OJM (CFDA) on the very\n\nsame day and 38 trucks loaded with Fair Average Quality\n\n(FAQ) rice stock were handed over by the Superintendent\n\nof Corporation to the Supervisor of the petitioner no.1-\n\ncontractor for transportation to the railhead Bargarh and\n\nloading to wagons. At the time of loading, it was noticed\n\nthat 200 bags of rice loaded in a truck bearing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                             5</span>\n\n\n\n\nregistration   no.   OR-17C-3923,     transit   pass   no.\n\n538/26887, dated 21.04.2020 was found to be of non-\n\nFAQ quality (i.e. sub-standard). The truck was initially\n\nloaded with FAQ rice stock, which was delivered by one\n\nM/s. Gitanjali Rice Mills, as intimated by the Divisional\n\nManager, FCI, Sambalpur. But, however, the said truck\n\narrived at railhead Bargarh containing sub-standard\n\nquality rice which got detected at the railhead point.\n\nWhen non-FAQ rice was found in the truck (OR-17C\n\n3923), it was detained and in lieu of that another truck\n\nwithout any registration number and transit pass arrived\n\nat the railhead with 200 bags of rice. The rice bags in the\n\ntruck, without registration number, were having stencil\n\nmark of Samleshwari Rice Mill with lot no. 3 &amp; 4 which\n\nwere already issued out from the State Warehousing\n\nCorporation, Kendpali on 14.04.2020, resulting in the\n\nmaterial had been replaced, for which petitioner no.1-\n\nContractor is solely responsible, as it was engaged for\n\ntransportation of materials for the godown in Kendpali to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                             6</span>\n\n\n\n\nrailway siding in Bargarh by the vehicle/trucks employed\n\nby it. The Corporation, on being intimated on 21.04.2020\n\nby the FCI, immediately lodged an FIR which was\n\nregistered as Bargarh Sadar P.S. Case No. 115/2020\n\ndated 21.04.2020 under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 420</a>/<a href=\"/doc/940928/\" id=\"a_3\">407</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_4\">120-B</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_5\">34</a>\n\nIPC and <a href=\"/doc/361626/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 7</a> of the Essential Commodities Act,\n\n1955 against petitioner no.1-contractor.\n\n\n2.2       The Corporation issued a show cause notice on\n\n22.04.2020 against the H&amp;T Contractor and called upon\n\nto explain as to why stringent measures shall not be\n\ninitiated for suspension of the H&amp;T contract of SWC,\n\nKendpali including other eight locations. So as to ensure\n\nthat there was no disruption of essential services to the\n\nneedy States due to the illegal act of the H&amp;T Contractor,\n\nthe Corporation forthwith issued a suspension order with\n\nregard to Kendpali site. Petitioner no.1-contractor gave\n\nits reply to the show cause notice dated 22.04.2020 and\n\nstated that it was duty of the FCI Railways siding in-\n\ncharge or representative of the Corporation to ascertain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                7</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe facts, verify the receipt of the materials and make\n\nnecessary entries in that regard. The duty of petitioner\n\nno.1-contractor was to transport the materials from the\n\ngodown and unload the same to the wagon at the\n\nrailways siding. Challenging the notice of show cause and\n\norder of suspension dated 22.04.2020, the petitioners\n\nmoved to this Court by filing the present writ petition.\n\n\n2.3       During pendency of this writ petition, reply of\n\nthe petitioner no.1-contractor to the show-cause notice\n\nwas thoroughly examined by a committee constituted by\n\nthe Corporation with regard to the allegations made by\n\nthe FCI. The committee observed that petitioner no.1-\n\ncontractor has committed the following irregularities:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          &quot;(i) The H &amp; T Contractor M/s.

Pursuant to report of the\n\ncommittee, the Managing Director of the Corporation\n\ninvoked Clause-XI(b) of the MTF and terminated the H&amp;T\n\ncontract of petitioner no.1-contractor for all the 9\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 9</span>\n\n\n\n\nlocations/warehouses, vide order dated 25.04.2020.

Mr. A.K. Mishra, learned counsel appearing\n\nalong with Mr. D. Mohapatra, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner argued with vehemence contending that the\n\norder of termination dated 25.04.2020 passed by the\n\nManaging      Director,      Odisha      State      Warehousing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                              12</span>\n\n\n\n\nCorporation,   Bhubaneswar        is   not   only   arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable and illegal but also suffers from gross\n\nviolation of the principles of natural justice. It is further\n\ncontended that even though there is availability of\n\nalternative remedy by way of arbitration clause, that itself\n\ncannot preclude this Court to exercise power under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It is further\n\ncontended that the allegation made against petitioner\n\nno.1-contractor relates to contract of Kendpali, but by\n\nissuing the impugned order dated 25.04.2020 all the 9\n\ncontracts have been cancelled without due compliance of\n\nthe principles of natural justice, although each contract\n\nis separate, as would be evident from the agreements and\n\nthe work orders. As such, there is no breach of terms and\n\nconditions of the contract, therefore, the termination of\n\nthe same without any rhyme or reason is illegal apart\n\nfrom being arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the\n\nprinciples of natural justice. So far it relates to contract\n\nof Kendpali, the show-cause notice did not mention the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    13</span>\n\n\n\n\nparticular clause for breach of which the notice was\n\nissued. If clause-XXI of MTF is taken into consideration\n\nas a whole, though same has been referred as part in the\n\norder of termination, no case is made out against\n\npetitioner no.1-contractor. It is further contended that\n\nthe power vested with the Managing Director in clause-XI\n\nought to be exercised judiciously. Therefore, if the action\n\ntaken   by        the   opposite    parties   is   arbitrary    and\n\nunreasonable and exercised in a contractual matter, that\n\ndeserves to be set aside. It is further contended that\n\nthough MTF contains arbitration clause, which is to be\n\nexercised by way of alternative remedy, but that itself is\n\nnot an absolute bar to adjudicate the matter in exercise\n\nof extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Article\n\n226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">             It    is   further   contended   that police      have\n\nsubmitted         charge-sheet      wherein    petitioner      no.1-\n\ncontractor has not been impleaded as accused. Rather,\n\npetitioner no.1-contractor is the whistle blower, which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                             14</span>\n\n\n\n\nhas brought the irregularities to the notice of the\n\nauthority, but it has been penalized by cancelling the\n\ncontract in respect of 9 locations. It is further contended\n\nthat for the alleged error committed in respect of one\n\nlocation at Kendpali, the termination made in respect of 9\n\nlocations is harsh. Thereby, the order impugned cannot\n\nsustain in the eye of law and the same should be\n\nquashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">           To   substantiate     his   contentions,   though\n\nseveral citations have been mentioned in the written note\n\nof arguments submitted by learned counsel for the\n\npetitioners, but specifically he has relied upon the\n\njudgments in Premier Printing Press, Jaipur v.

Mr.     A.K.     Panigrahi,      learned               counsel\n\nappearing     for   opposite     parties   no.        1       to   4    raises\n\npreliminary objection with regard to maintainability of\n\nthe writ petition, due to availability of alternative remedy\n\nof arbitration under the MTF, and contended that in view\n\nof arbitration clause-XIX of the terms and conditions of\n\nthe agreement (MTF) any dispute arising                       between the\n\ntenderers/contractors and Odisha State Warehousing\n\nCorporation concerning the contract, the same shall be\n\ndecided and resolved by way of arbitration. As such, if\n\nremedy is available under the agreement itself, the\n\npetitioners, without availing the same, could not have\n\napproached this Court by filing this writ petition. It is\n\nfurther contended that there is no violation of any of the\n\nprinciples of natural justice and more specifically, it\n\narises   out of     a   contract,      which     is       a    commercial\n\ntransaction    and,     as     such,   evaluating             tenders     and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                             16</span>\n\n\n\n\nawarding contracts are essentially commercial functions.\n\nThereby, principles of equity and natural justice stay at a\n\ndistance. If the decision relating to award of contract is\n\nbona fide and is in public interest, Courts will not, in\n\nexercise of power of judicial review, interfere even if a\n\nprocedural aberration or error in assessment or prejudice\n\nto a tenderer, is made out. The power of judicial review\n\nwill not be permitted to be invoked to protect private\n\ninterest at the cost of public interest, or to decide\n\ncontractual disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">          It is further contended that petitioner no.1-\n\ncontractor was communicated with the allegations and\n\nwas called upon to show cause. In response thereto,\n\npetitioner no.1-contractor submitted its reply, which was\n\nplaced before a committee for consideration and the\n\ncommittee finding out the irregularities suggested for\n\ntermination of contracts of petitioner no.1-contractor.\n\nConsequentially, the Managing Director passed the\n\nimpugned order of termination and, thereby, there is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 17</span>\n\n\n\n\ncompliance of principle of natural justice. As regards\n\npersonal hearing, it was not required to be given, as\n\npetitioner no.1-contractor had been given adequate\n\nopportunity to give reply to the notice of show cause. It is\n\nfurther contended that the order of termination has been\n\npassed by the Managing Director by invoking the power\n\nunder     clause-XI(b),   which       provides   for   summery\n\ntermination. Therefore, once it is a summary termination\n\nand opportunity was given to petitioner no.1-contractor\n\nto give reply to the allegations made against it, in that\n\ncase the Managing Director is well justified in passing the\n\norder impugned, which does not require interference of\n\nthis Court at this stage. It is further contended that out\n\nof 21 locations, petitioner no.1-contractor participated in\n\nrespect of 15 locations, which arose out of one tender and\n\nwas composite in nature and out of those 15 locations,\n\npetitioner no.1-contractor was selected being the L1 in\n\nrespect   of   9   locations,   and    that   though   separate\n\nagreements were executed in respect of different locations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                             18</span>\n\n\n\n\nbecause of the price, but one work order was issued in\n\nfavour of petitioner no.1-contractor. Thereby, termination\n\nof the contract in respect of 9 locations, in view of the\n\nallegations made against the location Kendpali, cannot be\n\nconstrued to be harsh. If it is a composite contract and\n\narising out of a single tender, even if error is committed\n\nin respect of one location, the tenders awarded in respect\n\nof other locations are to be set aside and accordingly, the\n\nManaging Director has passed the order impugned,\n\nwhich is well within its competence, otherwise it would\n\nhave persuaded petitioner no.1-contractor to commit\n\nfurther mistakes in respect of other locations causing\n\ndifficulties to general public who are the ultimate\n\nbeneficiaries under the PDS system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">          It is further contended that there are many\n\nfactual disputes available on record itself which are\n\nrequired to be adjudicated by invoking arbitration clause\n\narising out of the contract. More so, such disputed\n\nquestions of fact are not susceptible to judicial review\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                             19</span>\n\n\n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 226</a> of the Condition of India. As per clause-\n\nXXI, the contractor shall be responsible for the safety of\n\nthe goods while in transit in his trucks/carts/any other\n\ntransport vehicles and for delivery of quantity dispatched\n\nfrom the railhead/godowns. If said clause is alleged to be\n\nviolated, in that case petitioner no.1-conractor has to\n\nestablish that there was no such violation, which cannot\n\nbe decided in a writ petition. More so, there is no\n\nviolation of fundamental rights nor is there any violation\n\nof principle of natural justice, and the order so passed or\n\nproceedings is completely within jurisdiction of the\n\nauthority concerned. In that case, this Court should not\n\nexercise the extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 226</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">           It is further contended that much reliance has\n\nbeen placed on the charge sheet submitted in a criminal\n\nproceeding, but as a matter of fact the report submitted\n\nby the investigating officer dated 06.07.2020 is not\n\nconclusive and it is still open to the Magistrate to take\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                             20</span>\n\n\n\n\ncognizance under <a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 190</a> Cr.P.C. by rejecting the\n\nopinion of the investigating officer and, as such, these\n\nopposite parties have a right to raise protest against such\n\nreport and, thereby, no conclusion can be drawn with\n\nregard to the report submitted by the investigating officer.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">          It is further contended that clause XI(b) of the\n\ncontract, by which the Managing Director has been\n\nvested with the power to terminate the contract which is\n\nsummary in nature, was examined and upheld by the\n\nDelhi High Court, therefore, the contention raised that\n\nthe power invoked by the Managing Director is arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable and contrary to the provisions of law,\n\ncannot sustain in the eye of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"60084250\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86075327\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"118375\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1885496\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1547105\" id=\"span_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"146451\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1979603\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"868968\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"196344595\" id=\"span_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"961662\" id=\"span_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"139043673\" id=\"span_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"899938\" id=\"span_32\">Although     various      judgments   have   been\n\nreferred to in the written note of submissions, but in\n\ncourse of argument he has relied upon the judgments in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/899938/\" id=\"a_12\">Jagdish Mandal v.

Mr. D.

If at all the petitioners\n\nseeks relief, the same is against opposite parties no.1 to\n\n4, who entered into the contract with petitioner no.1-\n\nconractor and have legal relationship. Thereby, the writ\n\npetition, so far as opposite party no.5 is concerned,\n\nshould be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">          It is further contended that opposite party no.5\n\nis a statutory Corporation established under the Food\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                 23</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/644473/\" id=\"a_26\">Corporation Act, 1964</a> and a nodal organization of the\n\nGovernment of India to implement the National Food\n\nPolicy to ensure delivery of food grains to every corner of\n\nthe whole of India through public distribution system. To\n\nfulfill and maintain the above objectives, FCI has to store\n\nand facilitate movement of food grains across the\n\ncountry. The storage of food grains is also effected by\n\nentering     into   contracts   with   Central   Warehousing\n\nCorporation (CWC) and State Warehousing Corporations\n\n(SWCs). Thereby, the FCI hires storage space in the\n\ngodowns/warehouses of the CWC or the SWCs for\n\nstorage of food grains and also hires their handling and\n\ntransport.     Therefore,   FCI,     CWC   and    SWCs   are\n\nindependent contractors. The petitioner-firm was involved\n\nin handling and transportation of FCI rice stock stored in\n\nthe OSWC godowns at 9 different locations across the\n\nState of Odisha, including the OSWC godown at Kendpali\n\nfrom where rice was being transported to West Bengal\n\nfrom Bargarh railhead on 21.04.2020, pursuant to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                             24</span>\n\n\n\n\nCentral Government&#x27;s directions, to mitigate any risk of\n\nshortage of food grains in the country due to COVID-19\n\npandemic. During supervision of the rake operation at\n\nthe Bargarh railhead to transport the FCI rice stock on\n\n21.04.2020 by the concerned FCI officials, it was noticed\n\nthat there was a shortage of 200 full bags of rice and that\n\nthe quality of rice in one truck was sub-standard. After\n\nthe preliminary enquiries, it was established prima facie\n\nthat the entire stock in the truck had been replaced along\n\nthe way with sub-standard rice by petitioner no.1-\n\nconractor.     When        petitioner     no.1-conractor&#x27;s\n\nrepresentative on site was informed on such facts, he\n\nbrought another un-numbered truck loaded with rice\n\nbags claiming the same to be the original stock. It was\n\nalso discovered during inspection that the sub-standard\n\nstock brought on 21.04.2020 in truck number OR-17-C-\n\n3923 contained bags from a lot of rice stock that had\n\nalready been dispatched on 14.04.2020. The original rice\n\nstocks were replaced by some other stock that had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                             25</span>\n\n\n\n\nescaped detection on the very same day. Basing on this\n\ninformation, the OSWC, with whom the FIC had entered\n\ninto a contract for storage of FCI stock and their handling\n\nand transportation, filed an FIR and follow up action was\n\ntaken by terminating the contract of petitioner no.1-\n\nconractor.    It is further contended that the action so\n\ntaken against petitioner no.1-conractor by opposite\n\nparties no.1 to 4 cannot be said to be illegal, which may\n\nnot be interfered with in this proceeding.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">6.

In Bridge &amp; Roof Company (India) Ltd.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">(supra), the apex Court in paragraph-21 held as\n\nfollows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">             &quot;There is yet another substantial reason for not\n            entertaining the writ petition. The contract in\n            question contains a clause providing inter a1ia for\n            settlement of disputes by reference to arbitration\n            [Clause 67 of the Contract]. The Arbitrators can\n            decide both questions of fact as well as questions\n            of law. When the contract itself provides for a\n            mode of settlement of disputes arising from\n            the contract, there is no reason why the\n            parties should not follow and adopt that\n            remedy and invoke the extra-ordinary\n            jurisdiction of the High Court under Article\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">            226. The existence of an effective alternative\n            remedy - in this case, provided in the contract\n            itself - is a good ground for the court to\n            decline     to    exercise    its  extra-ordinary\n            jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 226.</a> The said Article\n            was not meant to supplant the existing remedies at\n            law but only to supplement them in certain well-\n            recognised situations. As pointed out above, the\n            prayer for issuance of a writ of mandamus was\n            wholly misconceived in this case since the\n            respondent was not seeking to enforce any\n            statutory right of theirs nor was it seeking to\n            enforce any statutory obligation cast upon the\n            appellants. Indeed, the very resort to <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 226 -</a>\n             whether for issuance of mandamus or any other\n            writ, order or direction - was misconceived for the\n            reasons mentioned supra.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                               35</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">14.       The law <a href=\"/doc/1979603/\" id=\"a_45\">laid down by</a> the apex Court clearly\n\nindicates that when a contract provides for resolving the\n\ndispute arising out of a contract, there is no reason why\n\nthe party should not follow and adopt that remedy and\n\ninvoke the extra ordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 226</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India. The existence and effect of\n\nalternative remedy in the present case is provided in the\n\ncontract itself under clause-XIX(b)(i). Therefore, there is\n\nno justifiable reason to interfere with the same by\n\ninvoking extra-ordinary jurisdiction of this Court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">15.       In Sudhir Kumar Singh mentioned supra, the\n\napex Court clearly laid down the principles of natural\n\njustice summarized as follows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">          &quot;The principles of natural justice can be\n          summarised as follows: (i) it is a flexible tool in\n          the hands of the judiciary to reach out in fit\n          cases to remedy injustice. The breach of\n          the audi alteram partem rule cannot by itself,\n          without more, lead to the conclusion that\n          prejudice is thereby caused. (ii) Where\n          procedural and/or substantive provisions of\n          law embody the principles of natural justice,\n          their infraction per se does not lead to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                              36</span>\n\n\n\n\n          invalidity of the orders passed. The prejudice\n          must be caused to the litigant, except in the\n          case of a mandatory provision of law which is\n          conceived not only in individual interest but\n          also in public interest. (iii) No prejudice is\n          caused to the person complaining of the breach\n          of natural justice where such person does not\n          dispute the case against him or it. This can\n          happen by reason of estoppel, acquiescence,\n          waiver and by way of non-challenge or non-\n          denial or admission of facts, in cases in which\n          the court finds on facts that no real prejudice\n          can be said to have been caused to the person\n          complaining of the breach of natural justice. (iv)\n          In cases where facts can be stated to be\n          admitted or indisputable, and only one\n          conclusion is possible, the court does not pass\n          futile orders of setting aside or remand when\n          there is, in fact, no prejudice caused. This\n          conclusion must be drawn by the court on an\n          appraisal of the facts of a case, and not by the\n          authority who denies natural justice to a\n          person. (v) The prejudice exception must be\n          more than a mere apprehension or even a\n          reasonable suspicion of a litigant. It should\n          exist as a matter of fact or be based upon a\n          definite inference of likelihood of prejudice\n          flowing from the non-observance of natural\n          justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">16.       In the facts of the present case, it cannot be\n\nsaid that there was breach of natural justice. Therefore, it\n\nwould be futile to exercise the writ jurisdiction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. As a matter of\n\nfact, in the present case, when irregularities were brought\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                              37</span>\n\n\n\n\nto the notice of the authority, consequentially show cause\n\nwas called for from petitioner no.1-contractor, who in\n\nresponse thereto submitted reply, and the matter was\n\nplaced before the committee for adjudication. Thereafter,\n\nthe committee, after due adjudication, came to a\n\nconclusion    that   irregularities   were    committed     by\n\npetitioner no.1-contractor and on that basis invoking\n\nclause-XI(b) the Managing Director has passed the order\n\nimpugned. It is of relevance to note that nomenclature of\n\nclause-XI    is   &quot;summary        termination&quot;.   The     word\n\n&quot;summary&quot; prefixed to &quot;termination&quot; has got its own\n\nmeaning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">17.         As per Webster Dictionary, &quot;summary&quot; is\n\ndefined to mean short, concise, reduced into a narrow\n\ncompass or into a few words.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">            In Mohanlal v. Kartar Singh, (1995) Supp.\n\n(4) SCC 684, the apex Court held that the word\n\n&#x27;summary&#x27; implies a short and quick procedure instead of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                             38</span>\n\n\n\n\nor, as an alternative to, the more elaborate procedure\n\nordinarily adopted or prescribed for deciding a case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">18.       In the above premises, this Court is of the\n\nconsidered view that since disputed questions of fact are\n\ninvolved in the matter and more so the matter arises out\n\nof a contract and, as such, when the contract itself\n\nprovides a forum for adjudication by way of reference to\n\narbitrator, this Court should refrain from exercising the\n\nextraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">19.       In the facts and circumstances of the case as\n\nwell as the settled position of law, as discussed above,\n\nsince there is availability of an alternative efficacious\n\nremedy available to the petitioner, this Court, without\n\nexpressing any opinion on the merits, disposes of the writ\n\npetition permitting the petitioners to approach the\n\nappropriate forum, by availing alternative remedy under\n\nthe contract itself, in accordance with law.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                39</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">20.
