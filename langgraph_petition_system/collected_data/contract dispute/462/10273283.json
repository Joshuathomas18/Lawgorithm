On due consideration of the arguments of\nthe learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner, firstly,\nthe contract between the parties is a contract in the\nrealm of private law. It is governed by the provisions\nof the contract Act or may be,also by certain\nprovisions of the sale of Goods Act. Any dispute\nrelating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of\nsuch a contract cannot be agitated, and could not\nhave been agitated, in a writ petition. That is a matter\neither for arbitration as provided by the contract or for\nCivil court as the case may be and the further\nquestion whether retention or refusal to pay any\namount by the Government is justified, or not are all\nmatters which cannot be agitated in or adjudicated\nupon in a writ petition.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                Writ Petition No.13719/2019</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                             - 15 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">             10. Accordingly, the writ petition filed by the\n      petitioners restraining the respondents from taking\n      any adverse action against him is wholly\n      misconceived and is not maintainable in law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">             11. There is yet another substantial reason for\n      not entertaining the writ petition. The contract in\n      question contains a clause providing inter alia for\n      settlement of disputes by reference to arbitration. The\n      Arbitrators can decide both questions of fact as well\n      as questions of law. When the contract itself provides\n      for a mode of settlement of disputes arising from the\n      contract, there is no reason why the parties should\n      not follow and adopt that remedy and invoke the\n      extra-ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226.</a> The existence of an effective alternative\n      remedy - in this case, provided in the contract itself -\n      is a good ground for the court to decline to exercise\n      its extra-ordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226.</a> The\n      said Article was not meant to supplant the existing\n      remedies at law but only to supplement them in\n      certain well-recognized situations. As pointed out\n      above, the prayer of the petitioner is wholly\n      misconceived.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      13. The contract in question between the parties is\n      a contract in the realm of private law. It is governed by\n      the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_16\">Indian Contract Act</a>. The dispute\n      relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of\n      such contract cannot be adjudicated in a writ petition.\n      That is a matter of either for arbitration as provided by\n      the contract as the arbitrator can decide both the\n      questions of fact as well as questions of law. The\n      petitioner is not seeking to enforce any statutory right\n      of theirs nor he was seeking to enforce any statutory\n      obligation cast upon the respondents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">5.     In the case of S. Singh &amp; Company Vs. State of M.P.\n(W.P.

In the matter of black listing or suspending the\n      registration of a contractor, a writ court exercising\n      jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution has a\n      very limited role to play. It is only to be seen as to\n      whether proper opportunity of hearing before taking\n      the impugned action is granted and the requirement\n      of the principles of natural justice followed. What is\n      subjected to judicial review in such cases is only the\n      decision making process and not the decision itself.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">      Judicial review in such cases is limited to extent to\n      see as to whether the decision taken is so perverse or\n      arbitrary in nature that the Wednesbury theory of\n      reasonableness get attracted.

As far as second ground with regard to handing\n      over site after land acquisition and payment of\n      compensation is concerned, it is found that upto\n      27.5.2012, 1.6.2012, 8.6.2012, 25.12.2012 more than\n      8000 to 11310 running meters of area were made\n      available, layout for the same was also provided.\n      There was no complaint either to the department or\n      the police authority with regard to any obstruction by\n      the agriculturists with regard to this area and\n      authorities found that when 8000 to 11310 running\n      meters were made available and no work was started,\n      the complaint of the petitioner that delay is caused\n      due to availability of land is found to be unsustainable.\n      If the reasonings given by the authorities as are\n      indicated in the order, particularly the appellate\n      authority as indicated above, is taken note of, we find\n      that contention of the petitioner as is made out in the\n      writ petition to say that the drawings were made\n      available to him only 4 days prior to the period of 12\n      months, therefore the work could not be completed\n      seems to be incorrect. On the contrary, departmental\n      submissions and the findings of the appellate\n      authority go to show that adequate land, maps and\n      drawings were provided to the petitioner and even this\n      work was not satisfactorily concluded. This being the\n      reasons which have come on record, we are of the\n      considered view that this is not a fit case where we\n      can take a different view and interfere. We see no\n      error apparent on the face of record in the order of the\n      appellate authority on the decision taken by the\n      department. In this case the requirement of the\n      principles of natural justice has been followed and\n      based on material available a reasonable decision\n      has been taken which cannot be termed as perverse\n      to the extent that a prudent man approach is not\n      undertaken, the respondents have considered the\n      matter in accordance with requirement of law and\n      now, we see no ground to interfere into the matter.\n      That apart, the question involved in the matter with\n      regard to making available the land and the drawings\n      is also a disputed question of fact which cannot be\n      adjudicated by us in these proceedings. Ultimately, if\n      the Arbitration Tribunal where the dispute is sub-\n      judice comes to a conclusion and gives a finding that\n      termination of contract was illegal, the petitioner can\n      always claim damages.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">6.

The law relating to invocation of bank guarantees is by\n      now well settled by a catena of decisions of this court. The bank\n      guarantees which provided that they are payable by the\n      guarantor on demand is considered to be an un-conditional bank\n      guarantee. When in the course of commercial dealings,\n      unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted the\n      beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms\n      thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. In U.P. State Sugar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                 Writ Petition No.13719/2019</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">                              - 20 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_42\"><a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_26\">Corporation vs. Sumac International Ltd.</a>, this court observed\nthat : (SCC p.574, para 12)\n               &quot;The law relating to invocation of such bank\n       guarantees is by now well settled. When in the course of\n       commercial dealings an unconditional bank guarantee is\n       given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize\n       such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of\n       any pending disputes. The bank giving such a guarantee\n       is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any\n       dispute raised by its customer. The very purpose of giving\n       such a bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The\n       courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an injunction\n       to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee. The\n       courts have carved out only two exceptions. A fraud in\n       connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the\n       very foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there\n       is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take\n       advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. The\n       second exception relates to cases where allowing the\n       encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would\n       result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the\n       parties concerned. Since in most cases payment of\n       money under such a bank guarantee would adversely\n       affect the bank and its customer at whose instance the\n       guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated\n       under this head must be of such an exceptional and\n       irretrievable nature as would over ride the terms of the\n       guarantee and the adverse effect of such an injunction on\n       commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds are\n       not necessarily connected, though both may coexist in\n       some cases.µ&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">        12. It is equally well settled in law that bank guarantee is\nan independent contract between bank and the beneficiary\nthereof. The bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as\nlong as it is an unconditional and irrevocable one. The dispute\nbetween the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the\nbank has given the guarantee is immaterial and of no\nconsequence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_43\">In <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_27\">BSES Limited vs. Fenner India Ltd.</a> this court\nheld : (SCC pp. 733-34, para 10)\n       &quot;10. There are, however, two exceptions to this Rule. The\n       first is when there is a clear fraud of which the Bank has\n       notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks\n       to benefit. The fraud must be of an egregious nature as to\n       vitiate the entire underlying transaction. The second\n       exception to the general rule of non- intervention is when\n       there are special equitiesµ in favour of injunction, such as\n       when irretrievable injuryµ or irretrievable injusticeµ would\n       occur if such an injunction were not granted.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_44\">The general\n       rule and its exceptions has been reiterated in so many\n       judgments of this court, that in <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_28\">U.P.

The respondent, therefore, cannot be allowed to\n             raise any dispute and prevent the appellant from\n             encashing the bank guarantee.

Such judicial\nadventurism cannot be permitted and we strongly\ndeprecate the tendency of the subordinate courts in not\napplying the settled principles and in passing whimsical\norders which necessarily has the effect of granting\nwrongful and unwarranted relief to one of the parties. It is\ntime that this tendency stops.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">       33. Before concluding we think it appropriate to\nmention about the conduct of the respondent - bank\nwhich has chosen not to be in this case. From the facts\nstated hereinabove it appears to us that the respondent\nbank has not shown professional efficiency, to say the\nleast, and has acted in a partisan manner with a view to\nhelp and assist respondent no. 1. At the time when there\nwas no restraint order from any Court, the bank was\nunder a legal and moral obligation to honour its\ncommitments. It, however, failed to do so. It appears that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                  Writ Petition No.13719/2019</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">                              - 24 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">       the bank deliberately dragged its feet so as to enable\n       respondent no.1 to secure favourable order of injunction\n       from the Court. Such conduct of a bank is difficult to\n       appreciate We do not wish to say anything more but it\n       may feel that it will be prejudicial in the event of the\n       appellant taking action against it.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"636783\" id=\"span_54\">17. Keeping in view the aforesaid judgment delivered by\nthe apex court and also keeping in view the fact that the bank\nguarantee it is unconditional and irrecoverable, this court is of\nthe considered opinion that the learned District Judge has rightly\nrejected the injunction application, keeping in view the judgment\ndelivered in the case of <a href=\"/doc/636783/\" id=\"a_34\">Dwarikesh Sugar Vs. Prem Heavy Engg</a>\n(supra), it is not a case where a fraud has taken place or a bank\nguarantee was obtained by coercion and, therefore, in absence\nof established fraud and keeping in view the bank guarantee, the\ntrial court has rightly declined prayer for grant of injunction and\nfrom restraining the respondents from encashment of the bank\nguarantee.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"48888943\" id=\"span_55\">18.

Keeping in view the aforesaid, as no primafacie case\nwas established before the trial court nor balance of\nconvenience was established before the trial court and no\nirreparable damages was established before the trial court, the\ntrial court has rightly declined to grant injunction in the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1518031\" id=\"span_56\">20.

We are, however, unable to accept the\n       submissions of the learned Senior Counsel that the bank\n       guarantee must be construed in the light of other\n       purported contemporaneous documents. A contract\n       indisputably may be contained in more than one\n       document. Such a document, however, must be a subject\n       matter of contract by and between the parties. The\n       correspondences referred to hereinbefore were between\n       the cooperative society and Pentagon. The said\n       correspondences were not exchanged between the\n       parties hereto as a part of the same transaction. The\n       Appellant understood that it would stand as a surety and\n       not as a guarantor.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_58\">21. Keeping in view the aforesaid this court is of the\nconsidered opinion that merely because parties have entered\ninto an agreement and later on Bank guarantees have been\nfurnished, it does not mean that its a conditional bank guarantee.\nThe bank guarantee, whether it is conditional bank guarantee or\nunconditional bank guarantee ? whether it is a revocable or\nirrevocable ? has to be seen by going through the relevant\nclause mentioned in the bank guarantee itself and, therefore, in\nthe present case as the bank guarantees are not conditional nor\nrevocable, the question of restraining the respondents from\nencashing the bank guarantees does not arise. Not only this, it is\na well settled proposition of law that a bank guarantee is a\ncontract between the bank and beneficiaries as held by the apex\ncourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_37\">Vinitec Electronics (P) Ltd., Vs. HCL\nInfosystems Ltd.</a>,reported in (2008) 1 SCC 544. The apex court\nin the aforesaid case has held as under :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">      &quot;12. It is equally well settled in law that bank guarantee is\n      an independent contract between bank and the\n      beneficiary thereof. The bank is always obliged to honour\n      it guarantee as long as it is an unconditional and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                   Writ Petition No.13719/2019</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">                               - 26 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">       irrevocable one. The dispute between the beneficiary and\n       the party at whose instance the bank has given the\n       guarantee is immaterial and of no consequence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_60\">In <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_38\">BSES\n       Ltd. V. Fenner India Ltd.</a> this Court held :(SCC pp. 733-34,\n       para 10)\n       &quot;10. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule. The\n       first is when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has\n       notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks to\n       benefit. The fraud must be of an egregious nature as to\n       vitiate the entire underlying transaction. The second\n       exception to the general rule of non-intervention is when\n       there are &#x27;special equities&#x27; in favour of injunction, such as\n       when &#x27;irretrievable injury&#x27; or &#x27;&#x27;irretrievable injustice&#x27; would\n       occur if such an injunction were not granted.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_61\">The general\n       rule and its exceptions has been reiterated in so many\n       judgments of this Court, that in <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_39\">U.P.

This court is of the considered opinion that in the\npresent case also the bank guarantee is an independent contract\nbetween the Bank and the respondent No.1. It is unconditional\nirrevocable one and therefore the learned District Judge was\njustified in dismissing the injunction application. Not only this, this\nis a case wherein the present appellant has categorically stated\nin the memo of appeal as well as at various other places that the\noutstanding amount of Rs. 182 crores has to be paid to the\nrespondent No.1. It has also been stated that they have not\ndisputed the amount, though it is an illegal demand. The bank\nguarantees are amounting to only about 96 lacs only, which is\ncertainly less than the admitted amount. The balance of\nconvenience is infact in encashment of the bank guarantees.\nThe learned District Judge has not committed any jurisdictional\nerror nor the order suffers from any patent illegality and therefore\nthis court does not find any reason to interfere with the order\npassed by the learned District Judge.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_100\">        23. Before closing the matter, this court would like to\nobserve that in the present case a caveat has been filed by the\nrespondent No.1. The noting made by the Registry reflects that\nthe caveat was on record. However, the respondent No.1 against\nwhom injunction has been sought has not been heard while\npassing an interim order. However, as matter has now been\nfinally decided by dismissing the present appeal, the respondent\nBank is directed to encash the bank guarantees forthwith.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_101\">       24.
