It further challenges the Order dated 28.12.2020\n\n          in Review Petition No. 682 of 2020. By the said Judgment\n\n          in the Writ Petition, the High Court allowed the Writ\n\n          Petition filed by the first respondent and quashed the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Jagdish Kumar</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2022.11.16</span>\n\n          Order\n17:24:39 IST\nReason:                     dated    07.07.2018,   which   was   passed   by   the\n\n          appellant, terminating the Power Purchase Agreement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                   1</span>\n\f(hereinafter referred to as ‘the PPA’, for short),\n\nwhich was entered into by the appellant and the first\n\nrespondent. The review filed by the appellant was\n\ndismissed. Hence the appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\nTHE FACTS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.   The appellant, which is “a wholly owned company of\n\nthe Government of Madhya Pradesh” (as described by the\n\nappellant        in    the   Special      Leave    Petition),     is\n\nresponsible for the bulk purchase of electricity in the\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh for onward sale/supply to the\n\ndistribution utilities (DISCOMS). The appellant issued\n\na request for proposal (RFP) dated 06.05.2015 for long-\n\nterm procurement of 300 MW of solar energy through\n\ntariff-based competitive bidding. The bid of M/s Sky\n\nPower Southeast Asia Holding Limited was accepted. It\n\nwas declared the successful bidder for three units of\n\n50   MW   each    at   different       tariff   rates.   The   bidder\n\nsubsequently incorporated the first respondent, viz.,\n\nM/s Sky Power Southeast Solar India Private Limited as\n\na special purpose company. This was for developing one\n\nproject of 50 MW. The rate, which is applicable in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                   2</span>\n\frespect of the first respondent, was Rs.5.109 per unit.\n\nIn   respect    of   the    other       two    bids,   the    bidder\n\nincorporated other companies, viz., M/s Sky Power Solar\n\nIndia Private Limited and M/s Sky Power Southeast Asia\n\nOne Private Limited. The rates applicable in respect\n\nof said companies for the other two projects consisting\n\nof 50 MW each was Rs.5.298 per unit and Rs.5.051 per\n\nunit,   respectively.       The   PPA    was    entered      into    on\n\n18.09.2015. The agreement, inter alia, provided for\n\npre-commissioning activities. They are described as\n\nsatisfaction of conditions subsequent by the seller.\n\nThe first respondent is the seller under the PPA.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.   The   Agreement    contemplated          completion     of     the\n\nconditions subsequent, within a period of 210 days. In\n\nother words, the Agreement, admittedly, provided that\n\nthe first respondent was to achieve fulfilment of\n\nconditions     subsequent    by   15.04.2016.      The     Agreement\n\nfurther contemplates an extension of the period of\n\nfulfilment of the condition subsequent on payment of\n\npenalty for a further period of nine months. Thus,\n\ncalculating 210 days and an additional nine months from\n\n18.09.2015, which is the date of the PPA, the period\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  3</span>\n\fwould come to an end on 15.01.2017. A communication was\n\naddressed dated 12.01.2017 by the first respondent. The\n\nfirst respondent purported to refer to <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 2.1</a> of\n\nthe PPA, which, inter alia, reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     “Article 2.1 Seller agrees and undertaken to\n     duly perform and complete all of the following\n     activities seller&#x27;s own cost and risk within\n     210 days from the effective Date unless such\n     completion is affected by any force Majeure\n     event, or if any of the Effective is\n     specifically waived in writing by MPPMCL:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     a) The Seller shall obtain all Consents,\n     Clearance and Permits required for supply of\n     Power to MPPMCL as per the terms of this\n     Agreement;”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">5.   The first respondent purported to present certain\n\ndocuments and contend that there was compliance of its\n\nobligations under the PPA. This led to communication\n\ndated 22.02.2017 addressed by the appellant to the\n\nfirst respondent. It referred to the status of the\n\ndocuments,   which   the   appellant   noted.   Furthermore,\n\nappellant sought certain documents. It is, inter alia,\n\npointed out by the appellant that the first respondent\n\nhad no documents in regard to 34.12 hectare of land and\n\nan unregistered lease deed for only 12 months was\n\nsubmitted, which could not be considered as fulfilment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                             4</span>\n\fof the condition subsequent. Thereafter, it was stated\n\nthat the PPA is liable to be terminated in terms of\n\nArticle 2.5.1 of the PPA. Explanation/justification if\n\nany was called for from the first respondent. Acting\n\non the request of the first respondent, the appellant\n\ngranted time for response of the first respondent till\n\n10.03.2017.   The   response,    which   was   given    on\n\n10.03.2017, reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     “Firstly, we are thrilled to update you that\n     the project is under advanced construction and\n     all equipment order for the project have been\n     placed and construction happening on site we\n     expect that the project will be top quality\n     using the best equipment in the market and\n     constructed by a top-tier EPC, for the benefit\n     of both Sky Power and the state of MP.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     1.

After a gap of nearly five months, the next date,\n\nwhich is invoked by the appellant, is 09.08.2017. It\n\nis   the   case   of    the   appellant     that   as   the    first\n\nrespondent had failed to comply with the conditions\n\nsubsequent, by misrepresentation and manipulation, it\n\npurported to obtain approval from the Chief Electrical\n\nInspector General (CEIG) under Regulation 32 of the\n\nCentral Electricity Authority (Measures relating to\n\nsafety and electricity supply) Regulation, 2010 read\n\nwith    Section   162    of    the   Act.    According    to      the\n\nappellant, the Report of the CEIG came to the knowledge\n\nof the appellant on 20.08.2017. Prior to the said date,\n\nthe appellant purported to terminate the PPA in terms\n\nof Article 2.5.1(d) of the PPA, considering it to be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                7</span>\n\fmandatory by communication dated 11.08.2017. In short,\n\naccording to the appellant, as the maximum period,\n\nwithin which, the conditions subsequent, had to be\n\nfulfilled, had run out on 15.01.2017, under the PPA,\n\nthe appellant had no other option but to terminate the\n\nAgreement. This led to the first Writ Petition filed\n\nby the first respondent. The said Writ Petition, viz.,\n\nWrit Petition No. 12880 of 2017, came to be allowed by\n\nthe   High   Court   by   Judgment   dated   20.06.2018.   The\n\nrelevant portion of the Judgment reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      “2.     The contract has been terminated on\n      account of 54 days delay in achieving the first\n      milestone i.e., procurement of land, financial\n      closure and necessary permissions from the\n      competent authority within 2 I 0 days from the\n      date of execution of agreement for completing\n      the first part of the project. The only reason\n      to terminate the agreement is that the\n      petitioner   has   failed   to   achieve   first\n      milestone within 210 days though the condition\n      of - procurement of land was modified after 210\n      days on 20.04.2016.

Mr. Kaurav sought to justify the termination\n     of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) asserting\n     that the petitioner has not commissioned the\n     power project within the time fixed in the\n     agreement, but the lack of commissioning of\n     power project is not the reason for terminating\n     of the contract. Since, such is not the reason\n     mentioned   in   the   order   terminating   the\n     agreement, therefore, the respondents cannot\n     supplement the reasons for termination of the\n     contract by virtue of additional assertions in\n     the return and/or in the arguments raised in\n     view of the Supreme Court decision in <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_4\">Mohinder\n     Singh Gill v.

Thereafter         the    appellant    in\n\nSeptember, 2020 filed review petition which came to be\n\ndismissed by the second impugned order. On 15.04.2021\n\nthis    court   issued    notice          and   stayed    the    impugned\n\norders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">9.     We have heard Mr. K.M.

Shri    K.M.    Natraj,      learned        Additional      Solicitor\n\nGeneral submits that the impugned judgments are clearly\n\nunsustainable. He would firstly point out that the writ\n\npetition    filed    by        the    first       respondent     is   not\n\nmaintainable. The PPA in question is not a statutory\n\ncontract and therefore interference with the order\n\nterminating the contract was not justifiable.                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"318728\" id=\"span_18\">In this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     10</span>\n\fregard he drew support from the judgment of this Court\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/318728/\" id=\"a_6\">Kerala State Electricity Board and Another v. Kurien\n\nE. Kalathil and Others1</a>.           He would next contend that\n\nthe PPA contemplated provisions to resolve disputes.\n\nHe further contended that first respondent should have\n\nresorted, if at all, to a civil suit to claim redress.\n\nHe pointed out that a writ petition is a public law\n\nremedy. The contract in question not being statutory\n\nin nature, there was no public law element so as to\n\njustify the approach under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 226.</a> He would next\n\ncontend that there is no basis for the High Court to\n\nhave interfered at all. This is a case where broadly\n\nthe contract contemplated fulfilment of conditions at\n\ntwo    stages.   The    first      stage   related        to   various\n\nconditions    that     had   to   be   fulfilled     by    the   first\n\nrespondent which are described as conditions subsequent\n\nin the PPA. They are also aptly described as the pre-\n\ncommissioning    stage.      The    PPA    clearly    contemplated\n\nfulfilment of these conditions on an indisputable basis\n\non or before 15.01.2017. In arriving at this date, the\n\nmaximum period of 9 months contemplated under the PPA\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">1</span>\n    (2000) 6 SCC 293\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                  11</span>\n\fas the period which can be extended on payment of\n\npenalty is also included. However, the first respondent\n\ndid not fulfil the conditions subsequent except with a\n\nfurther delay of 56 days. The PPA clearly provides that\n\nif the time limit is exceeded which in this case was\n\n15.01.2017, the appellant shall terminate the contract.\n\nThis is not a question of power or a discretion. This\n\nis a right which inhered with the appellant, a party\n\nto a contract. In this regard he would emphasise that\n\nwhile the State may be burdened with the obligation to\n\nact in a fair manner, it does not take away the rights\n\navailable to the State as a party to a contract to\n\nexercise the right with it under the contract. In other\n\nwords, the appellant as State within the meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 12</a> should not be denied the very right which\n\ncould be duly exercised by a private party if it stood\n\nin the shoes of the appellant in similar circumstances.\n\nThis is all that has been done by the appellant. Coming\n\nto the second   stage, namely, commissioning of the\n\nproject by the first respondent, our attention was\n\ndrawn to <a href=\"/doc/817828/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 2.6</a> of the PPA. He contended that\n\nagreement contemplated commissioning of plant within\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                          12</span>\n\f12    months   from       the     date    of    the   financial    closure\n\nsubject to Force Majeure. He would point out that there\n\nwere no circumstances for invoking Force Majeure. The\n\nperiod of 12 months from the date of financial closure\n\ndetermined      the        maximum       period       within    which      the\n\ncommissioning had to take place. He would submit that\n\nfirst respondent was in breach of even commissioning.\n\nTherefore,          on     that        score     also,    there       is    no\n\njustification for the High Court to have interfered in\n\nthe matter. He would further submit that there is\n\nanother vital circumstance which should have dissuaded\n\nthe High Court from granting relief. The case threw up\n\ndisputed questions of facts. On the one hand, it was\n\nthe   case     of    the       first    respondent,      that   the     first\n\nrespondent had proceeded to do everything within the\n\ntime which is a period of two years from 18.09.2015,\n\nthe date of the PPA, and it was only if commissioning\n\nwas not done within the said period that what is\n\ndescribed in the agreement as Seller’s default occurs.\n\nHere is a case where the first respondent had not\n\nactually       on        the    ground         carried   out      necessary\n\ninstallation. In this regard, he would contend that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                        13</span>\n\fwhile the CEIG has given its approval, the approval was\n\ngranted without the first respondent having complied\n\nits obligations under the contract. In this regard\n\nessentially two aspects are projected. It is firstly\n\npointed out that while the first writ petition was\n\npending consideration, the appellant carried out an\n\ninspection     on     19.04.2018.     A   report      ensued   on\n\n21.04.2018. It was revealed that the approval which is\n\ngranted by the CEIG may not advance the case of the\n\nfirst respondent as certain lacunae emerged. It was\n\nfound by the inspecting team of the appellant that in\n\nthe blocks 9 and 10 (the project of 50MW consisted of\n\n10 blocks of 5 MW each), 61 inverters were missing. It\n\nwas further revealed that in regard to 258 invertors,\n\nthere was duplication of numbers. In other words,\n\nwithout there being the professed numbers of invertors\n\nas required under the contract, the approval of the\n\nCEIG was procured. In fact, this aspect, which when it\n\nwas discovered by the appellant, formed the foundation\n\nfor   the    review    petition     but   was   not   favourably\n\nconsidered by the High Court. A writ petition in the\n\nfacts of this case would not lie. He would submit that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                              14</span>\n\fwhile a writ petition may be maintainable when the\n\nState is awarding its largesse in the form of award of\n\ncontract, once it enters into a contract there would\n\narise no occasion for the court to do judicial review\n\nand strike it down. Action taken by the state as\n\ncontracting party when it is within the four walls of\n\nthe contract is immune in public law proceedings. That\n\nan action may lie for breach of contract where the\n\naggrieved party can seek damages should have weighed\n\nwith the court. He would further contend that there is\n\nyet another dimension which has been overlooked by the\n\nHigh Court. The overwhelming public interest in the\n\nfacts of this case did not favour the writ court\n\ninterfering in the matter. In this regard he would\n\nexpatiate by pointing out that the interference by the\n\nHigh Court will produce the following results:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">        The PPA casts an obligation on the appellant\n\n   to purchase power at the rate of Rs.5.109 per unit\n\n   for a period of 25 years. Power is available in the\n\n   market at a far cheaper rate. The inevitable result\n\n   of implementing the order of the High court would\n\n   be that the appellant would have to purchase power\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                         15</span>\n\fat a much higher rate and what is more disturbing\n\nand should have troubled the High Court to decline\n\njurisdiction is the aspect that the increased rate\n\nwould have to be passed on to the end consumer. Put\n\nit differently, when the appellant being entitled\n\nto terminate the contract and would be in a position\n\nto purchase power at a cheaper rate and charge the\n\nconsumers at the lower rate, by the court granting\n\nrelief to the first respondent, the appellant is\n\ncompelled to purchase power at the higher rate and\n\nthat too for a long period of 25 years, and what is\n\nmore, compelled to pass on the burden to the hapless\n\nconsumer. Thus, public interest in fact in the case\n\nlay in the court declining to grant relief to the\n\nfirst respondent. He would further point out that\n\nthe impugned judgment does not deal with any of the\n\naspects, be it the factual dimensions or the legal\n\nrequirements. The judgment is bereft of discussion\n\nof the contentions raised by the appellant. He would\n\ntherefore   contend   that   the   impugned   judgments\n\nshould be set aside and appeals allowed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                        16</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">\f11. Per     contra,   Dr.   A.M.   Singhvi,      learned    Senior\n\nCounsel for the first respondent would point out that\n\nthere is absolutely no basis for maintaining the appeal\n\nin the facts. He would point out that this is a case\n\nwhere the first respondent turned out to be the lowest\n\nbidder in respect of the project in question and what\n\nis   more    an   incredible       number   of     182     bidders\n\nparticipated. It is trouncing its       competitors that the\n\nholding company of the first respondent turned out to\n\nbe the lowest bidder (here we must notice that during\n\nthe course of the arguments the appellant did propose\n\nthat first respondent could come up with proposal which\n\napparently should involve rates lower than the contract\n\nrate so that the public interest concern is adequately\n\naddressed whereas the first respondent pointed out\n\nsince it has planned for the project on the basis which\n\nmade it the lowest bidder, it would not be feasible for\n\nit to reduce the rate any further). Dr. Singhvi pointed\n\nout that there is no basis for discriminating the case\n\nof the first respondent and M/s. Renew Energy. It is\n\npointed out that the High Court in the first round of\n\nlitigation had interfered with the termination order\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                              17</span>\n\ffollowing the judgment in Renew Energy. In the case of\n\nRenew    Energy,   it   could   achieve   fulfilment    of    the\n\nconditions subsequent with a delay of 16 days which was\n\ncondoned finally. In the case of the first respondent,\n\nthe delay happened to be 56 days. Otherwise, their\n\ncases    are   similar.   Renew      Energy   was   allowed    to\n\ncommission whereas the first respondent was at the\n\nreceiving end of discrimination without any basis. He\n\nwould point out that the first respondent under the\n\ncontract had 24 months from 18.09.2015 to commission\n\nthe project. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_28\">Well before the expiry of 24 months, the\n\nproject was ready. The respondent was prevented from\n\ncommissioning. A party cannot take advantage of its own\n\nwrong. He would point out that the law has not stood\n\nstill after this Court adopted a hands off approach in\n\nthe decision in <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_10\">Radhakrishna Agrawal and others v.\n\nState of Bihar</a> and others2.       Imbibing the grand mandate\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 14</a> that it behoves the State to steer clear\n\nof unfairness in all its acts, this Court has weaved a\n\ntaboo against arbitrary action by the state even after\n\nit entered into a contract.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_29\">He would point out in this\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">2</span>\n    (1977) 3 SCC 457\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                18</span>\n\fregard the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_12\">ABL International\n\nLtd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corpn. of India Ltd.3</a>\n\nand the decisions following the same approving of the\n\nwrit court granting relief in contractual matters also.\n\nHe would point out that, present arbitrariness, be it\n\nafter a contract is entered into, the State has no\n\nplace to hide when action is challenged and its action\n\nmust pass the scrutiny of the constitutional court. It\n\nmust demonstrate that the action was fair. The action\n\nof the State falls far short of the exacting standard\n\nof fairness that the Constitution demands in the case\n\nat hand for the following reasons:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">12. Outbidding an unusually large body of competitors,\n\na bid based on competitive tariff, the first respondent\n\nwhich is a global player in Renewable Energy (solar\n\npower) bids at a rate which was very much acceptable\n\nto the appellant and investment was made by the first\n\nrespondent in the region of nearly Rs. 350 crores.\n\nThere was an initial hiccup. One of the conditions\n\nsubsequent was that the first respondent had to acquire\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">3</span>\n    (2004) 3 SCC 553\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                          19</span>\n\fland for the project by way of sale deeds. There were\n\ninsuperable obstacles which upon the first respondent\n\npointing them out to the                  appellant, the appellant\n\nrealized      the    genuine       difficulty        and    amended     the\n\nArticle. This, in fact, would necessarily mean that the\n\nperiod of 210 days would commence not from the date of\n\nthe   agreement      but    thereafter         on   the    basis   of   the\n\namended    Article.        The    first    respondent       engaged     the\n\nservices of a company for the purposes of purchase and\n\ninstallation        of   the     parts    of   the   project.      It   had\n\nprocured, inter alia the invertors which were to be\n\ninstalled,      from       abroad.         There     are     irrefutable\n\ndocuments in the form of invoices, bills of lading,\n\nlorry receipts which fortify the first respondent in\n\nits stand that it had installed all the invertors. The\n\nproject was ready to take off well within 24 months.\n\nThe   first    respondent         would    suffer     grave    avoidable\n\nfinancial loss, besides fall in esteem as a global\n\nplayer, if the termination dated 07.07.2018 is allowed\n\nto stand. Under the contract, the first respondent was\n\nobliged to sell power at an agreed rate for a period\n\nof 25 years. The fact that in view of the play of market\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                     20</span>\n\fforces, there has been a fall in the price of solar\n\npower and it would be open to the appellant to procure\n\nsolar power at a cheaper rate should not allow the\n\nappellant to resile from its contractual obligations.\n\nIn fact, it is pointed out that the appellant is\n\npurchasing power even now at even higher rates. Being\n\nState under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 12</a>, the appellant should not be\n\npermitted to seek shelter under the theory of alternate\n\nremedies. This Court is reminded of the chronology of\n\nevents commencing from the date of the PPA in the year\n\n2015. The first respondent has succeeded before the\n\nHigh court on two occasions. In this regard he would\n\npoint out that in the impugned termination order dated\n\n07.07.2018, the appellant has purported to revive the\n\nclosed chapter relating to non-fulfilment of conditions\n\nsubsequent. The contention runs that by the judgment\n\nin the first writ petition the impugned order therein\n\nwhich was based on the first respondent not fulfilling\n\nthe conditions subsequent was quashed. This was done\n\nbeing inspired by the judgment of the High court in the\n\ncase of Renew Energy which has received the seal of\n\napproval by this Court as well. As far as the only\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                          21</span>\n\fother aspect about commissioning not being in time Dr.\n\nSinghvi addressed two submissions. Firstly, he would\n\npoint out that admittedly, the appellant has not issued\n\nthe pre-termination notice contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 9.1</a>\n\nof the PPA.       This suffices to sustain the judgment.\n\nSecondly, equally importantly the appellant has acted\n\narbitrarily in not realizing that the first respondent\n\nhad 24 months to commission the project and before the\n\nexpiry of the same, the respondent was fully ready to\n\nfulfil its obligation. The learned senior counsel would\n\nalso submit that contention of there being disputed\n\nquestions of fact is premised on red herrings. In this\n\nregard he would point out that on 09.07.2017, a notice\n\nwas issued by the first respondent to the appellant\n\ncalling upon the appellant to inspect and it would be\n\nready to commission the project and that it was ready\n\nto supply power. However, no inspection was carried by\n\nthe   appellant    till   19.04.2018.   The   competent   body\n\nnamely the CEIG had carried out inspection which spread\n\nover a few days. The Body was fully satisfied with the\n\nfirst respondent being compliant. All that happened was\n\nafter the inspection, in September, 2017 since the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                              22</span>\n\ffirst respondent was visited with the first order of\n\ntermination dated 11.08.2017 which was challenged in\n\nthe High Court, there was a shortage of personnel\n\naround the project site. This facilitated thefts of the\n\nparts which were installed. FIRs promptly registered\n\nin September 2017 should rule out the possibility of\n\nthe case of theft being an afterthought. This is as the\n\ninspection was carried by the appellant much later on\n\n19.04.2018. It is further pointed out that as far as\n\nthe duplication is concerned in the number of certain\n\ninvertors, it has been established as inconsequential\n\nby the first respondent. The inspection and the report\n\nof the CEIG cannot be lightly brushed aside on such a\n\ncase.   Still furthermore, it is pointed out that having\n\nregard to the massive cost of the project which stood\n\nat   nearly   Rs.   350   crores,   what   is   involved    is   a\n\nminiscule percentage. In this regard learned counsel\n\nwould emphasise the contravention of <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 9.1</a> under\n\nwhich the appellant was obliged to serve a notice in\n\ncase    of    the   alleged   seller’s     default    for    not\n\ncommissioning the project in 24 months from the date\n\nof PPA. If such a notice had been given, the first\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                              23</span>\n\frespondent would have had an opportunity if at all even\n\nproceeding on the basis of appellant’s contention being\n\ntenable to procure invertors which are portable and\n\navailable in the market and redress the problem. When\n\nthe project has progressed in the manner, it had to\n\ndeny the first respondent the fruits of its labour,\n\nacting under a solemn contract awarded to it would be\n\nclearly unfair. The mere fact that there had been a\n\nfall in the market price of solar power should not\n\npersuade   this   Court    to    find       that    there    is   no\n\noverwhelming public interest. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74190276\" id=\"span_38\">In this regard he also\n\nsought to draw support from recent Judgment of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/74190276/\" id=\"a_16\">Vice Chairman &amp; Managing Director, City and\n\nIndustrial Development Corporated of Maharashtra Ltd.\n\nand Another v. Shishir Realty P. Ltd. and others</a>. He\n\nwould   further   point    out       that   solar    power    being\n\nrenewable energy and green energy must be encouraged\n\nand it was on this basis that the first respondent\n\nparticipated in the global tender and was selected,\n\nupon it being the lowest bidder amongst a large number\n\nof   bidders.   Dr.   Singhvi    would      point   out   that    for\n\nvarious reasons the contract in question is a statutory\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                24</span>\n\fcontract. He would submit that any rate irrespective\n\nof being statutory contract or not, it is but a fact\n\nin   deciding   whether    the    writ     applicant   should    be\n\nrelegated to an alternate remedy. The jurisdiction of\n\nthe High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> in the overpowering\n\npresence of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 14</a> would embrace the power to\n\nstrike at arbitrary action by the State, even in the\n\nworking out of rights in a non-statutory contract.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">13. Shri V. Giri, learned senior counsel for respondent\n\nNo.5 would support the appellant in its stand that the\n\nfirst respondent was in clear breach of the contract.\n\nIt is the case of fifth respondent that there are\n\nvarious steps to be undertaken and completed under\n\nregulations extant before which commissioning can be\n\npermitted. It is the case of the fifth respondent that\n\nthe first respondent could not therefore be said to\n\nhave acted in      compliance with the regulations and\n\ntherefore    cannot   be     heard    to    say   that   it     had\n\ncommissioned the project.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">14. Shri    K.M.   Natraj,   Additional      Solicitor   General\n\nwould submit that the judgment of the High court in the\n\nfirst-round litigation left it open to the appellant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                 25</span>\n\fto take fresh proceedings under the contract. It is for\n\nthe   said   reason     that   <a href=\"/doc/74190276/\" id=\"a_19\">the     said    judgment</a>      was   not\n\nchallenged by the appellant. He would also point out\n\nat any rate even proceeding on the basis that the High\n\nCourt is bound by the earlier judgment at any rate, as\n\nfar as this Court is concerned, it would be free to\n\nconsider the issue as to whether on account of there\n\nbeing   an   admitted    delay    of   53     days   by    the   first\n\nrespondent beyond the maximum time contemplated under\n\nthe   contract   for    fulfilling      conditions        subsequent,\n\nwhether the appellant was justified being duty bound\n\nin the matter of terminating the contract? He further\n\npointed out that there was a distinction in the case\n\nof the first respondent and the case of Renew Energy.\n\nIn the case of Renew Energy, this Court while refusing\n\nto interfere with the judgment of the High Court had\n\nmade it clear that it is not pronouncing on the question\n\nas to the delay in fulfilling the conditions subsequent\n\nand its impact. Secondly, it is pointed out that in the\n\ncase of Renew Energy, the said company had gone ahead\n\nand commissioned the project and the only aspect was\n\nthe delay of 16 days whereas in the case of the first\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 26</span>\n\frespondent the contract was liable to be terminated\n\nboth for the reasons that the conditions subsequent was\n\nnot fulfilled within the maximum time and also for the\n\nreason that the first respondent had not commissioned\n\nthe     project     within       the    time   provided       under   the\n\ncontract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">15.

It is one thing to hold that the appellant,\n\nas a fully owned Government Company, would be State for\n\nthe purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nand, quite another, to find that a contract is one\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                   29</span>\n\fwhich is made in the executive power of the State within\n\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 162</a> of the Constitution. What\n\nis contemplated, is the power of the Union or the State\n\nread in conjunction with <a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 73</a> and <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 162</a> of\n\nthe   Constitution    of   India,    respectively.    In   other\n\nwords, for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1174818/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 298</a>, the broader\n\nconcept of State, as defined in <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 12</a> of the\n\nConstitution,     which,   no   doubt,     would   include   the\n\nappellant,   is      inapposite      and   inapplicable.     The\n\nappellant, being a Company, would not be entitled to\n\nexercise the executive power contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_31\">Article\n\n162</a> of the Constitution, which is the power with the\n\nUnion or the State Governments. In this regard we may\n\nnotice that the present avtar of <a href=\"/doc/1174818/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 298</a> is born\n\nby substituting in 1956 the original version and the\n\npresent version reads as follows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      “298.

Moving on to the concept of the Statutory Contract,\n\nthe learned Additional Solicitor General, no doubt,\n\nsought to draw considerable support from the Judgment\n\nof this Court reported in <a href=\"/doc/318728/\" id=\"a_34\">Kerala SEB and another v.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                          31</span>\n\fKurien E. Kalathil</a> and others4. That was a case, which\n\ninvolved, a Writ Petition filed by a contractor, who\n\nwas awarded the work of construction of a dam, staking\n\na     claim,   for   enhanced     minimum        wages,    which   the\n\ncontractor claimed, he had paid to his workers. There\n\nwas no dispute that the workmen were entitled to the\n\nenhanced wages under a Notification. The appellant-\n\nBoard,     however,     contended         that     the     respondent-\n\ncontractor had failed to prove the payment of the\n\nenhanced wages to the workmen. The High Court allowed\n\nthe Writ Petition and this Court, while setting aside\n\nthe     Judgment,     proceeded      to     make     the    following\n\nstatement:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       “10. We find that there is a merit in the first\n       contention of Mr Raval. Learned counsel has\n       rightly questioned the maintainability of the\n       writ   petition.    The   interpretation    and\n       implementation of a clause in a contract cannot\n       be the subject-matter of a writ petition.\n       Whether the contract envisages actual payment\n       or not is a question of construction of\n       contract. If a term of a contract is violated,\n       ordinarily the remedy is not the writ petition\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226.</a> We are also unable to agree\n       with the observations of the High Court that\n       the contractor was seeking enforcement of a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">4</span>\n    (2000) 6 SCC 293\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                32</span>\n\fstatutory contract. A contract would not become\nstatutory simply because it is for construction\nof a public utility and it has been awarded by\na statutory body. We are also unable to agree\nwith the observation of the High Court that\nsince the obligations imposed by the contract\non the contracting parties come within the\npurview of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_36\">Contract Act</a>, that would not\nmake the contract statutory. Clearly, the High\nCourt fell into an error in coming to the\nconclusion that the contract in question was\nstatutory in nature.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">11. A statute may expressly or impliedly confer\npower on a statutory body to enter into\ncontracts in order to enable it to discharge\nits functions. Dispute arising out of the terms\nof such contracts or alleged breaches have to\nbe settled by the ordinary principles of law\nof contract. The fact that one of the parties\nto the agreement is a statutory or public body\nwill not by itself affect the principles to be\napplied. The disputes about the meaning of a\ncovenant in a contract or its enforceability\nhave to be determined according to the usual\nprinciples of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_37\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of a\nstatutory body need not necessarily involve an\nexercise of statutory power. Statutory bodies,\nlike private parties, have power to contract\nor deal with property. Such activities may not\nraise any issue of public law. In the present\ncase, it has not been shown how the contract\nis statutory. The contract between the parties\nis in the realm of private law. It is not a\nstatutory contract. The disputes relating to\ninterpretation of the terms and conditions of\nsuch a contract could not have been agitated\nin a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India. That is a matter for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                     33</span>\n\f       adjudication by a civil court or in arbitration\n       if provided for in the contract. Whether any\n       amount is due and if so, how much and refusal\n       of the appellant to pay it is justified or not,\n       are not the matters which could have been\n       agitated and decided in a writ petition. The\n       contractor should have relegated to other\n       remedies.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1941195\" id=\"span_51\">19.

While\n\nnegotiations were going on between the respondent-\n\nState,     Electricity   Board    and     independent      power\n\nproducers, on the basis of State inviting offers from\n\npotential private investors, for establishing power\n\nprojects, the Central Government amended the earlier\n\nTariff Notification. The Electricity Board decided to\n\nprioritize    the   projects,    which    offered    the   least\n\ntariff.    The   appellant-independent       power     producer\n\nchallenged <a href=\"/doc/1941195/\" id=\"a_40\">the said decision</a> in a Writ Petition.

The\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court took the view that\n\nthe PPAs therein were statutory contracts, entered into\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/434568/\" id=\"a_41\">Sections 43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/434568/\" id=\"a_42\">43(A)</a> of the Electricity Supply\n\nAct, 1948. This Court, while dealing with this aspect\n\nand rejecting the contention that the Electricity Board\n\ncould not unilaterally alter the conditions of the\n\ncontract and invite bids, held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">     “11. It was contended by Mr Cooper, learned\n     Senior Counsel appearing for appellant GBL and\n     also by some counsel appearing for other\n     appellants that the appellant/IPPs had entered\n     into PPAs under <a href=\"/doc/434568/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections 43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/701121/\" id=\"a_44\">43-A</a> of the\n     Electricity Supply Act and as such they are\n     statutory contracts and, therefore, MPEB had\n     no power or authority to alter their terms and\n     conditions. ………………\n\n     ……… Merely because a contract is entered into\n     in exercise of an enabling power conferred by\n     a statute that by itself cannot render the\n     contract a statutory contract. If entering into\n     a contract containing the prescribed terms and\n     conditions is a must under the statute then\n     that contract becomes a statutory contract. If\n     a contract incorporates certain terms and\n     conditions in it which are statutory then the\n     said contract to that extent is statutory. A\n     contract may contain certain other terms and\n     conditions which may not be of a statutory\n     character and which have been incorporated\n     therein as a result of mutual agreement between\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                          35</span>\n\f        the parties. Therefore, the PPAs can be\n        regarded as statutory only to the extent that\n        they      contain    provisions      regarding\n        determination of tariff and other statutory\n        requirements of Section 43-A(2). Opening and\n        maintaining of an escrow account or an escrow\n        agreement are not the statutory requirements\n        and,    therefore,   merely    because    PPAs\n        contemplate maintaining escrow accounts that\n        obligation cannot be regarded as statutory.”\n                                   (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1941195\" id=\"span_55\">20.

What is contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1941195/\" id=\"a_61\">India Thermal Power\n\nLimited</a>   (supra),   is    that   a   contract   containing\n\nprescribed terms and conditions being mandatory under\n\nthe   Statute,   results   in   the   contract   becoming   a\n\nStatutory Contract. If this test is applied, we fail\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                            39</span>\n\fto see how the reference to the bidding guidelines,\n\nunder which the bids were made and finally the PPA is\n\nentered into, can be treated as tantamounting to saying\n\nthat the PPA contains prescribed statutory terms and\n\nconditions as an indispensable part of a Statute. We\n\nare not shown also as to how the PPA can be described\n\nas containing terms and conditions, which are statutory\n\nin nature. The expression ‘terms and conditions’, which\n\nare statutory in nature, must be understood as those\n\nstatutory     terms   and   conditions,   which   provide   for\n\nrights and obligations of the contracting parties. Such\n\nreference is conspicuous by its absence in the PPA. It\n\nis common case that the appellant is incorporated under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_62\">Companies Act</a>.

It may be noted that this rule,\nthough supportable also as an emanation from\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 14</a>, does not rest merely on that\narticle. It has an independent existence apart\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 14.</a> It is a rule of administrative\nlaw which has been judicially evolved as a\ncheck against exercise of arbitrary power by\nthe executive authority. If we turn to the\njudgment of Mr Justice Frankfurter and examine\nit, we find that he has not sought to draw\nsupport for the rule from the equality clause\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                     45</span>\n\fof the United States Constitution, but evolved\nit purely as a rule of administrative law. Even\nin England, the recent trend in administrative\nlaw is in that direction as is evident from\nwhat is stated at pp. 540-41 in Prof Wade&#x27;s\n“Administrative Law”, 4th Edn. There is no\nreason why we should hesitate to adopt this\nrule as a part of our continually expanding\nadministrative law. Today with tremendous\nexpansion of welfare and social service\nfunctions, increasing control of material and\neconomic resources and large scale assumption\nof industrial and commercial activities by the\nState, the power of the executive Government\nto affect the lives of the people is steadily\ngrowing. The attainment of socio-economic\njustice being a conscious end of State policy,\nthere is a vast and inevitable increase in the\nfrequency with which ordinary citizens come\ninto relationship of direct encounter with\nState power-holders. This renders it necessary\nto structure and restrict the power of the\nexecutive Government so as to prevent its\narbitrary application or exercise. Whatever be\nthe concept of the Rule of Law, whether it be\nthe meaning given by Dicey in his “The Law of\nthe Constitution” or the definition given by\nHayek   in   his    “Road   to   Serfdom”   and\n“Constitution of Liberty” or the exposition set\nforth by Harry Jones in his “The Rule of Law\nand the Welfare State”, there is as pointed out\nby Mathew, J., in his article on “The Welfare\nState, Rule of Law and Natural Justice” in\n“Democracy, Equality and Freedom” [ Upendra\nBaxi, Ed. : Eastern Book Co., Lucknow (1978)\np. 28] “substantial agreement in juristic\nthought that the great purpose of the rule of\nlaw notion is the protection of the individual\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                     46</span>\n\f       against arbitrary exercise of power, wherever\n       it is found”. It is indeed unthinkable that in\n       a democracy governed by the rule of law the\n       executive Government or any of its officers\n       should possess arbitrary power over the\n       interests of the individual. Every action of\n       the executive Government must be informed with\n       reason and should be free from arbitrariness.\n       That is the very essence of the rule of law\n       and its bare minimal requirement. And to the\n       application of this principle it makes no\n       difference whether the exercise of the power\n       involves affectation of some right or denial\n       of some privilege.”\n\n\n      This   case   while   it    dealt     with   the   issue    of\n\narbitrariness at the stage of award of largesse by the\n\nState, it paved the way for future development in this\n\nfield of law.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1893286\" id=\"span_85\">30.

There is an obvious difference in the\n       contracts    between   private    parties   and\n       contracts to which the State is a party.\n       Private parties are concerned only with their\n       personal interest whereas the State while\n       exercising its powers and discharging its\n       functions, acts indubitably, as is expected of\n       it, for public good and in public interest. The\n       impact of every State action is also on public\n       interest. This factor alone is sufficient to\n       import at least the minimal requirements of\n       public law obligations and impress with this\n       character the contracts made by the State or\n       its instrumentality. It is a different matter\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">14</span>\n     (1991) 1 SCC 212\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                              52</span>\n\fthat the scope of judicial review in respect\nof disputes falling within the domain of\ncontractual obligations may be more limited and\nin doubtful cases the parties may be relegated\nto adjudication of their rights by resort to\nremedies provided for adjudication of purely\ncontractual disputes. However, to the extent,\nchallenge is made on the ground of violation\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 14</a> by alleging that the impugned act\nis arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact\nthat the dispute also falls within the domain\nof contractual obligations would not relieve\nthe State of its obligation to comply with the\nbasic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 14.</a> To this\nextent, the obligation is of a public character\ninvariably in every case irrespective of there\nbeing any other right or obligation in addition\nthereto. An additional contractual obligation\ncannot divest the claimant of the guarantee\nunder <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 14</a> of non-arbitrariness at the\nhands of the State in any of its actions.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">24. The State cannot be attributed the split\npersonality of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the\ncontractual field so as to impress on it all\nthe characteristics of the State at the\nthreshold while making a contract requiring it\nto fulfil the obligation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution and thereafter permitting it to\ncast off its garb of State to adorn the new\nrobe of a private body during the subsistence\nof the contract enabling it to act arbitrarily\nsubject only to the contractual obligations and\nremedies flowing from it. It is really the\nnature of its personality as State which is\nsignificant and must characterize all its\nactions, in whatever field, and not the nature\nof function, contractual or otherwise, which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                     53</span>\n\fis decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted\nfor examining the validity of its act. The\nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 14</a> being the duty to act\nfairly, justly and reasonably, there is nothing\nwhich   militates   against   the   concept   of\nrequiring the State always to so act, even in\ncontractual   matters.   There    is   a   basic\ndifference between the acts of the State which\nmust invariably be in pubic interest and those\nof a private individual, engaged in similar\nactivities, being primarily for personal gain,\nwhich may or may not promote public interest.\nViewed in this manner, in which we find no\nconceptual difficulty or anachronism, we find\nno reason why the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 14</a>\nshould not extend even in the sphere of\ncontractual matters for regulating the conduct\nof the State activity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">27. Unlike   a   private   party   whose   acts\nuninformed by reason and influenced by personal\npredilections in contractual matters may\nresult in adverse consequences to it alone\nwithout affecting the public interest, any such\nact of the State or a public body even in this\nfield would adversely affect the public\ninterest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">28. Even assuming that it is necessary to\nimport the concept of presence of some public\nelement in a State action to attract <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_115\">Article\n14</a> and permit judicial review, we have no\nhesitation in saying that the ultimate impact\nof all actions of the State or a public body\nbeing undoubtedly on public interest, the\nrequisite public element for this purpose is\npresent also in contractual matters. We,\ntherefore, find it difficult and unrealistic\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                     54</span>\n\f     to exclude the State actions in contractual\n     matters, after the contract has been made, from\n     the purview of judicial review to test its\n     validity on the anvil of Article 14.”\n                                (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">33. As to what constitutes arbitrariness is captured\n\nin paragraph 36 and it reads as follows:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">     “36. The   meaning    and   true   import   of\n     arbitrariness is more easily visualized than\n     precisely stated or defined. The question,\n     whether an impugned act is arbitrary or not,\n     is ultimately to be answered on the facts and\n     in the circumstances of a given case. An\n     obvious test to apply is to see whether there\n     is any discernible principle emerging from the\n     impugned act and if so, does it satisfy the\n     test of reasonableness. Where a mode is\n     prescribed for doing an act and there is no\n     impediment   in  following    that  procedure,\n     performance of the act otherwise and in a\n     manner which does not disclose any discernible\n     principle which is reasonable, may itself\n     attract the vice of arbitrariness. Every State\n     action must be informed by reason and it\n     follows that an act uninformed by reason, is\n     arbitrary. Rule of law contemplates governance\n     by laws and not by humour, whims or caprices\n     of the men to whom the governance is entrusted\n     for the time being. It is trite that ‘be you\n     ever so high, the laws are above you’. This is\n     what men in power must remember, always.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">34.

Any\n      dispute relating to interpretation of the terms\n      and conditions of such a contract cannot be\n      agitated, and could not have been agitated, in\n      a writ petition.

To the same effect is the meaning given to\nthe expression “arbitrary” by Corpus Juris\nSecundum which explains the term in the\nfollowing words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">“Arbitrary.—Based alone upon one&#x27;s will, and not\nupon any course of reasoning and exercise of\njudgment; bound by no law; capricious; exercised\naccording to one&#x27;s own will or caprice and\ntherefore conveying a notion of a tendency to\nabuse possession of power; fixed or done\ncapriciously or at pleasure, without adequate\ndetermining principle, non-rational, or not done\nor acting according to reason or judgment; not\nbased upon actuality but beyond a reasonable\nextent; not founded in the nature of things; not\ngoverned by any fixed rules or standard; also,\nin a somewhat different sense, absolute in\npower, despotic, or tyrannical; harsh and\nunforbearing. When applied to acts, ‘arbitrary’\nhas been held to connote a disregard of evidence\nor of the proper weight thereof; to express an\nidea opposed to administrative, executive,\njudicial, or legislative discretion; and to\nimply at least an element of bad faith, and has\nbeen compared with ‘willful’.”\n\n\n         xxx           xxx          xxx\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">23. Arbitrariness in the making of an order by\nan authority can manifest itself in different\nforms. Non-application of mind by the authority\nmaking the order is only one of them. Every order\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                       67</span>\n\f   passed by a public authority must disclose due\n   and proper application of mind by the person\n   making the order. This may be evident from the\n   order itself or the record contemporaneously\n   maintained.   Application   of   mind  is   best\n   demonstrated by disclosure of mind by the\n   authority making the order. And disclosure is\n   best done by recording the reasons that led the\n   authority to pass the order in question. Absence\n   of reasons either in the order passed by the\n   authority or in the record contemporaneously\n   maintained is clearly suggestive of the order\n   being arbitrary hence legally unsustainable.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">48. We would, therefore, sum up as to when an act is\n\nto be treated as arbitrary. The court must carefully\n\nattend to the facts and the circumstances of the case.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">It should find out whether the impugned decision is\n\nbased on any principle. If not, it may unerringly point\n\nto arbitrariness. If the act betrays caprice or the\n\nmere exhibition of the whim of the authority it would\n\nsufficiently bear the insignia of arbitrariness. In\n\nthis regard supporting an order with a rationale which\n\nin the circumstances is found to be reasonable will go\n\na long way to repel a challenge to state action. No\n\ndoubt the reasons need not in every case be part of the\n\norder as such. If there is absence of good faith and\n\nthe action is actuated with an oblique motive, it could\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                          68</span>\n\fbe characterised as being            arbitrary. A   total non-\n\napplication of mind without due regard to the rights\n\nof the parties and public interest may be a clear\n\nindicator of arbitrary action. A wholly unreasonable\n\ndecision which is little different from a perverse\n\ndecision under the Wednesbury doctrine would qualify\n\nas an arbitrary decision under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 14.</a> Ordinarily\n\nvisiting a party with the consequences of its breach\n\nunder a contract may not be an arbitrary decision.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_149\">49.

The      petitioner     had   entered   into   an\n\nagreement with the respondent, the Government of India.\n\nThe case of the respondent, inter alia, was one denying\n\nthe case of the petitioner that the omission of <a href=\"/doc/1406475/\" id=\"a_156\">Section\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">23</span>\n     (2015)</a> <a href=\"/doc/128327/\" id=\"a_157\">7</a> SCC 728\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                               69</span>\n\f42 was by oversight.

If the contract between private party and\nthe State/instrumentality and/or agency of the\nState is under the realm of a private law and\nthere is no element of public law, the normal\ncourse for the aggrieved party, is to invoke the\nremedies provided under ordinary civil law\nrather than approaching the High Court under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_163\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and\ninvoking its extraordinary jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                       72</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">\f70.9.

However, it has not\nbeen totally obliterated and where the matter\nfalls purely in private field of contract, this\nCourt has maintained the position that writ\npetition is not maintainable. The dichotomy\nbetween public law and private law rights and\nremedies would depend on the factual matrix of\neach case and the distinction between the public\nlaw remedies and private law field, cannot be\ndemarcated with precision. In fact, each case\nhas to be examined, on its facts whether the\ncontractual relations between the parties bear\ninsignia of public element. Once on the facts of\na particular case it is found that nature of the\nactivity or controversy involves public law\nelement, then the matter can be examined by the\nHigh Court in writ petitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 226</a>\nof the Constitution of India to see whether\naction of the State and/or instrumentality or\nagency of the State is fair, just and equitable\nor that relevant factors are taken into\nconsideration and irrelevant factors have not\ngone into the decision-making process or that\nthe decision is not arbitrary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">70.10.

In other\n\nwords, the contention is that the law in this field\n\nhas    witnessed   an   evolution   and,   what    is    more,   a\n\nrevolution of sorts and a transformatory change with a\n\ngrowing realisation of the true ambit of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 14</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India.

The\n\n           State can, indeed, be called upon to honour its\n\n           obligations of making payment, unless it be that\n\n           there is a serious and genuine dispute raised\n\n           relating to the liability of the State to make\n\n           the payment.

The   existence     of     an       alternate    remedy,       is,\n\n    undoubtedly, a matter to be borne in mind in\n\n    declining     relief       in    a    Writ    Petition     in    a\n\n    contractual matter. Again, the question as to\n\n    whether the Writ Petitioner must be told off the\n\n    gates, would depend upon the nature of the claim\n\n    and    relief      sought       by    the    petitioner,        the\n\n    questions, which would have to be decided, and,\n\n    most importantly, whether there are disputed\n\n    questions     of    fact,       resolution       of    which    is\n\n    necessary, as an indispensable prelude to the\n\n    grant of the relief sought. Undoubtedly, while\n\n    there is no prohibition, in the Writ Court even\n\n    deciding        disputed         questions            of   fact,\n\n    particularly        when        the     dispute        surrounds\n\n    demystifying of documents only, the Court may\n\n    relegate the party to the remedy by way of a\n\n    civil suit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_176\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_177\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_178\">viii.

The reach of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 14</a> enables a Writ Court to\n\n           deal with arbitrary State action even after a\n\n           contract is entered into by the State. A wide\n\n           variety of circumstances can generate causes of\n\n           action    for   invoking      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_184\">Article    14.</a>   The   Court’s\n\n           approach in dealing with the same, would be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">27</span>\n     (1996) 6 SCC 22\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                    81</span>\n\f      guided by, undoubtedly, the overwhelming need to\n\n      obviate arbitrary State action, in cases where\n\n      the Writ remedy provides an effective and fair\n\n      means    of   preventing       miscarriage        of    justice\n\n      arising from palpably unreasonable action by the\n\n      State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_182\">xi.   Termination of contract can again arise in a\n\n      wide variety of situations. If for instance, a\n\n      contract is terminated, by a person, who is\n\n      demonstrated, without any need for any argument,\n\n      to be the person, who is completely unauthorised\n\n      to cancel the contract, there may not be any\n\n      necessity to drive the party to the unnecessary\n\n      ordeal   of    a   prolix      and    avoidable        round   of\n\n      litigation. The intervention by the High Court,\n\n      in such a case, where there is no dispute to be\n\n      resolved,     would     also   be     conducive    in    public\n\n      interest, apart from ensuring the Fundamental\n\n      Right of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 14</a> of the\n\n      Constitution       of   India.       When   it   comes    to   a\n\n      challenge to the termination of a contract by\n\n      the State, which is a non-statutory body, which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                               82</span>\n\fis     acting     in        purported    exercise       of     the\n\npowers/rights under such a contract, it would be\n\nover simplifying a complex issue to lay down any\n\ninflexible Rule in favour of the Court turning\n\naway       the    petitioner        to      alternate        Fora.\n\nOrdinarily, the cases of termination of contract\n\nby   the    State,      acting     within    its   contractual\n\ndomain,     may       not   lend   itself    for   appropriate\n\nredress by the Writ Court. This is, undoubtedly,\n\nso if the Court is duty-bound to arrive at\n\nfindings, which involve untying knots, which are\n\npresented        by     disputed    questions      of    facts.\n\nUndoubtedly, in view of <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_186\">ABL Limited</a> (supra), if\n\nresolving the dispute, in a case of repudiation\n\nof a contract, involves only appreciating the\n\ntrue scope of documentary material in the light\n\nof pleadings, the Court may still grant relief\n\nto an applicant. We must enter a caveat. The\n\nCourts are today reeling under the weight of a\n\ndocket explosion, which is truly alarming. If a\n\ncase involves a large body of documents and the\n\nCourt is called upon to enter upon findings of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                             83</span>\n\f    facts and involves merely the construction of\n\n    the document, it may not be an unsound discretion\n\n    to relegate the party to the alternate remedy.</span>\n\n    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_185\">This   is   not   to   deprive   the     Court    of    its\n\n    constitutional     power    as   <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_187\">laid    down     in</a>    <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_188\">ABL</a>\n\n    (supra).

In a case the State is a party to the contract\n\n    and a breach of a contract is alleged against\n\n    the State, a civil action in the appropriate\n\n    Forum is, undoubtedly, maintainable. But this is\n\n    not the end of the matter. Having regard to the\n\n    position of the State and its duty to act fairly\n\n    and to eschew arbitrariness in all its actions,\n\n    resort to the constitutional remedy on the cause\n\n    of action, that the action is arbitrary, is\n\n    permissible (See in this regard <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_189\">Kumari Shrilekha\n\n    Vidyarthi   and   others    v.

However, it must be made clear that\n\n         every case involving breach of contract by the\n\n         State, cannot be dressed up and disguised as a\n\n         case     of    arbitrary      State       action.    While     the\n\n         concept       of    an    arbitrary       action    or   inaction\n\n         cannot be cribbed or confined to any immutable\n\n         mantra, and must be laid bare, with reference to\n\n         the facts of each case, it cannot be a mere\n\n         allegation         of    breach   of   contract      that    would\n\n         suffice. What must be involved in the case must\n\n         be     action/inaction,           which    must     be   palpably\n\n         unreasonable or absolutely irrational and bereft\n\n         of any principle. An action, which is completely\n\n         malafide, can hardly be described as a fair\n\n         action and may, depending on the facts, amount\n\n         to arbitrary action. The question must be posed\n\n         and answered by the Court and all we intend to\n\n         lay down is that there is a discretion available\n\n         to the Court to grant relief in appropriate\n\n         cases.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">28</span>\n     (1991) 1 SCC 212)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                     85</span>\n\f  xiii.

We have already referred to the\n\ndispute resolution clause, namely, Article 13.2.1 and\n\nArticle 13.2.3. They would appear to indicate that the\n\nclauses may not constitute an arbitration clause. As\n\nfar as Article 13.3.1. is concerned, to which resort\n\nis to be made when the dispute remains unresolved under\n\n13.2.3, it deals with disputes arising from a claim for\n\nany matter relating to the tariff. Therefore, we would\n\ntake the view that it may not be a case where the PPA\n\nprovides   for   an    arbitration      clause    capable   of\n\ndetermining   the     lis     in   question.   The   situation\n\ntherefore contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_192\">U.P. Roof</a> (supra) as <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_193\">laid\n\ndown in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_194\">ABL</a> (supra) does not exist.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\n\nTHE IMPACT OF THE JUDGMENT IN THE FIRST\nWRIT PETITION\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">56. Taking up point no. 5., viz., the effect of the\n\njudgment of the High Court in the earlier round, we\n\nmust notice indeed that this is a case which represents\n\nthe second round of the litigation.            In the earlier\n\nround the respondents had successfully invoked the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                               87</span>\n\fjurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 226</a> when it was served with\n\nthe     order    of   termination    of   the   contract    dated\n\n11.08.2017. We have already noticed the fate of the\n\nsaid case. The first battle which commenced in the year\n\n2017 resumed as it were with the present writ petition.\n\nWe are not oblivious to the fact that the appellant\n\ndid not think it fit to challenge the verdict in the\n\nfirst round of litigation.          No doubt, the case of the\n\nappellant is that the appellant was of the view that\n\nthe court has left it free to the appellant to take\n\nsteps    under    the   contract    for   termination      of   the\n\ncontract. It is the case of the appellant in fact, that\n\nthe judgment of the High Court in the earlier round\n\nwould not be an obstacle for the appellant to revisit\n\nand terminate the contract for the reason that the PPA\n\nmade it incumbent on the appellant to terminate the\n\ncontract under <a href=\"/doc/300602/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 2.1(d)</a> if the contractor did not\n\nfulfil the conditions subsequent even after the expiry\n\nof 210 days and a further period of nine months after\n\nthe commencement of PPA.        We must examine whether the\n\nearlier judgment, in fact, in law permits the appellant\n\nto re-open the said issue.          A perusal of the judgment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                               88</span>\n\fdated 20.6.2017 would reveal that the court was dealing\n\nwith the challenge to the order dated 11.08.2017. The\n\norder dated 11.08.2017 would reveal that the appellant\n\nhas found that there is a delay of 54 days in achieving\n\nthe condition subsequent deadline. After considering\n\nthe representation by the respondent, the appellant\n\nfound that there is no merit in the case of force\n\nmajeure and there was no justification for the delay\n\nin achieving conditions subsequent. Thereafter, the\n\nappellant, in terms of Article 2.5.1(d), terminated the\n\nPPA. Still further, a sum of Rs.1180.50 lakhs was found\n\nrecoverable as penalty in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1303907/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 2.5.</a> It is\n\nthis order which was challenged. Thereafter we find\n\nthat the High court went on to notice that in a similar\n\ncase, viz., relating to New Clean Energy Pvt. Ltd., the\n\npetitioner therein admittedly commissioned the project\n\nwithin the time prescribed except that there was a\n\ndelay of 16 days in achieving the first milestone.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">57.   Here we must understand the word ‘first milestone’\n\nas fulfilment of the conditions subsequent. In regard\n\nto fulfilment of said milestone for which there was a\n\ndelay of 16 days in the case of Renew clean Energy,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                           89</span>\n\fthere was a delay of 54 days in the case of the first\n\nrespondent. It is further noticed by the High Court\n\nthat there was an order passed in favour of the Renew\n\nclean energy setting aside the termination of the\n\ncontract in the said petitioner’s case as confirmed by\n\nthis Court. Next the High Court went on to record that\n\nthere is a dispute as to whether the respondent had\n\ncommissioned the power project in the present case. We\n\nnotice that an attempt was made by the appellant to\n\njustify    the     termination       on     the     basis   that       the\n\nrespondent     had   not    commissioned          the   power    project\n\nwithin the time fixed.           The High Court proceeds to\n\nnotice that the aspect of commissioning the project was\n\nnot the basis for terminating the contract.                      Relying\n\non    Mohinder    Singh    Gill29,    the    appellants         were   not\n\npermitted to supplement the reasons for termination.\n\nFinally, the High court has proceeded to find that\n\nsince    the     similar   reason     for    termination         of    the\n\nagreement in the communication dated 11.8.2017 was not\n\nfound justified in the case of Renew Clean Energy, the\n\nimpugned communication dated 11.08.2017 was set aside.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">29</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">     (1978) 1 SCC 405\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                                 90</span>\n\fIt is thereafter that the liberty was given to the\n\nappellants to pass fresh orders in terms of the PPA in\n\naccordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">58. The appellants would persuade us to hold that the\n\nHigh Court intended, by the liberty granted to leave\n\nit open to the appellant to pass orders invoking its\n\npower   under   the   PPA   which      would   not   only   include\n\ntermination     of    the   PPA    based   on    respondent    not\n\ncommissioning the project within the time but also\n\nrevisit the aspect relating to non-fulfilment of the\n\nconditions subsequent. The respondent would join issue\n\nwith the appellant on the score that judgment of the\n\nHigh Court must be understood as meaning that on the\n\nissue relating to non-fulfilment of the conditions\n\nsubsequent the court made its pronouncement on merits\n\nwith reference to the decision in Renew Clean Energy.\n\nAll that was left open was the question related to the\n\ndelay in commissioning the project.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">59. Learned Additional Solicitor General apart from\n\nreiterating his contention would point out that the\n\nearlier judgment should not be treated as res judicata\n\nand the only reason appellant did not challenge the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">                                  91</span>\n\fHigh court judgment, dated 20.06.2018, was the liberty\n\ngranted. He would further submit that at any rate even\n\nproceeding on the basis that the High court could not\n\nrevisit   the   issue   of   the   non-fulfilment   of   the\n\nconditions subsequent, the decision of the High Court\n\nwould not stand in the way of this Court considering\n\nwhether the order which is impugned in this case which\n\nincludes the issue relating to non-fulfilment of the\n\nconditions subsequent is sustainable. This is apart\n\nfrom pointing out that even in the case of Renew Clean\n\nEnergy, this Court in its order refusing to interfere\n\nin the judgment of the High Court has made it clear\n\nthat it was not going into the merits of the said\n\ncontention having regard to observations which had been\n\nmade, namely, that the contractor therein being faced\n\nwith unavoidable circumstances as also the factum of\n\nhuge investment made in the project.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">60. Having noticed the contents of the decision of the\n\nHigh court dated 20.06.2018 and also bearing in mind\n\nthe terms of the notice of termination dated 11.08.2017\n\nwe are of the view that the High Court must be treated\n\nas having interfered with the order based no doubt on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">                             92</span>\n\fthe order of the said court as affirmed by this Court\n\nin the case of Renew Clean Energy.               Noticing, however,\n\nthe contentions based on the aspect relating to project\n\nnot being commissioned by the respondent within time\n\nand further clearly finding that the impugned order was\n\nnot premised on project not being commissioned the\n\nimpugned   order      was   set     aside    finding        that   the\n\ntermination     was   not   justified       as    regards    to    non-\n\nfulfilment of conditions subsequent. It is thereafter\n\nthat the liberty was granted and it had to pass fresh\n\norder in terms of the PPA.             We have to take the order\n\nas it is and we are of the firm view that the analysis\n\nof the order leads us to only one conclusion which is\n\nthat the High Court intended to only leave open the\n\nright of the appellant to invoke its power under the\n\ncontract   in     regard     to     the     issue     relating      to\n\ncommissioning of the project or rather in the matter\n\nof default in commissioning the project. It would\n\nneither be legal nor equitable to permit the appellant\n\nto   contend   that   the   issue       relating    to   not   having\n\nfulfilled the conditions subsequent can be canvassed\n\nall over again.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">                                  93</span>\n\fAN ASIDE?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">THE STATE LOAD DISPATCH CENTRE (RESPONDENT\nNO.5): ITS STAND AND THE IMPACT OF THE SAME\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">61.

As far as\n\nthe requirement of connection agreement, it has been\n\nstated in the reply affidavit of the first respondent\n\nthat such connection agreement was, indeed, executed\n\nbetween      Respondent      No.1    and   Respondent         No.4.   The\n\nagreement is dated 18.05.2017. At this juncture, we may\n\nnotice    that      a     Sur-Rejoinder        has     been   filed   by\n\nRespondent     No.5.       Having    regard     to     the    connection\n\nagreement, all that is stated is, till date, Respondent\n\nNo.5   was    not       provided    with   a    copy    by    the   first\n\nrespondent. It is also stated that Respondent Nos. 4\n\nand 5 are two distinct entities and, therefore, it was\n\nrequired for compliance that the same should have been\n\nsubmitted to Respondent No. 5. We have already noticed\n\nthat letter dated 23.07.2017 is on the same letterhead,\n\nshowing the names of Respondent Nos. 4 and 5 and signed\n\nby the Superintending Engineer, wherein also, the names\n\nof Respondent Nos. 4 and 5 appear. It is a little\n\nintriguing and strange, that the fifth respondent did\n\nnot know about the agreement and referred to it as a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                    98</span>\n\frequirement and as though it had not been complied with\n\nby the first respondent. The first respondent has\n\nstated that, with regard to the single-line diagram\n\nindicating connectivity with the grid, that it was\n\ncompleted on 19.10.2016. An extension was sought for\n\nby Respondent No.1, in which required diagrams were\n\nfurnished to Respondent No. 4. Respondent No.4, it is\n\nstated,   has    granted     permission    for    charging        the\n\ntransmission line connected from the project to the\n\nSTU.

The    answer   of   Respondent    No.5       in   the   Sur-\n\nRejoinder that the letter dated 29.08.2017 was not\n\nissued by Respondent No.5 but by Respondent No.4. It\n\nis admitted that it is stated therein that the line is\n\nready for charging but further necessary action, like\n\nissuing   of    charging     code,   has   to    be    taken     from\n\nRespondent No.5 by Respondent No.1. It is again stated\n\nthat Respondent No.1 has never approached Respondent\n\nNo.5 with copy of letter dated 29.08.2017 and CEIG\n\napproval for readiness of evacuating line. It is again\n\nstated that Respondent No.5 is not an arm or even unit\n\nof Respondent No.4.

We find\n\nthat as per <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 9.8</a> of the PPA, the first respondent\n\nwas obliged to sell the contracted capacity for a\n\nperiod    of   twenty-five    years        from    COD.

As regards another requirement, viz., approval of\n\nthe CEIG for construction, operation and maintenance\n\nof the electrical plants and electrical lines, it is\n\nthe case of the first respondent that such approval was\n\nobtained by letter dated 10.08.2017. It was also marked\n\nto Respondent No.4. CEIG approval for the electrical\n\nplant was received on 09.08.2017. Respondent No.4, it\n\nis pointed out, had also, on 24.08.2017, issued a Joint\n\nInspection Report certifying that the project may be\n\ncharged. In fact, we find, in the Joint Inspection\n\nReport issued by the fourth respondent that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">        “Newly constructed 132KV D.C.D.S. line from\n        400KV PS Chhegaon to 50MW Pooling Station\n        of M/S Sky Power Solar India Pvt.

In regard to the same, Respondent No.5 in the Sur-\n\nRejoinder    would      state     that     it    is     misleading       and\n\nincorrect on the basis that it has been averred by\n\nRespondent No.1 that the approval of the CEIG for\n\nreadiness of 132KV double circuit line for connection\n\nwith the grid was submitted by the sister concern of\n\nRespondent No.1, while requesting code for charging the\n\n132KV line for the sister concern. It is stated that\n\nin the approval issued on 10.08.2017, there is no\n\nmention   that    the    second     line    will        be    utilised    by\n\nRespondent    No.1.      The      letter        of     the    CEIG    dated\n\n10.08.2017   is   said       to   be    addressed        to    the    sister\n\nconcern. There was to be a specific approval of CEIG\n\nin favour of Respondent No.1. Copy was not marked to\n\nRespondent No.5 but only marked to Respondent No.4. It\n\nagain reiterated that they are two different entities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">67. It    appears       to   us    that     though           letter    dated\n\n10.08.2017   is     addressed      to     the        sister    concern   of\n\nRespondent No.1, viz., Sky Power Solar India Pvt. Ltd.,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                  102</span>\n\fwhat was the subject matter of the communication was\n\nfor 100MW solar power project, and what is more, and\n\nit was for the establishment of 132KV ‘dual’ circuit\n\ntransmission. This understanding of this CEIG Report\n\nis clear from the Joint Inspection Report of Respondent\n\nNo.4 as Respondent No.1 has entered into a PPA for\n\n50MW, and the sister concern, apparently, had a PPA for\n\n50MW. Lastly, even given an opportunity, this is a\n\nmatter which could have been clarified by the CEIG, for\n\nwhich no opportunity appears to have been given. We\n\nbear in mind <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 9.1</a> of the PPA. From the Joint\n\nInspection Report, bearing in mind that 132KV line had\n\na dual circuit, the same line was to be used by the\n\nfirst respondent and its sister concern. This appears\n\nto be the only possible meaning on a joint reading of\n\nthe CEIG Report dated 10.08.2017 and Joint Inspection\n\nReport dated 24.08.2017. We stand fortified in this\n\nregard by the report dated 21.04.2018 also where it is\n\ninter alia stated as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">        “1.

The   next   requirement,      according   to   the   fifth\n\nrespondent was that approval of the PTCC was required.\n\nThe first respondent has, in the reply, stated the said\n\nrequirement was completed on 05.09.2017. We find that\n\nChief Engineer (Procurement) of the fourth respondent\n\nhas recorded in the communication dated 05.09.2017 that\n\nPTCC had accorded PTCC route approval:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">          “With reference to the subject cited above,\n          DET (PTCC), Mumbai has accorded PTCC route\n          approval for charging 132KV DCDS line from\n          400kV S/s Chhegaon to 100MW Solar Power\n          Project of M/s SkyPower Solar India &amp; M/s\n          SkyPower Southeast Solar India Pvt.

The fifth respondent, in the Sur-Rejoinder, in\n\nresponse to the same, would respond by stating that the\n\nRespondent No.4 granting approval, did not mean that\n\nthe same was issued with the knowledge or concurrence\n\nof Respondent No.5. We only remind ourselves that in\n\nthe   Counter    Affidavit   filed    by   Respondent     No.5,\n\nRespondent No.5 had only stated against Requirement\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                             104</span>\n\fNo.VIII that there was the requirement of approval of\n\nPTCC. What is reflected in letter dated 05.09.2017 is\n\nthat DET [PTCC] has accorded PTCC route approval. The\n\napproval is not granted by the fourth respondent. We\n\nare a little mystified by the statement that the PTCC\n\napproval should be one issued with the knowledge and\n\nconcurrence of the fifth respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">70. It   is,   no    doubt,     true    that   as   regards      the\n\ncontention of the fifth respondent that there must be\n\ninterface metering and communication of the meter data\n\nthrough automatic meter reading (AMR), which details\n\nare to be provided to the SLDC before the commissioning\n\nof the plant, there is no specific averment by the\n\nfirst respondent. Here we must notice that it is for\n\nthe first time such a plea is being raised by the fifth\n\nrespondent. Even proceeding on the basis that it was a\n\nrequirement; it is required to be provided before\n\ncommissioning. This is not a matter, which could not\n\nbe set right at any rate, if an opportunity to remove\n\na   defect   was    provided,    as    we   shall   see,   may    be\n\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_204\">Article 9.1.</a> It is also true that\n\nas far as the data and speech communication facility,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                105</span>\n\fthe first respondent has claimed that it was completed\n\non 23.03.2017. We have already referred to it also. The\n\nstand of the fifth respondent is that there is approval\n\nbut it is only in principle. It is complained that till\n\ndate, the telemetry and voice communication was not\n\nworking, in spite of the fact that by letter dated\n\n03.04.2017, relevant IP address for real time data\n\ncommunication was furnished. It is not functional till\n\ndate, in the case of the first respondent, whereas, in\n\nregard to its sister concern, it is operational. A\n\nletter dated 14.10.2021 is produced to indicate that\n\nthe   telemetry   of   the   first   respondent   was   not\n\nintegrated and no real time data was received from the\n\nIP address provided to it. Even, in regard to this\n\nmatter, if an opportunity was to be given in law, to\n\nthe first respondent under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 9.1</a>, it is not\n\nsomething which may be not achievable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">71. We are also dealing with these aspects on the basis\n\nof an affidavit filed raising such issues for the first\n\ntime by the fifth respondent. The fifth respondent had\n\nall the opportunity in the writ petition to raise such\n\ncontentions. Even in the Review Petition, there is only\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">                             106</span>\n\fadoption of the contentions of the appellant.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">72. Emphasis is placed on the statement of Respondent\n\nno.5 by respondent no.1 wherein it is stated “whereas\n\nthough the generating station is ready for generation\n\nof power but the power cannot be evacuated into the\n\ngrid in the absence of transmission line”.                    This is\n\ntaken as an admission of the readiness of the first\n\nrespondent for generation of power. It is pointed out\n\nfurther    that    necessary    approval       was    taken    before\n\nDecember    2016    to    August   2017    for       operating     the\n\ntransmission line.       Respondent No.1 was not allowed to\n\ncommission.    Reliance is also placed on the inspection\n\nreport of the appellant to show that the transmission\n\nline was ready.     The examples about other operators are\n\nbrushed aside as irrelevant.            It is the generator’s\n\nprerogative to sell power in the open market.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_120\">73. A     Sur-Rejoinder    is   filed     by   respondent        No.5.\n\nTherein, it has interestingly produced its return in\n\nthe review petition filed by the appellant before the\n\nHigh court.    Therein we may notice that it referred to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/151736414/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 32(2)</a> of the Electricity Act and its functions.\n\nThereafter it has stated as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">                                107</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">\f       “3.

On receipt of commissioning\n       certificate of a generator, connectivity\n       with the Grid, metering arrangement and\n       other    regulatory   compliances,   SLDC\n       accords permission of injection of power\n       into the Grid. Further, SLDC schedules\n       power of generator to the beneficiary/\n       consumer if the valid Power Purchase\n       Agreement    exists between    buyer  and\n       seller.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">       4.

That, the answering respondent is more\n       of a formal respondent as the agreement\n       was entered into between MPPMCL and the\n       Original Petitioner in Writ Proceedings\n       which is M/s. Sky Power.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_125\">74. No doubt, it has also stated in paragraph-7 that\n\nit adopts all the facts and grounds raised by the review\n\npetitioner, namely, the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">75. It will be noticed that though respondent no.5 was\n\na party to the earlier writ petition as much as it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                          108</span>\n\fa party in the present writ petition, respondent no.5\n\nhas not filed any counter affidavit in either of the\n\nwrit petitions.     It is only in the review petition that\n\nthe respondent no.5 has filed a reply and we have\n\nnoticed its stand.        The stand appears to be that it is\n\nmore of a formal respondent.             Its role comes in only\n\nafter commissioning.        It is in this Court that there\n\nhas been blossoming of its case for the first time. It\n\nis also admitted by respondent No.5 that it is not\n\nconcerned   with    the    pre-commissioning.          It   is   its\n\nspecific    stand   that     all   the    activities    prior    to\n\nreadiness of the generator to inject power are beyond\n\nits purview.   It has specifically stated that its role\n\ncomes only after commissioning the project.                  First\n\nrespondent states that it has not commissioned the\n\nproject.     Its only case is that it was ready to\n\ncommission the project within 24 months as provided in\n\nthe PPA but it was illegally prevented from doing it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">76.   We may only observe that the fifth respondent has,\n\nin the Sur-Rejoinder, owned up letter dated 23.03.2017\n\nas the letter it has sent. The said letter is in the\n\nletterhead of the fourth respondent and therein the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                               109</span>\n\fname of the fifth respondent is also shown. It would\n\nappear that the fifth respondent is created under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/106875435/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 31</a> of the Electricity Act, 2003. <a href=\"/doc/106875435/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 31</a>\n\nreads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">            “Constitution   of  State   Load   Despatch\n            Centres.—(1) The State Government shall\n            establish a Centre to be known as the State\n            Load Despatch Centre for the purpose of\n            exercising the powers and discharging the\n            functions under this Part.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">            (2) The State Load Despatch Centre shall be\n            operated by a Government company or any\n            authority or corporation established or\n            constituted by or under any State Act, as\n            may be notified by the State Government:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                Provided   that   until   a   Government\n            company or any authority or corporation is\n            notified by the State Government, the State\n            Transmission Utility shall operate the State\n            Load Despatch Centre:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">                Provided further that no State Load\n            Despatch Centre shall engage in the business\n            of trading in electricity.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">77. Therefore, it would appear to us that actually the\n\nfifth      respondent    is   to    be   operated    by   the   State\n\nTransmission Utility, which is defined in <a href=\"/doc/150314953/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 2(67)</a>\n\nas the Board (defined as the State Electricity Board)\n\nor   the    Government    company        specified   by   the   State\n\nGovernment under <a href=\"/doc/175830571/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 39(1)</a>, unless it is operated\n\nby a Government company or any authority or corporation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                   110</span>\n\festablished or constituted by or under and State Act.\n\nIt would, therefore, appear to us that if the fourth\n\nrespondent is the State Transmission Utility, it would\n\nbe   the    Body    to    operate    the   fifth   respondent.      The\n\nattempted disassociating of the fifth respondent from\n\nthe fourth respondent, appears to us to be without\n\njustification. However, we leave the matter there. We\n\nmay conclude nearly that all the requirements were met.\n\nThere remained the metering requests and the aspects\n\nabout      furnishing      data.    They   clearly   appear    to    be\n\nmatters which could have been remedied at any rate if\n\na default notice was given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">\nTHE NARRATIVE RESUMES\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">78. At       this    juncture,        we    must     make     certain\n\nobservations.            While the law has evolved from the\n\nhands-off approach to one of contracts lending ground\n\nfor writ courts making a foray into decisions by State\n\nand its instrumentalities even in contractual matter,\n\nthere are certain principles which we have already in\n\nfact generally noticed.            We have already found that the\n\ncontract in question, i.e., the PPA, is not a statutory\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                    111</span>\n\fcontract.    We have also noticed that even if it is a\n\nnon-statutory contract, there is no absolute bar in\n\ndealing with a cause of action based on acts or omission\n\nby the State or its instrumentalities even during the\n\ncourse of the working of a contract. We again reiterate\n\nthat a monetary claim arising from a contract may be\n\nsuccessfully urged by a writ applicant but the premise\n\nwould not be a mere breach of contract.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_220\">Being part of\n\npublic law the case must proceed on the basis of there\n\nbeing arbitrariness vitiating the decision. The matter\n\nshould not fall within a genuinely disputed question\n\nof facts scenario.      The dispute which must be capable\n\nof   being   resolved   on   a   proper   understanding     of\n\ndocuments which are not in dispute may furnish a cause\n\nof action in a writ court.         Such was the case in <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_212\">ABL</a>\n\n(supra).     What is this litigation all about?           This\n\nlitigation is not about enforcing a monetary claim.\n\nThe writ petition lays a challenge to the termination\n\nof the contract.     A termination of the contract, no\n\ndoubt, again may not be immune if it is found to be\n\nafflicted with the vice of arbitrariness. Interference\n\nagain may be refused if the court finds that the case\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                             112</span>\n\freally belongs to the small area with unclear contours\n\nwhere it can be appropriated as a private law dispute.\n\nThe distinction between public law and private law has\n\nconcededly been reduced to nearly imperceptible terms\n\nbut the distinction in law remains.</span>               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_222\">As far as the\n\npublic law aspect is concerned, we are inclined to take\n\nthe view that in view of what has been <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_213\">laid down in</a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_214\">Shri Vidhyarthi Lekha</a> (supra), the impact of the action\n\nin   a   contractual       matter    in   the   facts   by   public\n\nauthority is felt in public domain.               We are dealing\n\nwith the action of the appellant in terminating the\n\ncontract dealing with the right to generate renewable\n\nenergy and for supplying it to the consumers. Supply\n\nof   power     and   its   consumption     are    imperative    and\n\nindispensable needs for not only the common man but\n\nalso     for   the   efficient      functioning    of   trade   and\n\nindustry. Decisions in this domain do impinge on public\n\ninterest. Therefore, we would not be inclined to shut\n\nthe doors on the first respondent in this matter. We\n\nalso bear in mind that this is the second round of\n\nlitigation.

The High Court erred in not\n\nbearing in mind this fundamental principle the argument\n\nruns.

The   quantum       of   the\n\nproject of the first respondent is only 50 megawatts,\n\nwhich constitutes 0.33 per cent of the total demand.\n\nPurchasing such a small capacity, in terms of the rate\n\nunder the PPA, would make no difference to the consumer\n\ntariff. This is apart from countenancing the appellant\n\nreneging on a binding contract, which involves reaching\n\na   reward     for   arbitrary    State     action,        besides,\n\ndestroying an investment of Rs.331 crores. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"74190276\" id=\"span_228\">In this\n\nregard, reliance is placed on the Judgment of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/74190276/\" id=\"a_217\">Vice Chairman &amp; Managing Director, City and\n\nIndustrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Ltd.\n\nand another v.

The   question   about    public\n\ninterest arose in the context of the provision in the\n\ncontract, which provided for waiver, which would be a\n\nunilateral act under <a href=\"/doc/161074276/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 18.3</a> of the PPA therein.\n\nThe Court also discussed the effect of <a href=\"/doc/1105874/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 63</a> of\n\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872. The Court, while dealing\n\nwith waiver and public interest, held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">             “21.

But\n           it is important to note that waiver is an\n           intentional relinquishment of a known right,\n           and that, therefore, unless there is a clear\n           intention to relinquish a right that is\n           fully known to a party, a party cannot be\n           said to waive it. But the matter does not\n           end here. It is also clear that if any\n           element of public interest is involved and\n           a waiver takes place by one of the parties\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">31</span>\n     (2021) SCC Online SC 1141\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                                   117</span>\n\f           to an agreement, such waiver will not be\n           given effect to if it is contrary to such\n           public interest.

(2) The goods or services\n        which are being commissioned could be for a\n        public purpose, such as, construction of roads,\n        public buildings, power plants or other public\n        utilities. (3) The public would be directly\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">34</span>\n     (1999) 1 SCC 492\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">                              120</span>\n\f     interested in the timely fulfilment of the\n     contract so that the services become available\n     to the public expeditiously. (4) The public\n     would also be interested in the quality of the\n     work undertaken or goods supplied by the\n     tenderer. Poor quality of work or goods can\n     lead   to   tremendous public hardship and\n     substantial    financial   outlay  either   in\n     correcting mistakes or in rectifying defects\n     or even at times in redoing the entire work —\n     thus involving larger outlays of public money\n     and delaying the availability of services,\n     facilities or goods, e.g., a delay in\n     commissioning a power project, as in the\n     present case, could lead to power shortages,\n     retardation     of   industrial   development,\n     hardship to the general public and substantial\n     cost escalation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">     11. When a writ petition is filed in the High\n     Court challenging the award of a contract by a\n     public authority or the State, the court must\n     be satisfied that there is some element of\n     public interest involved in entertaining such\n     a petition. If, for example, the dispute is\n     purely between two tenderers, the court must\n     be very careful to see if there is any element\n     of public interest involved in the litigation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">     A mere difference in the prices offered by the\n     two tenderers may or may not be decisive in\n     deciding whether any public interest is\n     involved in intervening in such a commercial\n     transaction.

Therefore, on a conspectus of the case law, we find\n\nthat the concept of overwhelming public interest has\n\nessentially evolved in the context of cases relating to\n\nthe award of contract by the State. It becomes an\n\nimportant consideration in the question as to whether\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">                         121</span>\n\fthen the State with whatever free play it has in its\n\njoints decides to award a contract, to hold up the\n\nmatter     or    to    interfere      with    the      same       should   be\n\naccompanied by a careful consideration of the harm to\n\npublic     interest.        We   do   not    go     on      to    say     that\n\nconsideration of public interest should not at all\n\nenter the mind of the court when it deals with a case\n\ninvolving repudiation of a claim under a contract or\n\nfor that matter in the termination of the contract.\n\nHowever,    there      is   a    qualitative      difference         in    the\n\nlatter categories of cases. Once the State enters into\n\nthe contract, rights are created. If the case is brought\n\nto   the   constitutional         court     and   it     is      invited   to\n\ninterfere with State action on the score that its action\n\nis palpably arbitrary, if the action is so found then\n\nan appeal to public interest must be viewed depending\n\non the facts of each case. If the aspect of public\n\ninterest flows entirely on the basis that the rates\n\nembodied        in    the    contract       which      is        arbitrarily\n\nterminated has with the passage of time become less\n\nappealing to the State or that because of the free play\n\nof market forces or other developments, there is a fall\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">                                   122</span>\n\fin the rate of price of the services or goods then this\n\ncannot    become      determinative        of    the       question      as    to\n\nwhether court         should decline jurisdiction. In this\n\ncase, it is noteworthy that the rates were in fact\n\nsettled     on   the    basis      of    international           competitive\n\nbidding and in which as many as 182 bidders participated\n\nand   the   rate      offered     by     the    first      respondent         was\n\nundoubtedly the lowest. The fact that power has become\n\ncheaper in the market subsequently by itself should not\n\nresult in non-suiting of the complaint of the first\n\nrespondent,      if     it   is    found       that    a   case    of    clear\n\narbitrariness         has    been       established         by    the        first\n\nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">89.

Thereafter, the finding is that the project\n\nwas certified to be completed much prior to 24 months\n\nwhich period ended on 19.9.2017 and the notice of\n\ncommissioning was given on 4.7.2017. The CEIG approval\n\nwas also granted on 9.8.2017. It is further found that\n\nanother inspection was done on 19.04.2018 after nine\n\nmonths of the notice of commissioning and the CEIG\n\napproval. It is despite the same that the impugned\n\norder has been passed. Still further the High court\n\nproceeds to find that it is undisputedly established\n\nthat both the milestones of the project were completed\n\nwhereas only some of the invertors were stolen for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_261\">                            136</span>\n\fwhich an FIR was also lodged. It is again found that\n\nit is not in dispute that the aforesaid parts have been\n\nreplaced by the respondent. Support was drawn from the\n\ncase of Renew Energy and the courts discretion to\n\ninterfere in the matter was reiterated. The decision\n\nwas found to be arbitrary. The court directed the\n\nrespondent to file necessary application for statutory\n\nsanction for operation of the unit and the appellant\n\nwas to decide on the application. To complete the\n\nnarrative     a    review    petition,   was    filed      by   the\n\nappellant. The appellant sought to project the aspect\n\nof   fraud.   The    fraud   consisted   of    the   act   of   the\n\nrespondent        relying    on    unique/distinctive       serial\n\nnumbers of the invertors in regard to a number of\n\ninvertors which were found to be common/duplicate.               In\n\nother words, the case of the appellant was that the\n\nproject for 50 MV was divided into 10 blocks of 5\n\nmegawatt. Each block had 116/117 invertors. A fraud was\n\ncommitted on the CEIG. In other words, it was the\n\nappellants case that the respondent had not complied\n\nwith the PPA in regard to the installing of the required\n\nnumber of invertors. The first respondent took the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_262\">                                  137</span>\n\fstand that the all the serial number of the invertors\n\nwere quite legible though the contrary was contended.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">The CEIG reported the physical readiness of the project\n\nfor commissioning. The respondent also drew upon the\n\ninspection report of the appellant itself. The High\n\nCourt     bearing       in   mind    the     limited     jurisdiction\n\ndismissed the review.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">103. In     the        impugned     Termination         Notice   dated\n\n07.07.2018, after referring to the delay of 54 days in\n\nfulfilling condition subsequent, it is mentioned that\n\nthe       commercial          operation          date,      as        per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817828/\" id=\"a_258\">Article 2.6</a>, was 14.04.2017. It was indicated that\n\nthere was no indication regarding commissioning against\n\nthe column ‘readiness of plant’ as on 11.08.2017. The\n\nlast date for commencement of supply was shown as\n\n18.09.2017. The expiry date of three months period for\n\ncommencement of supply from the last due date was\n\n18.12.2017. It is further provided that the expiry date\n\nof seven days of PPA Termination Notice period was\n\n25.12.2017. The status of the project as on 19.04.2018\n\nwas     indicated       as   ‘not    ready      for   commissioning’.\n\nThereafter,       it    is   pointed      out    that    there   is    no\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">                                    138</span>\n\fjustification     for   delay     in        achieving        condition\n\nsubsequent. Still further, reference is made to the\n\nOrder passed by the High Court in the earlier Writ\n\nPetition. Physical verification was carried out on\n\n19.04.2018, whereupon, it was found that installation\n\nwork of plant and equipment was incomplete in Blocks 9\n\nand 10. It was further pointed out that the copy of\n\nthe Inspection Report was enclosed, where installation\n\nof   invertors,    installation        of    solar      EV    panels,\n\ncabelling and earthing work, was yet to be completed.\n\nIt was further pointed out that even after more than\n\nsix months, after deadline of commissioning of project,\n\nthe plant is not ready for commissioning. Thus, there\n\nwas not only failure to achieve condition subsequent\n\nbut also failure to commission the project within time.\n\nIn comparison with the case of Renew Clean Energy, it\n\nis pointed out that apart from failure to comply with\n\ncondition subsequent, even the outer timeline has not\n\nbeen observed, whereas, in the case of Renew Clean\n\nEnergy, they were ready to commission by the scheduled\n\ncommissioning date. The timeline under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 9.1</a> was\n\nnot conformed to. After referring to the Order of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">                           139</span>\n\fHigh    Court,      it    was   found      that,    with    reference     to\n\nArticle 2.5.1(d) and <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_260\">Article 9.1</a> of the PPA, the PPA\n\nwas terminated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">104. Let us demystify the case for termination. Apart\n\nfrom    non-fulfilment            of     the   condition         subsequent,\n\napparently, in tune with the liberty granted by the\n\nHigh Court, the appellant has set out a case that the\n\nlast date of commencement of supply was 18.09.2017, and\n\neven as on 19.04.2018, the respondent was not ready for\n\ncommissioning        of     the        project.    With     reference     to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_261\">Articles 5.1</a><a href=\"/doc/1188180/\" id=\"a_262\">, 5.2</a> and <a href=\"/doc/507956/\" id=\"a_263\">5.3</a> of the PPA, which consisted\n\nof     the    commercial        operation         date,    pre-commercial\n\noperation and notice of commercial operation, it is\n\nstated that the respondent has not intimated regarding\n\nthe schedule of commissioning, till the date of the\n\nTermination Notice. A distinction is sought to be drawn\n\nbetween Renew Clean Energy and the respondent, in that\n\nthe    case    of   the    first        respondent,       even    the   first\n\nrespondent was not ready to commission the project\n\nwithin the stipulated time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_169\">105. The case that the first respondent has projected\n\nin the Writ Petition, on the other hand, is, inter\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_265\">                                       140</span>\n\falia, as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">          On   04.07.2017,      while        issuing      letter    to\n\n    respondent       no.4,      it         issued      notice      for\n\n    commissioning by 31.07.2017, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1001719/\" id=\"a_264\">Article\n\n    5.1(c)</a> of the PPA. Site inspection by the appellant\n\n    was   solicited     through      its    EPC.    The   respondent\n\n    obtained approval from the CEIG for commissioning\n\n    on    09.08.2017.    The      CEIG      certified      that    all\n\n    infrastructure and installation pertaining to the\n\n    project were ready and the respondent may proceed\n\n    with the commissioning activities. CEIG approval\n\n    is requirement under <a href=\"/doc/507956/\" id=\"a_265\">Article 5.3(a).</a> However, the\n\n    appellant proceeded to terminate the PPA by Order\n\n    dated 07.07.2018. Thus, it is stated that the\n\n    appellant, for reasons best known to it, chose to\n\n    ignore     the    first     respondent’s           request     for\n\n    proceeding with the commissioning of the project.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">    The    respondent     also       obtained        in    principle\n\n    connectivity for the project from the appellant.\n\n    It is the specific case of the respondent that\n\n    prior to 11.08.2017, first respondent had received\n\n    intimation from its EPC Contractor that the project\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_266\">                               141</span>\n\fwas ready for commissioning barring minor works\n\npending   completion      such     as    construction     of\n\nshed/cubical for the Guard which would have no\n\nbearing   on     the     project      commissioning.      The\n\nrespondent     pointed   out   that     the   appellant   was\n\nobliged to issue default notice under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_266\">Article 9.1</a>\n\nof the PPA. The respondent was entitled for a\n\nperiod of three months. No such notice was issued.\n\nAs far as the Report of the Inquiry Committee dated\n\n19.04.2018, relied on by the appellant, it is\n\npointed out that the challenge to the earlier\n\ntermination notice was pending and the respondent\n\nwas constrained to demobilise its staff/security\n\nguards. Thefts took place.         It is pointed out that\n\nthese thefts took place after the certification by\n\nthe CEIG. In other words, the respondent would\n\nblame the appellant for not conducting an inquiry\n\nimmediately after the certification by the CEIG.\n\nIt is also the case of the first respondent that,\n\nthrough its EPC Contractor, it had procured, inter\n\nalia, 1163 string invertors. Some of the string\n\ninvertors were stolen, as stated earlier. That the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_267\">                         142</span>\n\f    case of the respondent is not that the project had\n\n    been commissioned but that the appellant prevented\n\n    it from commissioning the project before the last\n\n    date. It is also seen stated that the project was\n\n    complete in all respects from the side of the\n\n    respondent but on account of theft of a very small\n\n    number of equipment, highlighted by the appellant\n\n    in its Inspection Report, the first respondent had,\n\n    in the meanwhile ensured to get these miscellaneous\n\n    equipments and parts reinstalled and the project\n\n    was complete in all respects as on that date. As\n\n    far as the theft is concerned, the first respondent\n\n    had lodged two FIRs through its EPC Contractor well\n\n    before the inspection carried out on 19.04.2018.\n\n\nTHE ASPECT OF DISPUTED QUESTIONS OF FACTS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">106. What are the disputed questions of facts? The most\n\nimportant disputed question of fact is as to whether\n\nthe first respondent was, in fact, ready to commission\n\nthe project by the end of the peremptory date, which\n\nwas fixed as a period of twenty-four months from the\n\ndate of the agreement. On the one hand, the appellant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_268\">                         143</span>\n\fwould contend that first respondent was not ready to\n\ncommission the project. This is for the reason that in\n\nthe 9th and the 10th Blocks, certain string invertors\n\nwere found missing. On the other hand, the case of the\n\nrespondent is based on the Report of the CEIG, which\n\nwould show that the respondent was ready to commission\n\nthe project. As far as the CEIG Report is concerned,\n\nthe case of the appellant appears to be that the\n\nrespondent had played a fraud in obtaining the CEIG\n\nReport. This was unsuccessfully canvassed before the\n\nHigh Court in the Review Petition. In other words, the\n\ncase sought to be set up by the appellant is that as\n\nmany as 272 string invertors were bearing duplicate\n\nnumbers and, therefore, it was being held out by the\n\nfirst respondent that it had performed its contractual\n\nobligation, when it was not the case. As far as the\n\ndelay   of   53   days    in   fulfilling     the    conditions\n\nsubsequent is concerned, there is no dispute that there\n\nwas such a delay. Though, an attempt was made by the\n\nfirst   respondent   to   contend     that   in    view   of   the\n\namendment    substituting       one    of    the     conditions\n\nsubsequent, viz., the condition relating to land and,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_269\">                               144</span>\n\ftherefore, there would be further extension of time.\n\nWe do not think that we can allow the first respondent\n\nto   set   up   such   a    plea.   However,    we    have    already\n\nconcluded that the issue as to the right or power of\n\nthe appellant to terminate the PPA on account of the\n\ndelay of 53 days, may not be open to the appellant, in\n\nview of the Judgment of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_172\">107. The    learned        Senior   Counsel     for     the    first\n\nrespondent, Dr. A.M. Singhvi, would, in fact, contend\n\nthat this Court may proceed on the basis that actually\n\nthere is a disputed question of fact. This is on the\n\nreasoning that even if this Court proceeds on the basis\n\nof the Inspection Report dated 19.04.2018, a miniscule\n\npercentage of Rs. 350 crores would be the subject\n\nmatter of the lacunae that was pointed out by the\n\nInspecting Team in its Report dated 19.04.2018. It is\n\npointed out that the first respondent should not be\n\nvisited with the highly arbitrary decision to terminate\n\nthe PPA when nearly Rs. 350 crores have been sunk into\n\nthe project. The project itself is an environment\n\nfriendly    project.        An   unusually     large    number    of\n\ncompetitors had bid in the bidding process and the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_270\">                                 145</span>\n\ffirst respondent had emerged as a lowest bidder, which,\n\nat that time was hailed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">\nTHE CASE UNDER ARTICLE 9.1 READ WITH ARTICLE 9.4(a)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\">108. One of the grounds taken by the first respondent\n\nagainst the termination notices is that it is issued\n\nwithout complying with <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_267\">Article 9.1</a> of the PPA. We have\n\nalready adverted to the said Article. We have also\n\nreferred to Article 9.4.(a). Let us divine what is\n\ncontemplated   under    the    PPA.   The   PPA   contemplates\n\n<a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 9</a> with its sub-divisions to provide for events\n\nof default and remedies. Under <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 9</a>, the sub-\n\nArticles provide for seller’s event of default and the\n\nappellant’s Event of default. Reading <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 9.1</a> with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_271\">Article 9.4</a> and, more particularly, <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_272\">Article 9.4.</a>(a),\n\nwhich alone is relevant, we understand the following\n\nto be what is contemplated by the parties. <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_273\">Article 9.1</a>\n\nbegins with the words ‘in case of default’. The default\n\nin the case of seller’s event of default would be the\n\ndefault,   which   is    the     subject    matter    of   the\n\ntermination. Here, we can safely conclude that the\n\nseller’s event of default, which is apposite, is the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_271\">                              146</span>\n\ffailure    to   commence    the   supply   of   power   to   the\n\nappellant at the contracted capacity, relevant to the\n\nscheduled commissioning date by the end of twenty-four\n\nmonths. The words ‘scheduled commissioning date’, have\n\nbeen defined in the PPA itself, to mean, for solar\n\nproject of capacity 50MW as per the quantum indicated\n\nin LOI, the commissioning period allowed shall be\n\nnineteen months from the date of signing of the PPA.\n\nThe period of twenty-four months must be reckoned from\n\nthe date of the PPA and, so understood, since the date\n\nof the PPA is 18.09.2015, twenty-four months therefrom\n\nwould expire on 18.09.2017. We, therefore, proceed on\n\nthe basis that such an event, constituting default on\n\nthe part of the first respondent, had taken place.\n\nContinuing with the analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_274\">Article 9.1</a>, what was\n\nexpected of the appellant was, as the non-defaulting\n\nparty, to issue a default notice to the defaulting\n\nparty, viz., the seller, which in this case is the\n\nfirst     respondent.      <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_275\">Article   9.1</a>    further     clearly\n\ncontemplates that if the default is not fully set right\n\nwithin three months from the date of issue of the\n\ndefault notice, then, in the case of default by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">                              147</span>\n\fseller, the appellant was to serve a seven days’ notice\n\nof termination. The notice was, undoubtedly, to be in\n\nwriting. It is by the second notice, which is to be of\n\nthe duration of seven days that the appellant could\n\nvalidly terminate the agreement. Thus, PPA clearly\n\nindicates the issuance of a default notice when seller\n\ncommits an act of default. Without issuing the first\n\ndefault notice, giving three months’ time from the date\n\nof issue of the notice, the second notice, which would\n\nbe a notice of termination, cannot be issued.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\">109. Now, let us find whether the appellant has followed\n\nthis procedure. In the impugned termination notice\n\ndated 07.07.2018, what is indicated in a Table in\n\nparagraph-9 is that there was a delay of 54 days in\n\nthe matter of fulfilment of conditions subsequent and\n\nthe scheduled commercial operation date, as per <a href=\"/doc/817828/\" id=\"a_276\">Article\n\n2.6</a> was 14.04.2017. 11.08.2017 is noted as the date of\n\nnotice of termination. 18.09.2017, being the end of\n\ntwenty-four months from the date of signing of the PPA\n\nis shown as the last date of commencement of supply of\n\nthe contracted capacity and <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 9.4</a> is referred to.\n\n18.12.2017 is shown as the expiry date of three months,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                          148</span>\n\fapparently, from 18.09.2017, for commencement of supply\n\nfrom the last due date. Thereafter, 25.12.2017 is shown\n\nas the expiry date of seven days of the PPA termination\n\nnotice period. In paragraphs-21, 22 and 23 of the\n\nimpugned notices, the appellant takes the following\n\nstand:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_176\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">         “21.

In paragraph-23, it is explicitly stated\n\nthat based on Article 2.1.1(d) along with the timeline\n\nstipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 9.1</a> and the show-cause notice\n\ndated 22.02.2017, the PPA was terminated.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\">111. Therefore, the show-cause notice dated 22.02.2017\n\nis what the appellant lays store by to conclude that\n\nit was acting in compliance with the requirement of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">                         150</span>\n\fissuance of the default notice under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 9.1.</a> It,\n\ntherefore, becomes necessary to advert to the notice\n\ndated 22.02.2017.

It is\n\n    clearly mentioned that as per Article 2.5.1, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">                               153</span>\n\fPPA     was   liable     for     termination.   The    first\n\nrespondent was asked for the explanation within\n\nten days from the date of the letter for further\n\nnecessary action in the matter.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">We are of the view that the said notice cannot\n\nqualify as one which was issued as a default notice\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_282\">Article 9.1.</a> We have already found that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_283\">Article 9.1</a>, dealing with default, which in this\n\ncase,    is   the      default    by   the   seller,   and,\n\nfurthermore, the default being non-observance of\n\nthe time limit of twenty-four months from the date\n\nof agreement dated 18.09.2015, the notice dated\n\n22.02.2017, could not have been issued, even before\n\nthe expiry of the period of twenty-four months from\n\n18.09.2015. In other words, the seller’s event of\n\ndefault under <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_284\">Article 9.4(a)</a> could have become the\n\nsubject matter of a notice under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_285\">Article 9.1</a> only\n\nif there was failure on the part of the first\n\nrespondent to supply power, as provided in <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_286\">Article\n\n9.4(a)</a>, within twenty-four months. That point of\n\ntime, viz., the expiry of twenty-four months from\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">                          154</span>\n\f18.09.2015, would arrive, at the earliest, only on\n\n18.09.2017. Therefore, it is only after 18.09.2017\n\nthat the first notice or, what is described as the\n\ndefault notice, could have been issued by the\n\nrespondent under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_287\">Article 9.1.</a> Apparently, what has\n\nhappened is the appellant has combined the default\n\nalleged with reference to Article 2.5.1(d), to\n\nwhich, undoubtedly, notice dated 22.02.2017, could\n\nbe said to be related and has projected the said\n\nshow-cause notice as the default notice within the\n\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_288\">Article 9.1</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 9.4.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\"><a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_290\">Article 9.1</a> contemplates a default, the issuance\n\nof default notice and, most importantly, giving a\n\nperiod     of   three       months   for   the    seller   (first\n\nrespondent) to set right things. It is if the\n\nseller does not remedy the matter within three\n\nmonths,     that     the       second      notice,    which   is\n\nessentially an Order of termination of the PPA,\n\ncan   be   issued.      A    perusal of     the    notice dated\n\n22.02.2017 does not make any reference to the\n\nseller’s event of default contemplated in Article\n\n9.4.(a). The reasons are not far to seek. For the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                              155</span>\n\freasons, which we have indicated hereinbefore, the\n\nnotice could not have been issued based on there\n\nbeing a seller’s default within the meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_291\">Article 9.4.</a>(a) on 22.02.2017. We reiterate that\n\nas on 22.02.2017, the seller’s event of default\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_292\">Article 9.4.</a>(a), could not exist in law or\n\nin facts. Still further, we notice from the tenor\n\nof the notice dated 22.02.2017 that the first\n\nrespondent   was,     in    fact,   asked   to   give   its\n\njustification within ten days from the date of\n\nissue of the notice for necessary action in the\n\nmatter.   This   is   totally    incompatible    with   the\n\nnotice contemplated as a default notice within the\n\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_293\">Article 9.1.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_294\">Article 9.1</a> contemplates\n\nthe existence of a default by the seller and the\n\ngiving of a period of three months to the seller\n\nto remove the defect. We are unable to understand\n\nhow notice dated 22.02.2017 could be understood as\n\naffording any such opportunity as is contemplated\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_295\">Article 9.1.</a> Therefore, we have no hesitation\n\nin holding that the appellant cannot seek shelter\n\nunder notice dated 22.02.2017 to justify the notice\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                           156</span>\n\f       of termination dated 07.07.2018, if reliance is to\n\n       be placed on <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 9.1</a> read with Article 9.4.(a).\n\n       We have already found that the appellant cannot be\n\n       permitted to reopen the issue relating to the non-\n\n       fulfilment of the conditions subsequent, as the\n\n       issue   has   attained   finality   by   virtue   of   the\n\n       Judgment of the High Court dated 20.06.2018.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_184\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1831036\" id=\"span_282\">113. Appellant has attempted to justify the notice dated\n\n22.02.2017 as the show-cause notice within the meaning\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_297\">Article 9.1</a> based on the Judgment of the High Court\n\nin the first round of litigation. We are of the view\n\nthat    appellant    would   not   be   justified   in   drawing\n\nsupport from the said Judgment to contend that the\n\nissuance of notice dated 22.02.2017, would suffice and\n\nit absolves the appellant from complying with <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_298\">Article\n\n9.1.</a> From a perusal of the said Judgment in Writ\n\nPetition No. 12880 of 2017, we find that the High Court\n\nfound that an attempt was made by the appellant to\n\njustify the earlier termination dated 11.08.2017 on the\n\nground that respondent had not commissioned the power\n\nproject within the time fixed in the agreement. The\n\nHigh Court was not impressed as it found that the lack\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">                                157</span>\n\fof commissioning of the power project was not the\n\nreason for terminating the contract and the appellant\n\ncould not supplement the reason in view of Judgment of\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1831036/\" id=\"a_299\">Mohinder Singh Gill and another v. Chief\n\nElection Commissioner, New Delhi</a> and others35. It is\n\nthereafter,     after   setting       aside   the   Order   dated\n\n11.08.2017, that liberty was granted to the appellants\n\nto pass fresh Order in terms of the PPA, in accordance\n\nwith law. High Court, therefore, only permitted the\n\nappellants to invoke the PPA with respect to the lack\n\nof commissioning, and moreover, in accordance with law.\n\nIt becomes clear as day light that since by the date\n\nof    the   Judgment,   i.e.,    20.06.2018,    the   period   of\n\ntwenty-four months from the date of the agreement, had\n\nexpired, and if, in terms of the liberty granted by the\n\nHigh Court, the appellant was to lawfully terminate the\n\ncontract, it could not have acted in breach of the\n\nmandate of the PPA, which, in fact, the High Court had\n\nspecifically directed appellant to comply with. In\n\nother words, though nearly nine months had gone by from\n\n18.09.2017, when the High Court pronounced Judgment on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">35</span>\n     (1978) 1 SCC 405\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                                158</span>\n\f20.06.2018, if the appellant wanted to terminate the\n\nagreement, at least under the contract, the appellant\n\nwas obliged to issue the default notice. As we have\n\nnoticed, the appellant was perhaps persuaded to issue\n\nthe impugned termination notice on the basis of the\n\nearlier notice dated 22.02.2017 as it felt that it was\n\nentitled to ask the Court to revisit the issue relating\n\nto the non-fulfilment of the condition subsequent as\n\nwell. The appellant has, in fact, proceeded in the\n\nnotice of termination that the three months period,\n\ncontemplated    in    <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_300\">Article     9.1</a>,    came   to     an    end\n\nautomatically, on 18.12.2017 and things had not changed\n\non the ground, entitling it to issue the notice dated\n\n07.07.2018, after the further expiry of seven days on\n\n25.12.2017. The appellant, in this regard, appears to\n\nhave laboured under the apprehension that the mere\n\nexpiry   of   the   period   of   three   months,     after   the\n\noccurring of the event of seller default, within the\n\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_301\">Article 9.4.</a>(a) and the further expiry of\n\nanother seven days, entitled it to issue the notice of\n\ntermination. What, on the other hand, <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_302\">Article 9.1</a> read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_303\">Article 9.4.</a>(a) contemplated was not the mere\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                             159</span>\n\frunning of time for a period of three months, after the\n\noccurrence of the seller’s event of default but an\n\nopportunity to the seller by the giving of a notice of\n\ndefault and waiting for three months. It is only after\n\nthe seller was put on notice of the default, which it\n\nhad committed and an opportunity was granted to remove\n\nfully the default and it persevered in breach, that a\n\nvalid Order of termination could be passed. On this\n\nreasoning, there can be no dispute that the appellant\n\nhas clearly failed to act in terms of the clear mandate\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_304\">Article 9.1</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_305\">Article 9.4.</a>(a).</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">114. There is another vital aspect to be borne in mind.\n\nThe impugned notice dated 11.08.2017, brought about the\n\ntermination of the contract. This is while notice dated\n\n04.07.2017 was issued by         the first respondent, as\n\nnoticed. Therein, the appellant was specifically asked\n\nto inspect the premises. The CEIG also issued the\n\ncertificate on 09.08.2017. Now the really significant\n\nfact   is   that   after   the   appellant   terminated   the\n\ncontract on 11.08.2017, it is wholly inconceivable and\n\narbitrary to predicate that the first respondent should\n\nhave commenced the project and complied with <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_306\">Article\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">                             160</span>\n\f9.4(a)</a> by 18.09.2017. Even more unfair it would be to\n\nfind that the first respondent had three months period\n\nfrom 18.09.2017 to cure the defect which period came\n\nto an end on 18.12.2017. Yet, this very premise is\n\nreflected in the impugned notice dated 07.07.2018.\n\nThere    is   no     case     at   all    for    the    appellant      that\n\nimmediately on the expiry of 24 months contemplated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_307\">Article 9.4(a)</a>, a notice was given under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_308\">Article 9.1.</a>\n\nThis    could    not    be,    also      for    the    reason   that    the\n\nappellant had well before 18.09.2017, on 11.08.2017,\n\nterminated the contract. This is indisputable. Equally\n\nsignificantly,         termination        of    the     contract      dated\n\n11.08.2017 clearly was illegal though it was found\n\nlater and set          aside by judgment dated               20.06.2018.\n\nThus, we cannot also brush aside the complaint of the\n\nfirst respondent that this is a case where it stood\n\nprevented from commencing supply within the meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_309\">Article 9.4(a).</a> The fact of termination by order dated\n\n11.08.2017 and its invalidation by the High court on\n\n20.06.2018 are again not matters of dispute.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">115. There      is   another       aspect       to    the   matter.     The\n\ntermination of a contract, undoubtedly, results in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                                   161</span>\n\fintrusion into and deprivation of valuable rights,\n\nwhich are vouchsafed to the awardee of the contract.\n\nIt could be argued that dehors a contractual provision,\n\nunless it be that the contract peremptorily provides\n\nfor the termination of the contract expressly without\n\nservice of the notice on the occurrence of certain\n\nstipulated events, principles of natural justice may\n\nnot be out of place and under the Theory of Fair State\n\nAction, in consonance with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 14</a>, an opportunity\n\nto the awardee as to why the contract should not be\n\nterminated,    may   be   just.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60084250\" id=\"span_289\">In   this   regard,   we   may\n\nrecapitulate what this Court in <a href=\"/doc/60084250/\" id=\"a_311\">State of U.P. v.

If it is a case where it is demonstrated\n\nthat removal of the default was an impossibility,\n\nthen, it would, indeed, be a futile exercise and\n\nperhaps, at least, in a writ proceeding based on\n\ninfraction of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_318\">Article 14</a> or that the action is\n\narbitrary, the Court may have refused to exercise\n\nthe extraordinary jurisdiction and relegate the\n\nparty to other forum to seek whatever relief it\n\nmay be entitled to.

The choice of the word ‘may’\n\nimporting    discretion      in    <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_335\">Article       9.1</a>   is    in   stark\n\ncontrast with Article 2.5.1 (d).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_301\">                                  171</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">\f122. Apparently, it was so drafted so that in an event\n\nlike   in    a    seller      event   of     default      under    <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_336\">Article\n\n9.4.</a>(a), i.e., failure by the seller to supply power\n\nwithin 24 months, bearing in mind the nature of project\n\nand the stakes involved for both the appellant and the\n\nseller, there may be cases where the seller may wish\n\nto   grant       more   time    so    that      a    project     which   has\n\nprogressed to a state of near completion may not be\n\naborted by the termination and grant of time would, on\n\nthe other hand, witness the full blossoming of the\n\nproject.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">123. It would appear that the appellant did not carry\n\nout any inspection. The inspection carried out by the\n\nCEIG in first week of August, 2017 was an inspection\n\nconducted by the five-member team and it is further\n\nclaimed      that   this      inspection        lasted    for     3-4    days\n\nbeginning from 01.08.2017. The CEIG has certified that\n\nthe project was ready and that the first respondent can\n\nproceed with the commissioning activity.                        We bear in\n\nmind that the period of twenty-four months contemplated\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_337\">Article 9.4(a)</a>, would expire only on 18.09.2017. The\n\nCEIG   has    given     its    Report      on       09.08.2017    that   the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_302\">                                     172</span>\n\fproject was ready for commissioning. The factum of the\n\nReport cannot be treated as a disputed question of fact\n\nas it is covered by a document. In fact, we find that,\n\nthe appellant proceeded on the basis admittedly that\n\nit was reliable, but, however, on 11.08.2017 issued the\n\ntermination notice solely based on non-fulfilment of\n\nconditions subsequent. This notice stood set aside on\n\n20.06.2018. Maybe the manner in which the inspection\n\nwas carried out and the pitfalls in the same may be\n\ncharacterised as the disputed questions of facts. Also,\n\nthough the appellant was invited to carry out the\n\ninspection on 04.07.2017, the appellant carried out the\n\ninspection only on 19.04.2018 and the Report was dated\n\n21.04.2018.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_208\">124. If we go by the Report of the CEIG, the project of\n\nthe respondent would appear to have been completed for\n\nthe purposes of effecting commissioning. It may be\n\nanother   matter   that   other   formalities   had   to   be\n\ncompleted. When the team of the appellant carried out\n\nthe physical inspection, (it was done on 19.04.2018),\n\nthe appellant’s team also substantially endorsed the\n\nReport of the CEIG. However, it was found that a certain\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_303\">                            173</span>\n\fnumber of string inverters inter alia, were not found\n\nat many locations in Block Nos. 9 and 10. It was found\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_209\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">           “4. Any other specified observation in\n           respect of installation of solar P.V plant\n\n\n           In block 9 and 10, string inverters were not\n           found at many location but those location\n           had solar panels installed interconnections\n           of PV panel (cabling) string work at there\n           location are not found connected with each\n           other Further, at some location the cable\n           and earthing work is observed incomplieto &amp;\n           suspended.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">125. It is here that we must notice the case of the\n\nfirst respondent to be that though the equipment was\n\ninstalled as certified in the Report of the CEIG and\n\nwhat remained was formal connectivity to the grid upon\n\nwhich commissioning certificate would be issued, the\n\nfinal event remained on account of non-issuance of\n\nconnectivity code for connection to the grid. It is\n\nwhile    so,   when   the    challenge   against   the    first\n\ntermination notice was under consideration and there\n\nwas     demobilisation      of    manpower,   certain    string\n\ninverters were stolen, the cost of which is stated to\n\nbe Rs.172000     per string inverter. Based on safety\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">                                 174</span>\n\fconcerns, the equipment was, according to the first\n\nrespondent, removed and kept in safe custody. The first\n\nrespondent has laid store by two first information\n\nreports lodged. The first FIR was lodged on 12.09.2017\n\nand another FIR was lodged on 04.03.2018 relating to\n\nthe theft of certain equipments. This is a case where\n\nthe first respondent has alleged that it has already\n\ninvested Rs.331 crores.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">126. We will proceed on the basis that there was a CEIG\n\nReport dated 09.08.2017 certifying that the project of\n\nthe first respondent was complete. This is well before\n\n18.09.2017,   which       was      the   date       by     which     the\n\ncommissioning had to be done. It is also clear that the\n\ncommissioning,    as     such,     was   not    completed.         Still\n\nfurther, if we go by the CEIG Report, the case of the\n\nfirst   respondent     of     it    being      on    the    verge    of\n\ncommissioning could not be brushed aside as wanting in\n\nbonafides or merit. Still further, there is a case of\n\nthe   appellant   that      the    inspection       carried    out   on\n\n19.04.2018,   resulting       in    Report     dated       21.04.2018,\n\nrevealed certain deficiencies in the form of missing\n\ninverters inter alia from Block Nos. 9 and 10 inter\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">                                  175</span>\n\falia. First respondent has a case of thefts occurring.\n\nIn fact, the first respondent has a definite case that\n\nabout 39 inverters involved were also replaced in June,\n\n2018 based on Purchase Order of May 2018 [See Annexure\n\nR12 produced before the High Court in Review Petition\n\nNo.682 of 2020]. This is even before 07.07.2018.     No\n\ndoubt, the appellant has a case that the FIRs relied\n\non by the first respondent did not refer to inverters.\n\nAs to whether, it was a result of thefts that the\n\ninverters etc. which were already there as on the date\n\nof the CEIG inspection went subsequently missing or as\n\nto whether it was as a result of the Report of the CEIG\n\nbeing flawed and, therefore, the inverters etc. were\n\nnot there in the first place, even as on the date of\n\nthe CEIG Report, appears to us to be a disputed question\n\nof fact. We proceed on the basis that the inverters in\n\nquestion were not there. But as noticed, about 39\n\nstolen invertors were already replaced in June 2018.\n\nAt any rate, if a default notice had been given pointing\n\nout this aspect, the matter could possibly be put right\n\nwithin three months of such a notice. We recall here\n\nthe few complaints (essentially two in number) which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">                          176</span>\n\fremained   of    Respondent         No.5.      It   could     have     been\n\npointed out as part of aspect of default if it was so\n\nunderstood.          We   have      also    found     that    the    joint\n\ninspection      of    the    respondent        No.4    had     found    on\n\n24.08.2017 that the line may be charged.                     What we can\n\nfind is only that this is not a case where the first\n\nrespondent could be said to be in a position where it\n\ncould be said that it would be unable to comply with\n\nthe terms of the default notice if it was warranted.\n\nIn other words, if as on 07.07.2018, instead of issuing\n\na termination notice, if notice had been given within\n\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_338\">Article 9.1</a>, it is quite possible that\n\nthe first respondent would have remedied the defect as\n\nalleged.     We have also noted that even in 2017, no\n\nnotice   was    given       under    <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_339\">Article    9.1</a>     and    even     the\n\ncontract was terminated illegally as found by the High\n\nCourt by notice dated 11.08.2017. The whole idea behind\n\nthe default notice under <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 9.1</a> was lost sight of\n\nby the appellant. We have unravelled also, the impact\n\nof the use of the word ‘may’ in <a href=\"/doc/1507561/\" id=\"a_341\">Article 9.1.</a> The action\n\nof the appellant in departing from unambiguous regime\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">                                    177</span>\n\fof the PPA without any justification would make its\n\nactions arbitrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">127. The other aspect projected by the appellant is what\n\nwas projected in the Review Petition filed before the\n\nHigh Court. It was contended essentially as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">        The first respondent had committed a fraud on\n\n    the Office of the Chief Electrical Inspector, the\n\n    appellant and on the Court. It was alleged that\n\n    the project was divided into 10 blocks of 5MW each\n\n    and each Block of 5MW would have 116/117 Inverters\n\n    approximately.   Each of the Inverter was to have a\n\n    unique distinctive serial number. Each inverter\n\n    was to have 43KV rating, as indicated in the CEIG\n\n    Report. The fraud consisted of a discovery by the\n\n    appellant on an alleged ‘detailed’ analysis of the\n\n    serial numbers of the inverters, that in each\n\n    Block, there were several Inverters having numbers\n\n    which were common/duplicate and interchangeably\n\n    used in the same or other blocks. It was alleged\n\n    that for about 186 Invertors serial numbers were\n\n    commonly,   duplicably   and   interchangeably   used.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">    Some of the inverter numbers were not legible.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">                          178</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">\f       Therefore, it was alleged that there was lack of\n\n       due diligence by the authorised personnel of the\n\n       CEIG.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_213\">128. In this regard, the first respondent has countered\n\nthe    case    of     the   appellant      not   only   by    producing\n\ninvoices supplied by the overseas supplier and the bill\n\nof entry issued by the Customs Department but the Lorry\n\nReceipts,       to     establish     the     procurement      of     1175\n\nInverters required for the first respondent Unit in\n\n2017. It is also their case that the inverter serial\n\nnumbers themselves carry no significance. They were\n\nmere identifiers for the purpose of record keeping,\n\nwarranty claims, etc. All the 1163 Inverters installed\n\nby    the     first    respondent      had   identical       mechanical\n\nspecification and the mere mention of incorrect serial\n\nnumbers in the Report of the CEIG did not establish\n\nthat the first respondent was not ready to commission\n\nthe project. The first respondent also has pointed out\n\nthat    on     learning     of   the     duplication     of    the    few\n\ninverters serial numbers in the Report of the CEIG, it\n\npromptly approached the CEIG on 16.09.2020 with details\n\nof     the     correct      unique     serial    numbers      and     the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">                                   179</span>\n\fcorresponding location of the inverters. It requested\n\nthe CEIG to inspect and verify the inverters and to\n\nissue   a    corrigendum        to    the     first    Report       dated\n\n09.08.2017.       In    fact,   there    is    reference      to    first\n\nrespondent    in       compliance     with    the     first    impugned\n\nJudgment writing to the CEIG earlier on 15.04.2020, to\n\nvisit the project site for reissuing/revalidating the\n\napproval    for    commissioning        the    project,       since   the\n\nvalidity of the first report dated 09.08.2017 had\n\nlapsed. It is specifically contended in the reply to\n\nthe Review Petition that due to non-cooperation of the\n\nappellant     on       the   excuse     of    Covid-19,       the     CEIG\n\ninspection could not be undertaken. This stand is\n\nreiterated, in fact, in the counter affidavit in this\n\nCourt also. It would appear that the first respondent\n\nhad deposited the inspection fee of Rs.66,14,000/-\n\nwhich is said to be equipment based meaning thereby\n\nthat it was paid reckoning all the inverters.                  It would\n\nappear that no inspection has been carried by the CEIG\n\nbased on the request for revisit. As far as this aspect\n\nis concerned, apart from the fact that the CEIG has\n\nconducted     an       inspection     and     given    a   Report      on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">                                 180</span>\n\f09.08.2017, certifying the readiness of the Unit of the\n\nfirst respondent, the first respondent has produced\n\ndocuments like invoices from overseas sellers, bill of\n\nentry with the Customs Department and certain lorry\n\nreceipts.    The alleged fraud is the common number found\n\nin 186 inverters in the Report of the CEIG. A physical\n\ninspection by the CEIG, which was necessitated in terms\n\nof    the    original        Judgement,    at    any    rate,     for\n\nrevalidation of the Report was and is necessary and\n\ninevitable     even     if    the   appeals     fail.   The     first\n\nrespondent had alerted the CEIG for the need for a\n\nreinspection for ascertaining the aspect relating to\n\nduplication in numbers. It              would appear    that such\n\ninspection has not been carried out. In this regard,\n\nit is important to notice that the appellant carried\n\nout an inspection on 19.04.2018 and it had not found\n\nout any such discrepancy as it has not projected in\n\nregard to the aspect of common numbers or illegibility\n\nof numbers, in the inverters, in its Report dated\n\n21.04.2018. At any rate, the PPA clearly provided for\n\nthe   issuance    of     a    default     notice,   providing      an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                                 181</span>\n\fopportunity to remove the defect. This obligation has\n\nbeen observed in its breach.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">129. Therefore, we would find that an inspection by the\n\nCEIG would necessarily have to be carried out in which\n\nthe appellant would have to be involved to facilitate\n\nthe exercise. In the facts of this case, on being\n\nsatisfied, the CEIG would necessarily have to grant the\n\nre-validation of the earlier Report. It would also\n\ninvolve an opportunity to the CEIG to look into the\n\naspects     which     have    been    projected      by    the    fist\n\nrespondent itself in its letter dated 16.09.2020. The\n\nreport would indeed indicate the state of affairs about\n\nall the facets. As already noticed, even under the\n\nimpugned     Judgement       dated     27.02.2020,        the    first\n\nrespondent would have to submit necessary applications.\n\nWe   only   clarify    that    it    may   involve   removing      any\n\nremaining deficiencies with the fifth respondent.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">130. It may not be wholly irrelevant to notice the\n\nfollowing aspect which is reflected in the counter\n\naffidavit filed by the respondent No.1 before this\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">                                182</span>\n\f     “It is of utmost importance to mention here\n     that while the challenge to the 2018\n     Termination    Notice    was   pending,   the\n     Petitioner had proposed a so-called amicable\n     resolution of the dispute with the Respondent\n     No.1 and convened a meeting for this purpose\n     on February 6, 2020.      Occurrence of this\n     meeting and the discussions held are recorded\n     at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Impugned Order\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">     1. During this meeting, the Petitioner had\n     attempted to impress upon the Respondent No.1\n     to explore ‘Third Party Sale’ from the\n     project or, agree to a reduction in tariff\n     in line with the recent auctions conducted\n     by SECI for other solar power projects.\n     Respondent No.1 had rejected both the option\n     of ‘third Party Sale’ or, the attempts to\n     reduce tariff specified in <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_342\">Article 9.7</a> of the\n     PPA,   which   was    discovered  through   a\n     transparent competitive bidding process. The\n     very fact that the Petitioner had proposed\n     to the respondent No.1 to explore sale of\n     power from the Project to third parties is\n     proof enough that the Project was complete\n     and ready for commissioning.”\n\n    In this regard, we may notice paragraph 4 of the\n\nminutes of the meeting dated 06.02.2020 which reads as\n\nfollows: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">     “4. MPPMCL further stated that, as the\n     commissioning of the project has been\n     substantially delayed and, in the meantime\n     solar binding tariffs have been considerable\n     reduced up to Rs. 2.61/ Unit for which MPPMCL\n     has already entered into PPAs, therefore\n     MPPMCL offered M/s Sky Power to supply power\n     at reduced tariff of the project was the\n     lowest in the bid and their investment was\n     made during the FY 2016-2017 therefore,\n     supplying power to MPPMCL at reduced tariff\n     will not be viable hence not possible.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                         183</span>\n\f    We would think that essentially the appellant’s\n\nattempt was to secure a reduction in the rate. The rate\n\nof the first respondent was found to be the lowest after\n\na clearly keenly competitive international bidding,\n\ninvolving a large number of bidders.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">131. In the totality of facts, we would, therefore,\n\nthink that though for reasons, which may not be the\n\nsame as in the impugned judgment, we need not interfere\n\nwith the view taken by the High Court. The appeals fail\n\nand are dismissed. Parties to bear their own costs.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">                               ………………………………………………………J.\n                               [ K.M.
