The respondent refunded the\n\n     advance of Rs. 4,49,55,000/- to the petitioner on the ground of breach\n\n     of contract by the petitioner failing to establish a Letter of Credit\n\n     leading to termination of the contract.

On the\n\n     same day, the Learned Civil Judge (Sr. Division) 4th Court, Alipore\n\n     granted an ad-interim injunction restraining the respondents not to\n\n     deal with or disposing of or alienating or encumbering or creating any\n\n     third party right or interest or from removing the goods from the vessels\n\n     M.V.

Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order dated 25th April, 2022,\n\n     the respondent has preferred an appeal before the Hon&#x27;ble Division\n\n     Bench of this Court being FMAT No. 137 of 2022 along with an\n\n     application being CAN No. 1 of 2022 praying for stay of the operation of\n\n     the order dated 25th April, 2022. The Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench has\n\n     passed an interim order by giving liberty to the respondent to remove\n\n     entire consignment after retaining 10,000 MT of LAM Coke in favour of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        5</span>\n\n\n     the petitioner. The appeal preferred by the respondent as well as the\n\n     application was disposed of by way of consent order dated 28th April,\n\n     2022. As per order dated 28th April, 2022, the petitioner made 10%\n\n     advance payment of Rs. 4,49,55,000/- to the respondent on 30th April,\n\n     2022 and the petitioner also sent an email to the respondent recording\n\n     payment details and seeking confirmation of draft Letter of Credit. By\n\n     an email dated 2nd May, 2022, the respondent acknowledged the 10% of\n\n     the advance payment and forwarded a revised draft Letter of Credit to\n\n     the petitioner requesting the petitioner to open Letter of Credit.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">7.   By an email dated 2nd May, 2022, the petitioner informed the\n\n     respondent that as per contract, the deal on High Sea Sale basis and\n\n     CFR mode. Since the goods have already unloaded and shifted at the\n\n     port, the sale can only be a GST sale, the bankers required an\n\n     addendum to the agreement date 22nd February, 2022 since it accounts\n\n     for High Sea Sale to open Letter of Credit. The petitioner can open\n\n     either Usance Letter of Credit or a Sight Letter of Credit, which can be\n\n     negotiated against GST Sale Invoice. The Expenses incurred at Haldia\n\n     Port can be added as per ton cost in GST invoice itself based on actual.\n\n     The respondent by an email dated 4th May, 2022 clarified that the value\n\n     of Letter of Credit must include GST. The agreement does not require\n\n     any amendment since it already contains provisions relating to GST\n\n     sale. The sight Letter of Credit would include GST Sale. The respondent\n\n     is in full agreement to supply 10,000 MT of Lam Coke out of 33,000\n\n     MT.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">8.   On 4th May, 2022, the petitioner informed the respondent that the draft\n\n     Letter of Credit received from the respondent on 2nd May, 2022 was\n\n     incomplete and defective on certain points. The petitioner further\n\n     informed that it is proceeding to open the sight Letter of Credit. In\n\n     terms of the order dated 28th April, 2022, the respondent has filed\n\n     affidavit of undertaking before the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench. On 6th May,\n\n     2022, the petitioner has provided two Letters of Credit. On receipt of\n\n     Letters of Credit, on the same day, the respondent by an email\n\n     informed the petitioner that the Letters of Credit proposed suffer from\n\n     serious anomalies i.e. (i) Payment is to be made through Letter of credit\n\n     based on invoice for the entire balance quantity of 9000 MT in one go,\n\n     instead of payments against material movement and (ii) The respondent\n\n     would not be able to issue lorry receipts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">9.   The petitioner has objected to the demand of the respondent for\n\n     payment of balance of 9000 MT in a single transaction akin to 100%\n\n     advance payment. The petitioner also informed to the respondent that\n\n     the demand of the respondent would result in defeating the purpose of\n\n     the Letter of Credit itself. The respondent has informed the petitioner\n\n     that there is hardly any reference to make payment phase wise or in\n\n     instalments in the contract. Receipt of payments in installments is not\n\n     acceptable to the respondent. The respondent reiterated its readiness to\n\n     deliver the balance quantity of 9000 MT against payment in terms of\n\n     the contract.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      7</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">10.

The petitioner also filed contempt\n\n    application against the respondent for non-compliance of the order\n\n    passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of this Court dated 28th April,\n\n    2022 by not permitting the petitioner to lift 10,000 MT of Lam Coke.\n\n    The petitioner has also filed an application before the Hon&#x27;ble Division\n\n    Bench of this Court for modification of the order dated 28th April, 2022\n\n    by deleting the direction pertaining to furnish bank guarantee of Rs. 5\n\n    Crores.

On receipt of\n\n    the said letter, the respondent has sent email to the petitioner with the\n\n    required modifications of the Letter of Credit in terms of the order dated\n\n    20th May, 2022. The petitioner by email dated 24th May, 2022, stated\n\n    that the mail sent by the respondent is illegal and contrary to the order\n\n    dated 20th May, 2022. It is also mentioned that the order merely directs\n\n    the respondent to send a request letter for amendment of Letter of\n\n    Credit from Sight Letter of Credit to Usance Letter of Credit and the\n\n    contents of the Letter of Credit is no within the domain of the\n\n    respondent.

The respondent by an email dated 27th May, 2022 informed the\n\n    petitioner that port handling and other charges remained unpaid, the\n\n    amendment of Sigh Letter of Credit to Usance Letter of Credit, only\n\n    keeping the contents therein unchanged is violation of the order dated\n\n    20th May, 2022 and the respondent while advising to amend Letter of\n\n    Credit from Sight to Usance, emphasized that necessary changes\n\n    incorporating discounting of the Letter of Credit within three days after\n\n    submission of original documents are required.

The respondent by an\n\n    email dated 30th May, 2022 informed the petitioner that the respondent\n\n    in several occasions by series of emails requested incorporation of\n\n    necessary amendments/ modifications in the Letter of Credit including\n\n    form Sight Letter of Credit to Usance Letter of Credit. The learned\n\n    Advocate for the respondent in terms of the order dated 20th May, 2022,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                      11</span>\n\n\n    provided the copy of undertaking filed before the Hon&#x27;ble Court by the\n\n    respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">13.

He submits that the\n\n    Arbitrator fails to decide the main issue referred to Arbitration by an\n\n    order dated 28th April, 2022, i.e. the question that which of the parties\n\n    had committed breach of the contract of sale dated 22nd February,\n\n    2022.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">23. He submits that the issue of non-compliance or breach of the second\n\n    consent order dated 20th May, 2022 as a substantive claim independent\n\n    of the issue of breach of the Contract dated 22nd February, 2022\n\n    knowing fully well that the contempt application with regard to the\n\n    breach of order dated 20th May, 2022 was pending before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n    High Court wherein a Rule had been issued against officials of the\n\n    respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">24.

He submits that in the suit, the claim of the\n\n    petitioner was whether under the contract dated 22nd February, 2022,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                      16</span>\n\n\n    the respondent was bound and liable to deliver the goods to the\n\n    petitioner at the contract price dated 21st April, 2022. The defence of\n\n    the respondent was that the respondent was not liable to deliver the\n\n    goods to the petitioner as the respondent terminated the contract on\n\n    14th April, 2022 and had refunded the advance amount of Rs. 4.49\n\n    crores to the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">25. In support of his submissions, Mr. Chinoy has relied upon the\n\n    judgment in the case of Union of India, through the General\n\n    Manager, Eastern Railway vs. Industrial Laminated (India) Pvt.\n\n    Ltd. report in 2017 SCC OnLine Cal 169 wherein the Coordinate\n\n    Bench of this Court held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                      &quot;11. In my opinion, when the learned\n                arbitrator, does not address the real dispute or\n                issues between the parties, he is trying to decide\n                something which is not referred to him. Or, in other\n                words he is not exercising the jurisdiction vested in\n                him.

Mr. Chinoy submits that the order dated 28th April, 2022 which\n\n    referred the disputes between the parties to arbitration, had only\n\n    provided a working arrangement for payment and delivery of the goods,\n\n    whilst the legal rights of the parties were being determined in\n\n    Arbitration and which arrangement was not intended to modify or affect\n\n    the rights and contentions of the parties under the Agreement dated\n\n    22nd February, 2022. He submits that if the consent order is modified\n\n    the date of performance/ rights of the parties under the contract dated\n\n    22nd February, 2022, there would have been no question of referring to\n\n    arbitration the issue of breach/ performance of the original contract as\n\n    there would have been no subsisting dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">27. Mr. Chinoy submits that the Arbitrator has at a number of places in\n\n    the Award held that the fact that the imposition of security by way of\n\n    bank guarantee and legal costs were added would not amount in itself\n\n    to superseding the original contract as these relate to payments under\n\n    the original contract and put the promisee in the same position as if the\n\n    contract had originally been performed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">28. Mr. Chinoy submits that the Award purports to deal with and decide\n\n    the issue of non-compliance/ breach of the second consent order dated\n\n    20th May, 2022 as a substantive claim independent of the issue of\n\n    breach of the contract dated 22nd February, 2022. He submits that\n\n    issue regarding non-compliance with the order dated 20th May, 2022\n\n    did not and could not have existed on the date of reference dated 28th\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                      18</span>\n\n\n    April, 2022. He submits that both the parties in their pleadings referred\n\n    to the orders dated 28th April, 2022 and 20th May, 2022 as a result of\n\n    which additional loss, damages, consequential upon the determination\n\n    of which party was in breach of contract dated 22nd February, 2022.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">29. He submits that the Award purports to consider and decides the issue\n\n    of non-compliance / breach of the consent order dated 20th May, 2022\n\n    as an issue, dehors from and independent of the issue of breach of\n\n    contract dated 22nd February, 2022. He submits that the Arbitrator has\n\n    decided the issue no.3 i.e. breach of consent order dated 20th May,\n\n    2022 as issue dehors from and independent of the issue of breach of\n\n    contract dated 22nd February, 2022, which vitiated under <a href=\"/doc/148869/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n\n    34(2)(a)(iv)</a> and also having decided beyond the pleadings of the parties.\n\n    In support of his submissions, Mr. Chinoy relied upon the judgment in\n\n    the case of National Housing Bank vs. ANZ Grindlays Bank PLC.\n\n    passed by the Bombay High Court in Arbitration Petition No. 1 of\n\n    1997 dated 4th February, 1998 and held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                      &quot;102. This was the pleadings on which the\n                parties went to trial. It is because of these\n                pleadings that no Issue has been raised as to\n                whether or not the 1st Respondents had become\n                the owners of the cheques or the proceeds thereof.\n                In my view, Mr. Parasaran is quite right when he\n                submits that there is no assertion of title as\n                &quot;payees&quot; or &quot;holders in due course&quot; either positively\n                or by reason of non-traverse. The pleadings show\n                that there is a disclaimer of title in themselves by\n                the 1st Respondents. The assertion is that it was\n                Mr. Harshad Mehta who was the intended\n                beneficiary of the cheques. The averment also is\n                that Mr. Harshad Mehta was the owner of the\n                cheques and the proceeds. The plea that the 1st\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                       19</span>\n\n\nRespondents as payees became true owners of the\ncheques is contrary to the positive case in\npleadings. It is a case on which parties did not go\nto trial and on which no Issue was raised. Even\nthough normally a person claiming conversion has\nto prove title or immediate right to possession, in\nthis case Petitioners&#x27; title to the cheques was\npositively accepted in the pleadings. Thus even\nunder Issue No. 12 the Petitioners did not need to\nlead evidence on this point. A new case, contrary to\npleadings, was made out for first time in\narguments. Undoubtedly this was done as 1st\nRespondents realised that they had failed to prove\nthe case pleaded by them. In allowing such an\nargument and upholding it there is an error\napparent on the face of the Award. The Award then\nproceeds on the basis that the 1st Respondents\nhad title to the cheques. It would therefore vitiate\nother portions of the Award also. Thus on this\nground also the Court would have to interfere.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      103. At this stage it must be mentioned that\nMr. Venugopal had, based upon Jajodia&#x27;s case,\nsubmitted that the Court could not look into the\npleadings as the pleadings had not been\nincorporated by the Arbitrators into the Award. I\nam unable to accept this submission. As seen, the\nArbitrators have in fact noted the respective case of\nthe parties not only at the beginning of the Award\nbut thereafter again while considering the case of\nconversion. The case has been set out again from\npage 169 of the Award onwards. Whilst setting out\nthe case of the 1st Respondents the Arbitrators do\nnot state that the 1st Respondents claimed that\nthey had become the true owners of the cheques.\nThe Arbitrators do not even state that by reason of\nnon-traverse such a case must be presumed. If the\nArbitrators had gone beyond and contrary to the\npleadings and the case on which parties went to\ntrial there would have been a jurisdictional error.\nThat would been a case falling under the ratio laid\ndown in Associated Engineering Co&#x27;s. case. As has\nbeen held in that case the Arbitrators cannot act\narbitrarily or independently of the contract or case\non which the parties go to trial. Their function is to\narbitrate in terms of the case with which the\nparties go to trial. If they travelled beyond this they\nwould be acting without jurisdiction. A conscious\ndisregard of the pleadings and specific case would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                     20</span>\n\n\n               vitiate the Award. In order to decide whether\n               Arbitrators have exceeded jurisdiction matters not\n               appearing on the face of the Award could be looked\n               at. It was thus open to the Court to see what was\n               the case with which parties went to trial. Even\n               otherwise, the Arbitrators set out Petitioners&#x27;\n               submission that this case is contrary to pleadings.\n               Arbitrators only say that disclaiming transactions\n               is not disclaiming title. However, the pleadings are\n               not just disclaiming transactions. In pleadings title\n               in themselves has been specifically disclaimed by\n               the 1st Respondents. There is error apparent on the\n               face of the Award.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"437381\" id=\"span_19\">30.

The words &quot;all\n               disputes&quot; in Clause 28.3 of the agreement can only\n               mean &quot;all disputes&quot; that might be in existence\n               when the arbitration clause is invoked and one of\n               the parties to the agreement gives the arbitration\n               notice to the other. In its present form Clause 28 of\n               the agreement cannot be said to be a one-time\n               measure and it cannot be held that once the\n               arbitration clause is invoked the remedy of\n               arbitration is no longer available in regard to other\n               disputes that might arise in future.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">31.

Mr. Chinoy without prejudiced to the contentions raised by him as\n\n    stated above, he submits that the award of damages of Rs.\n\n    5,60,00,000/- for breach of order dated 20th May, 2022, is ex-facie\n\n    contradictory, discloses errors apparent on the face of record and\n\n    virtually incomprehensible. He submits that the Award recorded that\n\n    the difference between the contract price of Rs. 46,000/- and market\n\n    price of the goods on 25th April, 2022 is Rs. 52,033/- when petitioner\n\n    had obtained the injunction was Rs. 5,600/- per Metric Ton and the\n\n    respondent was entitled to receive Rs. 5,60,00,000/- being the\n\n    difference in the price of 10,000 MT and the Award records that the\n\n    Market price of goods was Rs. 45,780.13 per Metric Ton on 14th June,\n\n    2022 and the respondent was entitled to receive the difference between\n\n    the Market price on 14th June, 2022 and the contract price which is Rs.\n\n    46,00,000 - Rs. 45,78,013 = Rs. 21,98,700/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">33.

He submits that it is\n\n    clearly contrary to the finding in paragraph 58 of the Award, the\n\n    Arbitrator in the final computation of damages Awarded at paragraph\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                      22</span>\n\n\n    59, the Arbitrator does not make and Award/ direct payment of\n\n    damages in accordance with his finding in paragraph 58. i.e. Rs.\n\n    21,98,000/- but instead makes an award directing payment of damages\n\n    for Rs. 5,60,00,000/- although the said amount is not even referred to,\n\n    considered or dealt with in paragraphs 55 to 58 of the Award.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">34.

He submits that order dated 20th May, 2022\n\n    required the petitioner to provide usance Letter of Credit and as per\n\n    Clause 3 the Letter of Credit would be discounted by the petitioner\n\n    through the petitioner&#x27;s bank within another 3 days after submission\n\n    of original, so as to enable payment being made by the petitioner to the\n\n    respondent within 3 days.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">35.

Mr. S.N.

No. 519 of\n\n    2022. The reference by the order dated 28th April, 2022 has to be read\n\n    in conjunction with the arbitration clause of the contract. He submits\n\n    that the reference to arbitration was not limited to breach of the\n\n    contract but also included any dispute arising out of the contract. He\n\n    submits that by reason of the order dated 20th May, 2022, the disputes\n\n    pertaining to non-compliance of the orders dated 28th April, 2022 and\n\n    20th May, 2022 were to be referred to the Arbitrator.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">37.

He submits that framing of such issues clearly shows that the\n\n    parties were ad idem that the consent orders recorded the revised and\n\n    agreed modalities for working out contract and were therefore germane.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"95111828\" id=\"span_23\">38.

Mr. Mookherjee relied upon the\n\n    judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/95111828/\" id=\"a_10\">Ssangyong Engineering and Construction\n\n    Company Limited Vs. National Highways Authority of India</a>\n\n    reported in (2019) 15 SCC 131 and submitted that as long as disputes\n\n    raised are within the ken of the arbitration agreement or the disputes\n\n    submitted to arbitration, they cannot be said to be disputes which are\n\n    either not contemplated by or which fall outside the scope of the\n\n    arbitration agreement.

He submits that the learned Arbitrator\n\n    has held that the contract was not superseded by the consent orders\n\n    but was only sought to be enforced by the consent orders. He submits\n\n    that the consent orders are agreements that are binding upon the\n\n    parties and is essentially a contract between the parties which derives\n\n    sanctity by the Court superseding its seal to the contract.

He submits that the\n\n    Learned Arbitrator came to a finding that Issue no.3 remained the only\n\n    significant issue in adjudicating the dispute, the finding cannot be\n\n    faulted in the proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and\n\n    Conciliation Act, 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">41.

Thereafter, several correspondences were\n\n    made between the parties but the Letter of Credit was not finalized and\n\n    by an email dated 31st May, 2022, the petitioner informed the\n\n    respondent that the petitioner is now proceeding to procure the\n\n    materials from the market for which the respondent would be liable for\n\n    all costs and consequences, damages suffered and to be suffered by the\n\n    petitioner by the illegal act and conduct and breach of the contract. By\n\n    the said email, the petitioner called upon the respondent to refund the\n\n    sum of Rs. 4,49,55,000/- being the 10% of the consideration value\n\n    remitted to the respondent on 30th April, 2022 and requested for\n\n    consent letter for closure and release of the Letters of Credit dated 6th\n\n    May, 2022 and the Bank Guarantee dated 12th May, 2022.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_137\">63.

The Arbitrator\n\n    further held that request for amending the Sight Letter of Credit into a\n\n    Usance Letter of Credit is in conformity with the direction of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n    Court but the petitioner has not complied with its obligation in terms of\n\n    the order dated 20th May, 2022 and on the other hand has illegally\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                        41</span>\n\n\n    terminated the contract though there was no violation on the part of\n\n    the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_139\">64.

By the\n\nconsent order dated 20th May, 2022 both the parties agreed with regard\n\nto the terms of payment and delivery of goods. Clause 10 of the\n\nContract provides for opening of Letter of Credit of the balance\n\npayment, issuance of delivery order upon receipt of full payment and\n\nother conditions. The Learned Arbitrator has decided issue no.3 with\n\nregard to any breach of the consent order dated 20th May, 2022. The\n\norder dated 20th May, 2022, is directly connected with Clause 10 of the\n\nAgreement   and    the   Hon&#x27;ble    Court   had   provided   for   working\n\narrangement for payment and delivery of the goods. Thus this Court\n\nfinds that the issue decided by the Learned Arbitrator squarely covered\n\nthe agreement dated 22nd February, 2022 and thus it cannot be said\n\nthat the Learned Arbitrator fails to decide the main issue with respect\n\nof the agreement dated 22nd February, 2022.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">\n    This Court considered the judgment relied by the petitioner in the\n\ncase of National Housing Bank (Supra) and the Industrial\n\nLaminates (India) Pvt.

Now the question whether the Learned Arbitrator has committed any\n\n    illegality for awarding damages in favor of the respondent and rejecting\n\n    the claim of the petitioner. By an order dated 25th April, 2022 in T.S.\n\n    No. 519 of 2022, the respondent was restrained form dealing with the\n\n    subject goods. In the said suit, the final relief of the petitioner is for\n\n    Specific Performance. In an appeal preferred by the respondent against\n\n    the order dated 28th April, 2022, the Hon&#x27;ble Court directed the\n\n    petitioner to furnish bank guarantee of Rs. 5 Crores as the respondents\n\n    was restrained from dealing with the goods. In the said order, the\n\n    Hon&#x27;ble Court protected        the respondent&#x27;s interest in      case the\n\n    respondent succeeds and the petitioner failed to open a Letter of Credit\n\n    in terms of the contract and was therefore not entitled to delivery of the\n\n    goods. In one hand, the petitioner has filed suit before the Civil Court\n\n    for specific Performance of Contract and obtained injunction and on the\n\n    other hand, the petitioner has filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 17</a> of\n\n    the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before the Learned Arbitrator\n\n    praying for the following relief:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">                 a.

Learned Arbitrator found that the petitioner is\n\n    guilty of non-compliance of the order dated 20th May, 2022 and it is the\n\n    duty of the Arbitrator to restore to the respondent, the loss suffered by\n\n    it for the order of injunction imposed against the respondent. The\n\n    Arbitrator also held that the litigant cannot take benefit of the interim\n\n    order after having lost on merit and the benefit so taken must be\n\n    restored to the other party who suffered such interim order.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                     46</span>\n\n\n    In the case of South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. Vs. Sate of M.P.\n\nand Others reported in (2003) 8 SCC 648, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n\nheld that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">                   &quot;28. That no one shall suffer by an act of the\n             court is not a rule confined to an erroneous act of\n             the court; the &quot;act of the court&quot; embraces within its\n             sweep all such acts as to which the court may form\n             an opinion in any legal proceedings that the court\n             would not have so acted had it been correctly\n             apprised of the facts and the law. The factor\n             attracting applicability of restitution is not the act of\n             the court being wrongful or a mistake or error\n             committed by the court; the test is whether on\n             account of an act of the party persuading the court\n             to pass an order held at the end as not\n             sustainable, has resulted in one party gaining an\n             advantage which it would not have otherwise\n             earned, or the other party has suffered an\n             impoverishment which it would not have suffered\n             but for the order of the court and the act of such\n             party. The quantum of restitution, depending on the\n             facts and circumstances of a given case, may take\n             into consideration not only what the party excluded\n             would have made but also what the party under\n             obligation has or might reasonably have made.\n             There is nothing wrong in the parties demanding\n             being placed in the same position in which they\n             would have been had the court not intervened by\n             its interim order when at the end of the proceedings\n             the court pronounces its judicial verdict which does\n             not match with and countenance its own interim\n             verdict. Whenever called upon to adjudicate, the\n             court would act in conjunction with what is real\n             and substantial justice. The injury, if any, caused\n             by the act of the court shall be undone and the gain\n             which the party would have earned unless it was\n             interdicted by the order of the court would be\n             restored to or conferred on the party by suitably\n             commanding the party liable to do so. Any opinion\n             to the contrary would lead to unjust if not\n             disastrous consequences. Litigation may turn into a\n             fruitful industry. Though litigation is not gambling\n             yet there is an element of chance in every litigation.\n             Unscrupulous litigants may feel encouraged to\n             approach the courts, persuading the court to pass\n             interlocutory orders favourable to them by making\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                     47</span>\n\n\n               out a prima facie case when the issues are yet to\n               be heard and determined on merits and if the\n               concept of restitution is excluded from application\n               to interim orders, then the litigant would stand to\n               gain by swallowing the benefits yielding out of the\n               interim order even though the battle has been lost\n               at the end. This cannot be countenanced. We are,\n               therefore, of the opinion that the successful party\n               finally held entitled to a relief assessable in terms\n               of money at the end of the litigation, is entitled to\n               be compensated by award of interest at a suitable\n               reasonable rate for the period for which the interim\n               order of the court withholding the release of money\n               had remained in operation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">69.
