The petition has been filed seeking appointment of an arbitrator by\n\ninvoking <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short the\n\n„Act‟).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">03.   It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner Company was awarded a\n\ncivil contract by the respondents for design and construction of a Single Lane\n\nBridge of 100 mtr long (4x2.500Mtr C/c of bearings, pre stressed concrete\n\nmemorable) on Krial-Rehal, for an amount of ₹ 385.00/- Lacsafter being the\n\nsuccessful bidder in the NIT dated 11.01.2004.As per the contract, the work\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 -2-</span>\n\n\n\n\nallotted to the petitioner on 26.04.2014 was to be completed within eighteen\n\nmonths.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">04.   According to the petitioner, after the award of the contract, the foundation\n\nstone laying ceremony of the bridge was held on 03.03.2014 on which date the\n\nthen Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare had laid the foundation on\n\nwhich occasion, a public announcement was made for converting the single lane\n\nbridge to a double lane-bridge. It is the case of the petitioner that after such a\n\npublic announcement, the authorities acted upon the public announcement and a\n\nrevised Detailed Project Report (DPR)was prepared and administrative approval\n\nwas accorded by the concerned authority, i.e., the Development Commissioner,\n\nWorks vide his letter No. PW/DCW/1552/15 dated 20.03.2015.Accordingly, the\n\nwork was revisedatthe estimated cost of ₹ 752.00 Lacsas per the relevant Code\n\nof IRC/BIS/MORD/MORTH Manual/specifications.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">05.   It has been submitted that at the time of according administrative approval\n\nto the aforesaid revised project of double land bridge,the following conditions\n\nwere specified:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;1.

That there is no Cost overrun or Time overrun involved in\n      the Project.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">06.   According to the petitioner, in terms of the revised DPR, the petitioner\n\nconstructed the DoubleLane Concrete Bridgeas per the drawing approved by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 -3-</span>\n\n\n\n\nDepartment, and on completion of the bridge in the year 2015, it was handed\n\nover to the Department. It has been submitted that no dispute had been raised by\n\nthe authorities as regards the quality of the work or any other aspect.However,\n\nwhen the petitioner raised the bills for payment for the works executed, the\n\nauthorities released only ₹ 238.00 Lacs and subsequently, ₹ 60,000/- were paid.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, though certain amounts have been paid to him, an\n\namount of ₹ 312.00 lacs remains unpaid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"161512851\" id=\"span_3\">07.   As the said amount was not paid despite repeated requests made by the\n\npetitioner, he was compelled to approach this Court by filling a writ petition,\n\nbeing OWP No. 1360/2017, „M/s <a href=\"/doc/161512851/\" id=\"a_2\">A K Engineers versus State of J&amp;K</a> and ors.‟\n\nwhich was disposed of by this Court on 25.08.2017 with the direction to the\n\nrespondent authorities to consider the claim of petitioner for payment of amount\n\nin question by issuing a speaking order within a period of six weeks from the\n\ndate of order. It has been submitted that inspite of said direction issued by this\n\nCourt, no payment has been made, leaving the petitioner with no option but to\n\nissue a legal notice dated 05.01.2022 for appointment of an arbitrator invoking\n\nClause 24 of the General Conditions of the Contract of Standard Bidding\n\nDocument for settlement of the disputes/claims within 45 days of the receipt of\n\nthe notice. However, as the respondents have not responded to the said legal\n\nnotice, the petitioner has approached this Court invoking <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\n\nAct for appointment of an arbitrator.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">08.   The present petition has been contested by the respondents primarily on\n\ntwo grounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      Firstly, it has been submitted that though there may be an initial contract\n\nor agreement executed between the petitioner and the respondents in respect of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 -4-</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe design and construction of a Single Lane 100 mts bridge in terms of the NIT\n\ndated 11.01.2015, no valid contract was executed between the parties with\n\nrespect to the works for construction of the Two Lane Bridge. Accordingly, it\n\nhas been submitted that if no valid contract was executed for the remaining work\n\nother than the one mentioned in the NIT, it cannot be said that any valid\n\nagreement exists between the petitioner and the respondents by which any\n\ndispute which arises can be settled by arbitration between the parties.\n\nAccordingly, it has been submitted that as there is no valid contract between the\n\nparties, the present application is not maintainable, and the petitioner can seek\n\nother alternate remedy available under law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">09.   Learned counsel for the respondents in asserting that no valid contract\n\nexists between the parties and, hence, there is no valid arbitration agreement, has\n\nsubmitted that mere public announcement does not amount to existence of any\n\ncontract. He submits that every contract must be executed as provided under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1084525/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 299</a> of Constitution of India and there cannot be any contract by\n\nimplication. In the present case, the petitioner is not able to show any valid\n\ncontract entered between the petitioner and authorized person of the\n\nGovernment for execution of construction of a two lane bridge. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1890075\" id=\"span_5\">In this regard\n\nlearned counsel has relied on a decision rendered in <a href=\"/doc/1890075/\" id=\"a_5\">K P Chowdhry versus State\n\nof M.P. and others</a> :AIR 1967 SC 203, in which, it has been held as follows:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       &quot;What was said in these cases with respect to<a href=\"/doc/138062738/\" id=\"a_6\"> S. 175(3)</a> of the\n       Government of India Act, 1935, applies with equal force to <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_7\">Art.\n       299 (1)</a> of the Constitution. Two consequences follow from these\n       decisions. The first is that in view of <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_8\">Art. 299(1)</a> there can be no\n       implied contract between the Government and another person,\n       the reason being that if such implied contracts between the\n       Government and another person were allowed, they would in\n       effect make <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_9\">Art. 299(1)</a> useless, for then a person who had a\n       contract with Government which was not executed at all in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 -5-</span>\n\n\n\n\n       manner provided in <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_10\">Art. 299(1)</a> could get away by saying that an\n       implied contract may be inferred on the facts and circumstances\n       of a particular case. This is of course not to say that if there is a\n       valid contract as envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_11\">Art. 299(1)</a>, there may not be\n       implications arising out of such a contract. The second\n       consequence which follows from these decisions is that if the\n       contract between Government and another person is not in full\n       compliance with <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_12\">Art. 299(1)</a> it would be no contract at all and\n       could not be enforced either by the Government or by the other\n       person as a contract. In the present case it is not in dispute that\n       there never was a contract as required by <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_13\">Art. 299(1)</a> of the\n       Constitution. Nor can the fact that the appellant bid at the\n       auction and signed the bid-sheet at the close thereof or signed\n       the declaration necessary before he could bid at the auction\n       amount to a contract between him and the Government satisfying\n       all the conditions of <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_14\">Art. 299(1).</a> The position therefore is that\n       there was no contract between the appellant and the Government\n       before he bid at the auction, nor was there any contract between\n       him and the Government after the auction was over as required\n       by <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 299(1)</a> of the Constitution. Further, in view of the\n       mandatory terms of <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_16\">Art. 299(1)</a>, no implied contract could be\n       spelled out between the Government and the appellant at the\n       stage of bidding for <a href=\"/doc/1084525/\" id=\"a_17\">Art. 299</a> in effect rules out all implied\n       contracts between Government and another person. The view\n       taken by the High Court that s. 155 (b) of the Madhya Pradesh\n       Land Revenue Code which provides for recovery of money as\n       arrears of land revenue would therefore ensure in favour of the\n       Government and enable it to recover the deficiency cannot be\n       sustained. That clause provides for recovery of all moneys falling\n       due to the State Government under any grant, lease or contract\n       and says that they shall be recoverable in the same manner as\n       arrears of land revenue. The High Court was of the view that the\n       word &quot;contract&quot; in this clause includes an implied contract. But\n       if there can be no implied contract between the Government and\n       another person in view of the mandatory provision of <a href=\"/doc/1525624/\" id=\"a_18\">Art.\n       299(1)</a> of the Constitution there can be no question of recovery of\n       any money under an implied contract under clause (b) of Section\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       155. The view therefore taken by the High Court that this amount\n       could be recovered under s. 155(b) is not correct.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">10.   Learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that it has been clearly\n\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/153260/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 that\n\nassuming but not admitting that there was some contract in respect of the second\n\nwork, but since there was no contract-agreement in writing, the petitioner cannot\n\nmake any reference to the original contract which was made for the construction\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 -6-</span>\n\n\n\n\nof a Single Lane Bridge for invoking the arbitration clause. Thus, it is clearly\n\nevident that there was no arbitration clause in respect of the subsequent contract\n\nfor execution of construction of Two Lane Bridge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">11.   Learned counsel for the respondents further submits that it is the eminent\n\nduty of the reference Court to examine the existence of a valid contract before\n\nany order is passed under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 11</a> of the Act for appointment of an arbitrator,\n\nand if there is no valid contract, the question of referring the dispute to an\n\narbitrator appointed under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11</a> of the Act does not arise. In this regard\n\nlearned counsel for the respondents has placed reliance on another decision of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Magic Eye Developers Pvt. Ltd. versus M/s Green Edge\n\nInfrastructure Pvt. Ltd. &amp;Ors. : 2023 SCC OnLine SC 620, wherein, it has\n\nbeen observed in paragraph no.16 as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      &quot;At this stage, it is required to be noted that as per the settled\n      position of law, pre-referral jurisdiction of the court under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n      11(6)</a> of the Arbitration Act is very narrow and inheres two inquiries.\n      The primary inquiry is about the existence and the validity of an\n      arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry as to the\n      parties to the agreement and the applicant‟s privity to the said\n      agreement. The said matter requires a thorough examination by the\n      referral court. [paragraph 25 of the decision in the case of NTPC\n      Ltd. (supra)]. The Secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference\n      stage itself is with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n      Both are different and distinct. So far as the first issue with respect\n      to the existence and the validity of an arbitration agreement is\n      concerned, as the same goes to the root of the matter, the same has\n      to be to conclusively decided by the referral court at the referral\n      stage itself. Now, so far as the non- arbitrability of the dispute is\n      concerned, even as per the law laid-down by this Court in the case of\n      Vidya Drolia (supra), the court at pre- referral stage and while\n      examining the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act may even\n      consider prima facie examining the arbitrability of claims. As\n      observed, the prima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the\n      deadwood and trim off the side branches in straightforward cases\n      where dismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and\n      law the litigation must stop at the first stage. However, so far as the\n      dispute with respect to the existence and validity of an arbitration\n      agreement is concerned and when the same is raised at pre-referral\n      stage, the referral court has to decide the said issue conclusively and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  -7-</span>\n\n\n\n\n      finally and should not leave the said issue to be determined by the\n      arbitral tribunal. The reason is that the issue with respect to the\n      existence and validity of an arbitration agreement goes to the root of\n      the matter. As observed by the Constitution Bench in the case of N.N.\n      Global Mercantile Pvt. Ltd. (supra) Sans an agreement, there cannot\n      be any reference to the arbitration. In the said decision this Court\n      has also specifically observed and held that the intention behind the\n      insertion of <a href=\"/doc/63461877/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 11(6A)</a> in the Act was to confine the Court,\n      acting under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 11</a>, to examine and ascertain about the\n      existence of an arbitration agreement. We are of the opinion that\n      therefore, if the dispute/issue with respect to the existence and\n      validity of an arbitration agreement is not conclusively and finally\n      decided by the referral court while exercising the pre-referral\n      jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11(6)</a> and it is left to the arbitral tribunal,\n      it will be contrary to <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 11(6A)</a> of the Arbitration Act. It is the\n      duty of the referral court to decide the said issue first conclusively to\n      protect the parties from being forced to arbitrate when there does\n      not exist any arbitration agreement and/or when there is no valid\n      arbitration agreement at all.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"20317\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"20317\" id=\"span_10\">12.   Further, learned counsel for the respondents referred to the case of <a href=\"/doc/20317/\" id=\"a_28\">„M.R\n\nEngineers &amp; Contracts Pvt. Ltd. versus Som Datt Builders Ltd.</a>: (2009) 7 SCC\n\n696, wherein it has been held that there is nothing to indicate that the subsequent\n\nwork, in absence of any written agreement or contract, can be said to be part of\n\nthe main contract and any such sub-contract or subsequent contract must be\n\ndirectly relatable to the main contract and must form integral part of the initial\n\ncontract otherwise, it would not be permissible to act on it. In paragraph no. 32\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/20317/\" id=\"a_29\">Som Datt</a> (supra) it has been held as follows.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;32. The work order (sub-contract), relevant portions of which\n      have been extracted in para 3 above, shows that the intention of\n      the parties was not to incorporate the main contract (between the\n      PW Department and respondent) in entirety into the sub contract.\n      The use of the words &quot;This sub-contract shall be carried out on\n      the terms and conditions as applicable to main contract&quot; in the\n      work order would indicate an intention that only the terms and\n      conditions in the main contract relating to execution of the work,\n      were adopted as a part of the sub-contract between respondent\n      and appellant, and not the parts of the main contract which did\n      not relate to execution of the work, as for example the terms\n      relating to payment of security deposit, mobilization advance, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   -8-</span>\n\n\n\n\n      itemised rates for work done, payment, penalties for breach etc.,\n      or the provision for dispute resolution by arbitration&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">13.   Thus the plea of respondents is that there was no contract as far as the\n\nconstruction of the two lane bridge is concerned, which was based merely on a\n\npublic announcement. Accordingly, as there was no contract, consequently,\n\nthere cannot be any arbitration clause, and hence, the question of referring the\n\nmatter to an arbitrator does not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">14.   On the other hand, learned Senior counsel for the petitioner submits that it\n\nis not a case where the petitioner had executed the work merely on the basis of\n\npublic announcement at the time of foundation stone lying ceremony by the then\n\nMinister as contended by the respondents. In fact, after the public announcement\n\nwas made, the administrative actions were taken to revise the DPR and,\n\naccordingly, design was approved for construction of a two lane bridge and\n\nwork was executed based on the revised DPR and the work was completed to\n\nthe satisfaction of the authorities as can be seen from the letter dated 26.02.2015\n\nwritten by the Chief Engineer to Commissioner /Secretary to Government,\n\nPW(R&amp;B) Department, Jammu, to the effect that the construction of 100 mts\n\nlong bridge over Aik Nallah at Rehal was executed under NABARD Loan\n\nAssistance (District Sector RIDF-XVIII) at an estimated cost of ₹ 329.60 Lacs\n\nand same was allotted to the petitioner.It was also mentioned that at the time of\n\nlaying of foundation stone ceremony of the bridge, the then Hon‟ble Union\n\nMinister for health had directed the Chief Engineer to convert the single lane\n\nbridge to double lane specification and, accordingly, the revised AAA was\n\nprepared at the cost of ₹ 752.80 Lacs and the approval stood accorded.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">      It was also mentioned in the said letter that the sub-structure and the 1st\n\nspan of the bridge was completed and the 2nd span was in progress.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  -9-</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">        Accordingly, on completion of the bridge, a request was made by the\n\nChief Engineer to the Commissioner/Secretary PW(R&amp;B) Department, Jammu,\n\nto release the additional amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">15.     It has been further submitted by the Ld. Senior Counsel for the petitioner\n\nthat it is not a simple case of construction of a bridge after public announcement\n\nwas made by an Hon‟ble Member, but such an announcement was followed by\n\nadministrative actions by way of approving the revised DPR etc. which is\n\nclearly evident from the various communications referred to hereinabove and as\n\nalso mentioned in the writ petition. It has been contended that as per the <a href=\"/doc/1616495/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n\n7(4)(b)</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 the exchange of\n\ncommunication clearly proves the existence of an agreement in writing and, as\n\nsuch, the respondents cannot invoke <a href=\"/doc/1084525/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 299</a> of the Constitution to claim that\n\nno contract exists between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">16.     Mr. Gupta, Ld. Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that there are\n\nsufficient material evidences on record to show the existence of an agreement\n\nbetween the parties and, as such, it cannot be said that there was no contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">17.     On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submits that even\n\nif it is assumed that existence of contract can be said to have been established by\n\nthese correspondences, yet it does not indicate that these correspondences have a\n\ndirect reference to the terms of the initial agreement containing arbitration\n\nclause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">18.     Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner on the other hand seeks to\n\nrepudiate the said contention by submitting that the subsequent work is an\n\nextension of the original work, and in essence, these works are one and the\n\nsame.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                   -10-</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"197048\" id=\"span_14\">19.   Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner relies on a decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/197048/\" id=\"a_32\">State of West Bengal versus B.K.Mondal and Sons</a>. 1962\n\nAIR (SC) 779, in which it has been held that even if it is assumed that no\n\nadditional contract exists, yet the respondents cannot take advantage now for\n\nalleged non-existence of contract for the reason that they have already\n\nacknowledged the completion of work with their consent and approval.Thus, in\n\nview of <a href=\"/doc/1454268/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 70</a> of the Contract Act, the respondents cannot escape the\n\nliability, inasmuch, as the petitioner was not executing the work pro bono.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">      Accordingly, it has been submitted that it does not behove of the State\n\nauthorities to raise this plea after having the work executed by the petitioner\n\nwithout raising any dispute as regard the quality of the work.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">20.   Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and having perused the\n\nmaterials on records, it is evident that the main thrust of the contention of the\n\nrespondents is that there is no valid contract between the parties containing an\n\narbitration clause, which would enable the parties to resolve the dispute between\n\nthe parties by way of arbitration, in which event, appointment of an arbitrator\n\ndoes not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">21.   There is no doubt that the NIT related to construction of a single lane\n\nbridge. There is also no dispute that there is a contract which contains an\n\narbitration clause as regards the said construction of single lane bridge.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">22.   But subsequently, the said single lane bridge was converted to a double\n\nlane bridge at the instance of the authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">      The petitioner himself did not convert the single lane bridge to a double\n\nlane bridge and the same was done with the full knowledge, urging of the\n\nauthorities and the authorities had accepted the completed double lane bridge.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 -11-</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">      In other words, as far as the petitioner is concerned, he was made to\n\nconstruct a double lane bridge in lieu of the single lane bridge at the instance of\n\nthe respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">23.   The subsequent enhanced work for construction of the double lane bridge\n\nthough appears to be a different work was not envisaged under the original\n\ntender and the resultant contract, yet if this Court examines the matter minutely\n\nit appears that the subsequent work cannot be separated from the initial work\n\nallotted. It is evident from the facts and circumstances that the double lane\n\nbridge was a continuation or extension of the work of the initial single lane\n\nbridge awarded to the contractor. Otherwise also, from the acts of the\n\nrespondents, as can be seen from the correspondences, it is clearly evident that\n\nthe respondents sought to convert the single lane bridge into a double lane\n\nbridge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">24.   If there is an additional work which is an integral part of the original\n\ncontract which cannot be segregated, such a work has to be deemed to be part of\n\nthat original contract and any dispute arising out of such integrated work would\n\nbe amenable to arbitration if the original work agreement contains an arbitration\n\nclause. In my opinion, the double lane bridge which was constructed by the\n\npetitioner can be considered to be an integral part of the initial contract. The\n\ndouble lane bridge was not a separate work allotted to the petitioner or executed\n\nafter the completion of the single lane bridge. In fact, once the said work of\n\ndouble lane bridge was approved by the respondent authorities, from the very\n\nbeginning of the work, the work of the single lane bridge of which there is a\n\ncontract and an arbitration clause gets mixed with the work of the double lane\n\nbridge and thus, by implication, the contract for the single lane bridge gets\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                  -12-</span>\n\n\n\n\nconverted to double lane bridge and any dispute pertaining to any component of\n\nthe original work of the single lane bridge cannot be separated and any other\n\ninterpretation would be greatly prejudicial to the petitioner, and not yet\n\ndetrimental to the interest of the respondents, in as much as it was only because\n\nof the urging and approval of the respondents that the petitioner executed the\n\ndouble lane bridge in lieu of a single lane bridge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_17\">25.   It may be also noted that it was held in <a href=\"/doc/121987320/\" id=\"a_34\">Vidya Drolia v. Durga Trading\n\nCorpn.</a>: (2021) 2 SCC 1 that the primary duty of the Court in an application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 11</a> is to give a prima facie opinion on the existence of a valid\n\nagreement and of arbitrable disputes and it is only when the Court is certain that\n\nno arbitration agreement exists with regard to the subject matter, reference to the\n\narbitrator may be refused. However, it has also been emphasized by the Hon‟ble\n\nSupreme Court that when there is the slightest doubt about this issue, the rule is\n\nto refer the dispute to the arbitrator and the issue shall be decided by the\n\narbitrator, &quot;when in doubt, do refer&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_18\">In this regard, it may be apposite to refer to\n\nsome of relevant paragraphs in the judgment of <a href=\"/doc/121987320/\" id=\"a_36\">Vidya Drolia</a> (supra) as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      &quot;133. Prima facie case in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 8</a> is not to be\n      confused with the merits of the case put up by the parties which\n      has to be established before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is restricted\n      to the subject-matter of the suit being prima facie arbitrable under\n      a valid arbitration agreement. Prima facie case means that the\n      assertions on these aspects are bona fide. When read with the\n      principles of separation and competence-competence and <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n      34</a> of the Arbitration Act, the referral court without getting bogged\n      down would compel the parties to abide unless there are good and\n      substantial reasons to the contrary.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"633209\" id=\"span_19\">134. Prima facie examination is not full review but a primary first\n      review to weed out manifestly and ex facie non-existent and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                           -13-</span>\n\n\n\n\ninvalid arbitration agreements and non-arbitrable disputes. The\nprima facie review at the reference stage is to cut the deadwood\nand trim off the side branches in straightforward cases where\ndismissal is barefaced and pellucid and when on the facts and law\nthe litigation must stop at the first stage. Only when the court is\ncertain that no valid arbitration agreement exists or the\ndisputes/subject-matter are not arbitrable, the application under\n<a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 8</a> would be rejected. At this stage, the court should not get\nlost in thickets and decide debatable questions of facts. Referral\nproceedings are preliminary and summary and not a mini trial.\nThis necessarily reflects on the nature of the jurisdiction exercised\nby the court and in this context, the observations of B.N.\nSrikrishna, J. of &quot;plainly arguable&quot; case in <a href=\"/doc/633209/\" id=\"a_40\">Shin-Etsu Chemical\nCo. Ltd. [Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v.

Jayesh Dinesh Shah</a>, (2016) 8 SCC 788 : (2016) 4\nSCC (Civ) 303] wherein the test applied at the pre-arbitration\nstage was whether there is a &quot;good arguable case&quot; for the\nexistence of an arbitration agreement.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">..................................................................................\n   .................................................................................\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">153. Accordingly, we hold that the expression &quot;existence of an\narbitration agreement&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act, would\ninclude aspect of validity of an arbitration agreement, albeit the\ncourt at the referral stage would apply the prima facie test on the\nbasis of principles set out in this judgment. In cases of debatable\nand disputable facts, and good reasonable arguable case, etc., the\ncourt would force the parties to abide by the arbitration\nagreement as the Arbitral Tribunal has primary jurisdiction and\nauthority to decide the disputes including the question of\njurisdiction and non-arbitrability.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">. ..........................................................................\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                 -14-</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">      .................................................................................\n      ................................................................................\n\n      154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 8</a>\n      or 11 stage when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the\n      arbitration agreement is non-existent, invalid or the disputes are\n      non-arbitrable, though the nature and facet of non-arbitrability\n      would, to some extent, determine the level and nature of judicial\n      scrutiny. The restricted and limited review is to check and protect\n      parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is\n      demonstrably &quot;non-arbitrable&quot; and to cut off the deadwood. The\n      court by default would refer the matter when contentions relating\n      to non-arbitrability are plainly arguable; when consideration in\n      summary proceedings would be insufficient and inconclusive;\n      when facts are contested; when the party opposing arbitration\n      adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration\n      proceedings. This is not the stage for the court to enter into a mini\n      trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the jurisdiction of the\n      Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity and efficacy of\n      arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.\n      ..........................................................................................\n      ........................................................................\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">      238. At the cost of repetition, we note that <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 8</a> of the Act\n      mandates that a matter should not (sic) be referred to an\n      arbitration by a court of law unless it finds that prima facie there\n      is no valid arbitration agreement. The negative language used in\n      the section is required to be taken into consideration, while\n      analysing the section. The court should refer a matter if the\n      validity of the arbitration agreement cannot be determined on a\n      prima facie basis, as laid down above. Therefore, the rule for the\n      court is &quot;when in doubt, do refer&quot;.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">26.
