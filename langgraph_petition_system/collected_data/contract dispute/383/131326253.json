The Petitioner was appointed as a contractor for the construction of\nRoad Bed, Major and Minor bridges, and Track Linking (excluding\nsupply of rails, sleepers and thick Webs Witches) S&amp;T General Electrical\nWorks in Abu Road, Sarotra Road (24.35 kms) in Ajmer Division of\nNorth Western Railway in Rajasthan and Gujarat State, India. The total\nvalue of the said contract was Rs. 70,71,91,602/-(Rupees Seventy Crores\nSeventy One Lacs Ninety One thousand Six Hundred and two only). The\nterm of the Contract was 30 months. The said Contract, in addition to\nGeneral Conditions of the Contract (&quot;GCC&quot;), was further supplemented\nby Special Conditions of Contract (&quot;SCC&quot;) and a contract agreement\ndated 19th December, 2011 was executed between the parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">3.    In terms of the agreement, the Petitioner submitted to the\nRespondent, a Performance Bank Guarantee, Mobilization Advance Bank\nGuarantee and Material Advance Guarantee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.    The Petitioner submitted running bills amounting to Rs.\n33,71,78,838 and a final bill of Rs. 5,63,72,022 to the Respondent No. 1.\nIt is the case of the Petitioner that the final bill remains outstanding till\ndate. It is the case of the Petitioner that due to various hindrances at the\n\n\n\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                                Page 2\n site, which were attributable solely to Respondent No. 1, there was a\ndelay in execution of the work under the above agreement.             It is\nsubmitted that the Respondent No. 1 acknowledged such delays and it is\nfor that reason that vide its letter dated 22nd June, 2015, Respondent No.1\ngranted the extension of Date of Completion of the contract from 6 th\nJune, 2015 to 5th June, 2016 with PVC and without levying any\nLiquidated Damages. It is submitted that though such defaults on the part\nof the Respondent No. 1 continued, the Respondent No. 1 issued a\n&quot;Notice To Correct&quot; dated 9th May, 2016 to the Petitioner under clause\n15.1 of the General Conditions of Contract (GCC); the Petitioner\nresponded to the above notice under cover of its letter dated 21 st May,\n2016 giving status of the work and calling upon the Respondent No. 1 to\nwithdraw its notice and extend the period of completion up to December,\n2016. It is submitted that without considering the above reply and in a\nmechanical manner, the Respondent issued the Notice of Termination of\nthe contract under Clause 15.2 of the GCC. The Petitioner protested\nagainst the same vide letter dated 14th June, 2016, however, later\nsubmitted the final bill, as mentioned above, on 6th August, 2016 to the\nRespondent No. 1.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.    The Petitioner, apprehending, that the Respondent would invoke\nthe bank guarantee(s) submitted by the Petitioner under the contract, filed\na petition under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n(herein after referred to as the &quot;Act&quot;) before the City Civil Court,\nHyderabad, being ARB.

The same was renumbered as\nCOP No. 13/2017 and the 11th ACJ vide its order dated 15th June, 2016,\n\n\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                              Page 3\n granted an ad interim exparte injunction restraining the Respondent No. 1\nand 2 from invoking or encashing the bank guarantees. The said petition\nwas dismissed on 14th July, 2017 for want of jurisdiction, whereafter the\nPetitioner filed the present petition before this Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.    This Court vide its order dated 24th July, 2017 passed an ad interim\norder directing the parties to maintain status quo.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"152816036\" id=\"span_1\">7.    Relying upon Clause 4.2 read with Clause 15.3 of the GCC, it is\nsubmitted that upon termination of the agreement, the engineer has to\nmake a determination of the sums due to the contractor for the work\nexecuted in accordance with the contract. Further, relying upon Clause\n2.5, it is submitted that if the employer ( Respondent No. 1) considers\nitself to be entitled to any payment under the contract, it shall have to\ngive a notice and particulars thereof to the contractor and the same would\nthereafter have to be determined by the engineer in terms of clause 3.5 of\nthe agreement. It is submitted that as the Respondent No. 1 has not\nissued any such notice of claim, it is not entitled to encash the bank\nguarantees in question. It is further submitted that the Petitioner has\nraised a substantial claim of Rs. 5, 62,72,022 in the form of the final bill\nwhich remains unpaid since 6th August, 2016, and therefore, Respondent\nNo. 1 remains adequately secured of any claim that it may have against\nthe Petitioner and cannot be allowed to invoke and encash the bank\nguarantees. Relying upon the Judgments of Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/152816036/\" id=\"a_2\">Gangotri\nEnterprises Limited v. Union of India and Others</a> (2016) 11 SCC 720, it\nis submitted that as the claim of the Respondent No. 1 is neither an\n\n\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                               Page 4\n admitted sum nor a sum which stood adjudicated by any court of law in\nany judicial proceedings, the bank guarantees for recovery of such claims\ncannot be allowed.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.    On the other hand, the counsel for the Respondent No. 1 submits\nthat bank guarantees in question are separate contracts between the\nRespondent No. 1 and the banks. These bank guarantees are unequivocal\nand unconditional in nature. The same cannot be injuncted from being\ngiven effect to, as they are independent contract and dispute in relation to\nthe main contract cannot be allowed to be raised         as an excuse for\npreventing the encashment of the same.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">9.     I have considered the submissions made by the counsel for the\nparties. It is not disputed and cannot be disputed that the bank guarantees\nare unconditional in nature. Clause 15.4 provides that after a notice of\ntermination, the employer (Respondent No. 1 herein) may encash the\nperformance guarantee and forfeit the performance security in full in case\nof termination of the contract as a whole. It may be correct that in terms\nof Clause 2.5, the Respondent No. 1 may have not raised any separate\nclaims against the Petitioner, however, the right to encash the bank\nguarantees in full, upon termination of the contract is a separate right\nvested with the Respondent No. 1 in Clause 4.2 and 15.4 of the\nagreement. The claims and counter claims between the parties would\nhave to be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the\nlaw, however, in anticipation of those disputes the encashment of the\nbank guarantees cannot be injuncted.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">OMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                               Page 5\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"> 10.

Numerous decisions of this Court rendered over\n             a span of nearly two decades have laid down and\n             reiterated the principles which the courts must apply\n             while considering the question whether to grant an\n             injunction which has the effect of restraining the\n             encashment of a bank guarantee. We do not think it\n             necessary to burden this judgment by referring to all\n             of them. Some of the more recent pronouncements on\n             this point where the earlier decisions have been\n             considered       and       reiterated     are <a href=\"/doc/325228/\" id=\"a_4\">Svenska\n             Handelsbanken v.

Sumac International Ltd.</a> [(1997) 1 SCC\n             568] The general principle which has been <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_6\">laid down\n             by</a> this Court has been summarised in the case\n             of U.P. State Sugar Corpn. [(1997) 1 SCC 568] as\n             follows: (SCC p. 574, para 12)\n\n             &quot;The law relating to invocation of such bank\n             guarantees is by now well settled. When in the course\n             of commercial dealings an unconditional bank\n             guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is\n             entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms\n             thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The\n\n\n\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                              Page 6\n              bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it\n             as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by\n             its customer. The very purpose of giving such a bank\n             guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The courts\n             should, therefore, be slow in granting an injunction\n             to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee.</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">             The courts have carved out only two exceptions. A\n             fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee\n             would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank\n             guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the\n             beneficiary seeks to take the advantage, he can be\n             restrained from doing so. The second exception\n             relates to cases where allowing the encashment of an\n             unconditional bank guarantee would result in\n             irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties\n             concerned. Since in most cases payment of money\n             under such a bank guarantee would adversely affect\n             the bank and its customer at whose instance the\n             guarantee is given, the harm or injustice\n             contemplated under this head must be of such an\n             exceptional and irretrievable nature as would\n             override the terms of the guarantee and the adverse\n             effect of such an injunction on commercial dealings\n             in the country.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">             Dealing with the question of fraud it has been held\n             that fraud has to be an established fraud.

The wholly exceptional case where an\n                   injunction may be granted is where it is proved\n                   that the bank knows that any demand for\n                   payment already made or which may\n\n\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                               Page 7\n                    thereafter be made will clearly be fraudulent.\n                   But the evidence must be clear, both as to the\n                   fact of fraud and as to the bank&#x27;s knowledge. It\n                   would certainly not normally be sufficient that\n                   this rests on the uncorroborated statement of\n                   the customer, for irreparable damage can be\n                   done to a bank&#x27;s credit in the relatively brief\n                   time which must elapse between the granting\n                   of such an injunction and an application by the\n                   bank to have it discharged.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                                              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_5\">(emphasis supplied)\n\n             The aforesaid passage was approved and followed by\n             this Court in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_7\">U.P.

This will have to be decisively\n             established and it must be proved to the satisfaction\n             of the court that there would be no possibility\n             whatsoever of the recovery of the amount from the\n             beneficiary, by way of restitution.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">11.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_8\">Vinitec Electronics Private Ltd. v.

The next question that falls for our\n             consideration is as to whether the present case\n             falls under any of or both the exceptions, namely,\n             whether there is a clear fraud of which the Bank\n             has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from\n             which it seeks to benefit and another exception\n             whether there are any &quot;special equities&quot; in favour\n             of granting injunction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             25. This Court in more than one decision took the\n             view that fraud, if any, must be of an egregious\n             nature as to vitiate the underlying transaction. We\n             have meticulously examined the pleadings in the\n             present case in which no factual foundation is laid\n             in support of the allegation of fraud. There is not\n             even a proper allegation of any fraud as such and\n             in fact the whole case of the appellant centres\n             around the allegation with regard to the alleged\n             breach of contract by the respondent. The plea of\n             fraud in the appellant&#x27;s own words is to the\n             following effect:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">             &quot;That despite the respondent HCL being in default\n             of not making payment as stipulated in the bank\n             guarantee, in perpetration of abject dishonesty and\n             fraud, the respondent HCL fraudulently invoked\n             the bank guarantee furnished by the applicant and\n             sought remittance of the sums under the\n             conditional bank guarantee from Oriental Bank of\n             Commerce vide letter of invocation dated 16-12-\n             2003.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">OMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                             Page 9\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              26. In our considered opinion such vague and\n             indefinite allegations made do not satisfy the\n             requirement in law constituting any fraud much\n             less the fraud of an egregious nature as to vitiate\n             the entire transaction. The case, therefore does not\n             fall within the first exception.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             27. Whether encashment of the bank guarantee\n             would cause any &quot;irretrievable injury&quot; or\n             &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot;. There is no plea of any\n             &quot;special equities&quot; by the appellant in its favour.\n             So far as the plea of &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot; is\n             concerned the appellant in its petition merely\n             stated:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             &quot;That should the respondent be successful in\n             implementing its evil design, the same would not\n             only amount to fraud, cause irretrievable injustice\n             to the applicant, and render the arbitration\n             nugatory and infructuous but would permit the\n             respondent to take an unfair advantage of their\n             own wrong at the cost and extreme prejudice of the\n             applicant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">             28.

Unfortunately, the High Court went wrong both in its\n      analysis of facts and approach on law. A cursory reading of\n      LoI would clearly show that it is not a case of forfeiture of\n      security deposit &quot;... if the contract had frustrated on\n      account of impossibility...&quot; but invocation of the\n      performance bank guarantee. On law, the High Court\n      ought to have noticed that the bank guarantee is an\n      independent contract between the guarantor Bank and the\n      guarantee appellant. The guarantee is unconditional. No\n      doubt, the performance guarantee is against the breach by\n      the lead promoter viz. the first respondent. But between the\n      bank and the appellant, the specific condition incorporated\n      in the bank guarantee is that the decision of the appellant\n      as to the breach is binding on the Bank. The justifiability of\n      the decision is a different matter between the appellant and\n      the first respondent and it is not for the High Court in a\n      proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to\n      go into that question since several disputed questions of\n      fact are involved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      11. It is contended on behalf of the first respondent that the\n      invocation of bank guarantee depends on the cancellation\n      of the contract and once the cancellation of the contract is\n      not justified, the invocation of bank guarantee also is not\n      justified. We are afraid that the contention cannot be\n      appreciated. The bank guarantee is a separate contract and\n      is not qualified by the contract on performance of the\n      obligations. No doubt, in terms of the bank guarantee also,\n      the invocation is only against a breach of the conditions in\n      the LoI. But between the appellant and the Bank, it has\n\n\n\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 271/2017                                                Page 11\n       been stipulated that the decision of the appellant as to the\n      breach shall be absolute and binding on the Bank.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      12. An injunction against the invocation of an absolute and\n      an unconditional bank guarantee cannot be granted except\n      in situations of egregious fraud or irretrievable injury to\n      one of the parties concerned.
