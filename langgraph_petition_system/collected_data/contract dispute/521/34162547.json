In the present Appeal, the appellant challenges the order dated\n10th October, 2011, passed by the Arbitral Tribunal, wherein the\nlearned sole Arbitrator has allowed an application moved by the\nrespondent under Section 16(1), (2) and (3) of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_1\">Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;).      The\nimpugned order terminates the arbitration proceedings. It is held in\nthe impugned order that the claim submitted by the appellant before\nthe tribunal cannot be entertained.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.     Brief facts are that appellant had been supplying the\nrespondent with PIJF underground cables for some time and has\nbeen a successful bidder in several earlier tenders. The contract\nbetween the parties was for supply of PIJF underground cables, on a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                        Page 1 of 30</span>\n long-term recurrent basis. There was a clause in the contract which\nentitled the respondent, BSNL to come out with circulars indicating\nthe price of copper, one of the basic raw materials used for\nmanufacture and supply of PIJF cables. Based on the said circulars,\nit was envisaged that the price payable to the appellant for supply of\nthe cables could change from time to time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.     On 12th January, 2005, the respondent floated a tender\nbearing No.MM/SW/012005/000283 (&quot;Tender Document&quot;) for the\nprocurement of 120 LCKM PIJF underground cables.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4.     The cable supplying companies declined to accept the price\noffered in the APO including the appellant. Therefore, a Price\nNegotiation Committee (PNC) was constituted by the respondent-\nBSNL on 30th June, 2005 to negotiate with the bidders referred in\nAPO. This PNC negotiated with respect to all other raw material\nprices except copper, which was to be the exclusive right of the\nrespondent to issue monthly price bulletin/circular. During this course,\nthe Union Budget in February, 2005 reduced import duty from 15% to\nZero percent on copper for Telecom Sector.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.     Further, the respondent issued APO dated 30th July, 2005 to all\nsuccessful bidders and asked for unconditional and unequivocal\nacceptance to the same, to which the appellant complied on 9th\nAugust, 2005.       As well the appellant on 30th June, 2006 and 8th\nFebruary, 2006 gave unconditional and unequivocal acceptance to all\nterms and conditions of APO and the appellant was fully aware that\nthe respondent would be issuing provisional pricing of copper and the\nfinal prices of copper were under the consideration of appropriate\ncommittee of the respondent.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                         Page 2 of 30</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\"> 6.     For the first few months of the Contract, the respondent issued\ncirculars indicating the price of copper as per the market rate\nindicated in HCL&#x27;s circulars. HCL being a manufacturer of copper\nhad the expertise to indicate the price for the same and in fact, all\nthroughout, BSNL in past tenders has adopted the price given by\nHCL. The appellant having participated in earlier tenders was aware\nof and expected this practice to continue, which it did, but only for the\nfirst few months of the present tender.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.     It is the case of the appellant that the respondent-BSNL\nsuddenly and arbitrarily started coming out with &quot;Provisional\nCirculars&quot; which indicated the rate of copper at a flat 10% lesser\nvalue than the rate indicated by HCL. At first, the appellant was\nmade to understand that there would be some form of rationalization\nand reconciliation of these rates and thus continued supplying.\nHowever, inspite of repeated requests no such reconciliation took\nplace and the respondent stuck to its arbitrary stance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">8.     The appellant was thus left with no option but to initiate\narbitration by submitting the claim for recovery of the loss suffered by\nit on account of the arbitrary act of the respondent by challenging the\nmode of computation of the prices and determination thereof by the\nrespondent in the form of circular.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">9.     The Arbitration clause as contained in the agreement reads as\nfollows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;Clause 20.

The respondent&#x27;s application under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 16</a> of the Act was\nbased on the ground that the dispute submitted by the appellant was\nnot arbitrable as the authority of BSNL to issue circulars indicating the\nprice of copper was specifically provided in the agreement and thus\nfell in the exception clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">11.    The learned arbitrator after hearing the parties passed the\nimpugned order dated 10th October, 2011 whereby the learned\narbitrator allowed the application under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 16</a> of the Act filed by\nthe respondent and terminated the arbitration proceedings. Hence,\nthe appellant has challenged the impugned order dated 10th October,\n2011 in the present appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">12.    This appeal came up for hearing when Mr.Neeraj Kishan Kaul,\nlearned Senior counsel, with Mr.Kirat Singh Nagra, Advocate\nappeared on behalf of the appellant and Mr.Ankur Mittal, Advocate\nwith Mr.Abhay Gupta, Advocate appeared on behalf of the\nrespondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">13.    Mr.Kaul, learned Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellant has made his submissions which can be outlined in the\nfollowing manner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">a)    It has been argued that the learned sole Arbitrator fell in grave\n      error by deciding the controversy on merits while dealing with the\n      objection of respondent that the dispute submitted by the\n      appellant was not arbitrable under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 16</a> of the Act. It has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Arb. A.

On the contrary, the learned Arbitrator in his\n     order dated 10th October, 2011 observed that the respondent did\n     its best to ascertain the prices of the copper on the basis of the\n     past practice and thereafter provided the circular at the current\n     rates. As per Mr.Kaul, the said decision is on the merits of the\n     case and not on the question of the arbitrability of the dispute.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">     Thus, the learned sole Arbitrator has erroneously decided the\n     application under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 16</a> of the Act filed by the respondents\n     and also wrongfully terminated the arbitral proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">b)   In answer to the objection under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 16</a> of the Act, Mr.Kaul\n     argued that the dispute submitted before the arbitral tribunal is\n     clearly arbitrable under clause 20 of the agreement due to the\n     numerous reasons which are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       ï‚· The appellant&#x27;s stand that the decision of the BSNL to\n           determine the copper prices is not specifically provided in\n           the agreement and thus it cannot be categorized a decision\n           under the agreement which can go outside the purview of\n           the dispute under the agreement.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       ï‚· The appellant is not challenging the competence of BSNL to\n           issue the circular but is challenging the mode of computation\n           of the prices as the said prices are ascertained in the\n           arbitrary manner by the respondent.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Arb.

Mr.Kaul relied on the judgment passed in the cases of\n     <a href=\"/doc/189357032/\" id=\"a_8\">Asian Techs Limited vs. Union of India</a>, (2009) 10 SCC 354\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Arb.

Ltd.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">     vs. State of Jharkhand, (2009) 16 SCC 705 wherein the\n     Supreme Court has held that the excepted clauses of similar\n     nature merely bar the government from entertaining the claims\n     and not the Arbitrator. Thus, this Court should also observe that\n     the claims so raised before the Arbitrator are arbitrable in nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">d)   It has been argued by Mr.Kaul, learned Senior counsel that the\n     mere fact that BSNL has issued circular under the contract, that\n     does not imply, the said circular becomes final in all terms and\n     the appellant can question the manner of the determination of\n     the price by the respondent in the copper circulars and said\n     question is nowhere mentioned to be final in the agreement. It is\n     submitted that the power to issue circular does not entitle the\n     respondent to determine copper prices at the rates which are\n     arbitrary without considering the relevant factors or the market\n     price.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">               It has been argued that the finality to the decision of the\n     respondent in the present form as done by the learned sole\n     Arbitrator when the agreement does not provide such finality in\n     express terms would be justifying the arbitrary action without\n     giving the appellant any right to dispute the said actions of the\n     respondent at any forum. Thus, the respondent&#x27;s stand and the\n     learned Arbitrators order holding the dispute to be non arbitrable\n     is completely unreasonable and against the public policy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">e)   It is contended by Mr.Kaul that the similar challenges to the\n     unreasonable price fixation of the copper by the respondent are\n     filed at the behest of other successful bidders are pending\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Arb.

Similar case of the present\n      nature is Vindhya Telelinks Ltd vs. Chairman Cum Managing\n      Director BSNL pending before another Arbitrator who is the\n      retired judge of this Court. The respondent has also not filed the\n      application under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 16</a> of the Act in the said case and as\n      such the same should weigh before the Court to hold that the\n      dispute submitted before the Arbitrator is arbitrable in nature and\n      the objection under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 16</a> of the Act should be overruled.\n       In view of the aforementioned submissions advanced by the\nlearned Senior counsel for the appellant, it has been prayed that this\nCourt should allow the appeal by setting aside the order dated 10th\nOctober, 2011 and proceed to hold that the claim submitted by the\nappellant before the learned Arbitrator are arbitrable in view of the\nclause 20 of the agreement dated 30th July, 2005.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">14.    Per contra Mr.Ankur Mittal, learned counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the respondent has made his submissions which can be\noutlined in the following manner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">a)    It has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondent as\n      well as mentioned in the written submission that the appellants\n      have wrongly stated that the learned Arbitrator has returned the\n      finding in the impugned order that the matter falls within the\n      excepted matter and there cannot be any arbitration. Such\n      finding cannot be read or made out from the reading of the\n      impugned order. The argument of the appellant proceeds on\n      erroneous basis which has no foundation in the impugned order.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">b)    It has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondent\n      that the learned Arbitrator has only given the finding that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Arb.

I shall now\nproceed to discuss various aspects which fall for consideration in the\npresent case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">16.    Firstly, it is noteworthy to mention that the order dated 10th\nOctober, 2011 passed by the learned Arbitrator was a decision on the\napplication filed by the respondent under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 16</a> of Act. The said\norder as per the respondent&#x27;s counsel own saying does not hold that\nthe Arbitrator has no jurisdiction to entertain the claim submitted\nbefore him but proceeds to observe that as the respondent had made\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                           Page 13 of 30</span>\n the fair attempt to determine the copper prices and then provided for\nthe prices in the circular, the Arbitrator has further held that he cannot\ngo outside the purview of the agreement, which as per the learned\ncounsel for the respondent is well within the domain of the Arbitrator\nas the Arbitrator cannot act in excess of the authority.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">17.    Perusal of the order dated 10th October, 2011 would show that\nthe learned Arbitrator proceeds to justify the determination of the\nprices by the respondent by issuance of the circular on various\ngrounds and proceeds to hold that the Arbitrator cannot entertain\nsuch claim submitted before him. The said order dated 10th October,\n2011 passed by the Arbitrator does not test the arbitrability of the\ndispute submitted before the Arbitrator on the basis of the authority of\nthe Arbitrator emanating from the agreement or as a matter of law to\nrule on the dispute submitted before him nor the order arrives at the\nconclusive finding as to by operation of which clause under the\nagreement, the dispute cannot be submitted before the Arbitrator and\nconsequently affects his authority to hear the matter. The Arbitrator\nthough frames the issue on the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to hear\nthe matter but does not answer the same by placing reliance upon\nthe clauses of the agreement dated 30th July, 2005 or giving any\nother justifiable cause either on facts or in law which bars him from\nentertaining the claim submitted before him except by deciding the\ndispute on merits by referring the stand of the respondent as fair\nattempt to determine the prices and hence he cannot go outside the\nagreement. I find that such an approach by the arbitrator is non\nspeaking order as it does not accord any reasoning for non\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                           Page 14 of 30</span>\n arbitrability of the claim prior to adverting on merits or tenability of the\nclaim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">18.    It is clear from the plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 16</a> of the Act that the\narbitral jurisdiction is competent to rule on its jurisdiction. Once, the\nparty raises the plea of lack of jurisdiction or non arbitrability of the\ndispute submitted before the arbitrator and the arbitrator entertains\nsuch plea, then the arbitrator must decide the said plea on the issue\nrelating to arbitrability or non arbitrability prior to deciding merits of\nthe said claim. This can be seen from reading of <a href=\"/doc/1711161/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 16 (5)</a> of the\nAct wherein it is statutory mandate upon the arbitral tribunal to decide\nthe said plea as referred to in sub section (2) and subsection (3).\nSubsection (5) of <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 16</a> consciously uses the wordings &quot;the\narbitral tribunal shall decide on a plea&quot; where &quot;shall&quot; denotes the\nmandate and statutory command to rule on the pleas raised before\nthe arbitral tribunal. The arbitrator cannot avoid deciding the issue or\nplea of arbitrability by giving it a different colour or deciding some\naspect which he would decide subsequent to deciding the issue of\narbitrability. The said decision not deciding arbitrability but upholding\nthe plea without reasons would in that sense be a non speaking order\nand would be against the mandate given by the statute as per the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1711161/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 16 (5)</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">19.    The legal principle that the arbitrator is bound to rule on the\nlegal issue submitted before him prior to adverting to merits is no\nlonger res integra and the said principle was same and analogous\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_27\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> with only difference being in the\npresent Act of 1996 that mandates as a matter of law for arbitral\ntribunal to decide the said question as against the earlier Act wherein\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                             Page 15 of 30</span>\n the court may refer the said question to the arbitrator to decide. In the\ncase of Tamil Nadu Electricity board vs.                 Bridge Tunnel\nConstruction, (1997) 4 SCC 121, the Supreme Court was concerned\nwith the similar question and the court has held that the arbitrator\ncannot arrive into the merits of the controversy prior to the deciding\nthe question of the arbitrability submitted before him and the same\namounts to jurisdictional error and error apparent on the face of the\nrecord. In the words of the Supreme Court, it was observed thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     &quot;13. In the light of the above facts, the question arises;\n     whether the arbitrator was not obliged to decide the\n     non- arbitrability of some of the items claimed by the\n     respondents before/while giving a non-speaking award\n     and whether a deemed decision could be given\n     credence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243245\" id=\"span_28\">In <a href=\"/doc/1243245/\" id=\"a_28\">Tarapore Co.</a>&#x27;s case relied on by Shri Poti, a\n     Bench of two judges of this court had gone into the\n     question of jurisdiction of the arbitrator to decide the\n     arbitrability of the dispute. In para 10 thereof, it is stated\n     thus : &quot;What is the effect of referring the specific question\n     of law to arbitration without prejudice to one&#x27;s right to\n     contend to the contrary will be presently examined.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     &quot;If this issue specifically raises a question as to jurisdiction\n     of the arbitrator to arbitrate upon the dispute set out in\n     Point No.2, it appears to have been specifically referred to\n     the arbitrator for his decision. Parties, therefore, agreed to\n     submit the specific question even with regard to the scope\n     ambit width and the construction of the arbitration clause\n     so as to define its parameters and contours with a view to\n     ascertaining whether the claim advanced by the appellant\n     and disputed by the respondent would be covered by the\n     arbitration clause. Whether upon its true construction the\n     arbitration clause would include within its compass the\n     dispute thus raised between the parties was specifically put\n     in issue because parties were at variance about it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                            Page 16 of 30</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      &quot;The arbitrator was thus required and called upon first\n     to decide whether the dispute is arbitrable as falling\n     within the width and answer is in the affirmative, then\n     alone the second point need be examined. If the answer\n     to the first point of reference is in the negative in that if the\n     arbitrator were of he opinion that the dispute is not\n     arbitrable as it would not fall within the scope, width an\n     ambit of the arbitration agreement, it would not be\n     necessary for him to determine whether the appellant\n     was entitled to recover anything by way of\n     compensation. This aspect is being analysed in depth to\n     point out that the parties specifically referred the question\n     of construction of arbitration agreement, its width, ambit\n     and parameters vis-a-vis the dispute raised so as to decide\n     whether the dispute would fall within the purview of the\n     arbitration agreement, in other words the jurisdiction of the\n     arbitrator.&quot;                            (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n     Thus, it could be seen that therein that when the question\n     is specifically referred to the arbitrator, the arbitrator is\n     required to decide the question referred to him and\n     decide the point on the question. Then only he gets the\n     jurisdiction to go into the merits. In para 12 of the\n     judgment that point was elaborated holding that : &quot;The first\n     point extracted hereinbefore would clearly show that the\n     specific question about the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to\n     arbitrate upon the dispute set out in Point Nos. 2, 3 and 4\n     was          specifically       referred        to        the\n     arbitrator.                           (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n     On the first point, the arbitrator had to decide whether the\n     claims made by the appellant and disputed by the\n     respondent would be covered by clause 40, i.e. the\n     arbitration clause. In other words, the specific question\n     referred to the arbitrator was about his jurisdiction to\n     arbitrate upon the disputes covered by Points Nos. 2, 3 and\n     4, if and only if, upon a true construction of the arbitration\n     clause that is first paragraph of clause 40, would cover the\n     disputed claim for compensation he can enter into the\n     merits of the dispute and decide it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                             Page 17 of 30</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       This ratio clearly establishes that the arbitrator gets\n      jurisdiction to decide the dispute on merits only when\n      he is specifically called upon to decide the dispute in\n      terms of the contract.&quot;           (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">20.    From the reading of the aforementioned observations of the\nSupreme Court in Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (supra), it can be\nsaid that the arbitral tribunals decision on merits prior to decision on\nthe arbitrability is an error apparent on the face of the record and of\nthe jurisdictional nature warranting interference of the court. After\ndeciding the point on the arbitrability by a speaking award giving\nreasons, the arbitrator gets the jurisdiction to advert on the merits of\nthe controversy and as such applying the ratio of Tamil Nadu\nElectricity (supra) to the facts of the present case, it is can safely\nsaid that the decision of the Arbitrator in the form of impugned order\nis a non speaking award and the decision on merits with some\nreference that the arbitral tribunal cannot travel beyond the\nagreement without given cogent reasons as to preclusion of the\nauthority for the arbitrator to decide the merits of the claim submitted\nbefore him cannot be considered as deemed decision on arbitrability\nand warrants interference of this court in appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">21.    On facts, I also find that the decision on the merits that the\nprices determined by the respondent due to their prior efforts and by\neventually issuing the circular is not the decision affecting the\narbitrability of the dispute submitted before the Arbitrator and rather\nthe said finding of the learned Arbitrator is contradictory to the latter\npart of the observations wherein the learned Arbitrator holds that the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                          Page 18 of 30</span>\n Arbitrator cannot go beyond the written agreement and thus dispute\ncannot be entertained. The decision on merits of the controversy or\nclaim by preference of one set of facts presented by the party as\nagainst the other itself implies that the Arbitrator can rule over the\nclaim submitted before him. Otherwise, the Arbitrator had no\noccasion to advert to the merits of the claim and had to simply test\nthe arbitrability of the claim. This is clear contradiction to ruling on\narbitrability which goes into the root of the matter and takes away the\nauthority of the arbitrator to decide even on merits of the claim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">22.    If the learned Arbitrator were to determine the fairness of the\nmethod of computation of the prices done by the respondent, then the\nevaluation of the stand of both the parties was essential. In that\nrespect, the order dated 10th October, 2011 is procedurally irregular\nand the said observations of the learned Arbitrator cannot be passed\nin the application under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 16</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">23.    I also do not agree with the submission advanced by the\nlearned counsel for the respondent that the impugned order passed\nby the learned arbitrator should be considered as decision on the\nplea of <a href=\"/doc/250006/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 16 (3)</a> wherein the arbitrator can decide whether he is\nexceeding his authority or not at any stage of the proceedings. My\nreasons of variance with the submission advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent are as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">   ï‚· The said question of excess of authority or exceeding the\n       jurisdiction by the arbitrator has to be decided by the arbitrator\n       by referring to the clauses of the agreement and inextricably\n       connected with the answer to the question whether the dispute\n       as such referred before the arbitrator is covered by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Arb.

The\n       learned arbitrator while passing the impugned order does not\n       delve into these inquiries at all on facts and just quotes the\n       decision of Supreme Court that he cannot travel beyond the\n       agreement and the same amounts to misconduct. Such a\n       decision is non speaking award not only for the purposes of\n       <a href=\"/doc/1746186/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 16 (2)</a> as observed above but also for the purposes of\n       the decision on the plea under <a href=\"/doc/250006/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 16 (3)</a> of the Act of\n       1996.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">   ï‚· As the learned arbitrator has not arrived at any conclusive\n       finding as to how he is exceeding his authority, then as per\n       dictum of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (supra), no deemed\n       inference as to decision making on the point of the arbitrability\n       or excess of jurisdiction can be drawn.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">In such a case, it is not possible to accept the submission advanced\nby the learned counsel for the respondent that the decision of the\nlearned arbitrator is a deemed decision on the plea of <a href=\"/doc/250006/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 16 (3)</a>\nof the Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">24.

The explanatory note 1 gives a hint that the price\n     variation shall be calculated on the basic price element of the\n     approved rate and the shall be used to arrive at the composite\n     price to be offered to vendors.

The said schedule XI also does not give\n     any mandate that the said computation done by BSNL shall be\n     termed as decision in the agreement. If that is so provided\n     specifically in the agreement or the schedule XI which may be\n     termed as a part of the agreement, only then it can be said that\n     aspect is ousted or can be termed as excepted matter within the\n     meaning of the agreement. In cases of ambiguity where the\n     arbitration clauses is broad enough to cover each and every\n     dispute arising out of or in connection there with the agreement\n     as against the excepted matters which is confined to specific\n     mention of the decision under the agreement. No deemed\n     inference as to specificity or decision making of BSNL may be\n     drawn once it is not clearly evinced from the agreement or the\n     schedule appended thereto in the agreement.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">g)   As against the absence of any specific mention in the agreement\n     or the schedule thereto relating to the decision of BSNL under\n     the agreement, Schedule XI provides the mode of computation\n     of the prices and the guidelines for doing such computation\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Arb.

The said\n     schedule also merely provides that BSNL may issue circular in\n     this respect for working out such composite price. The schedule\n     XI also no where attaches any finality to the prices ascertained\n     by the respondent nor calls it as a decision under the agreement.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">     In such circumstances, a dispute as to mode of computation of\n     the prices when it is not specifically categorized as a decision\n     under the agreement can be raised and can conveniently fall\n     within the ambit of clause 20 of the agreement. This is also the\n     reason the respondent has failed to point out any provision in the\n     agreement during the argument and not even in the written\n     submissions as to which provision specifically provides that the\n     price circular issued by the respondent is a decision within the\n     meaning of the agreement and hence excluded matter. In the\n     absence of the said provision, dispute is clearly arbitrable in\n     nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">       In view of the position discussed above, upon fair and\nmeaningful reading of the clauses of the agreement, it can be safely\nsaid that the dispute as to the mode of computation of the prices or\neffect of variation of prices in Copper can be made in the event the\ndissatisfied contractor assails the computation carried out by BSNL in\nform issuance of the circular on the grounds permissible to him be it\nis not fair or is not as per past practice or without following the mode\nof computation as per the representation given at the earlier occasion\nby giving its justifications as to what can be the actual computations\nas per the contractors and the arbitrator can decide the same\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Arb. A. No.4/2012                                         Page 27 of 30</span>\n depending upon the merits of the claim. In such cases, as there is no\nindication as to finality attached to the circular which can be evinced\nfrom the agreement or schedule XI appended to the agreement, the\ndispute is clearly arbitrable and can be subjected to the arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">25.    I also do not agree with the submission of the learned counsel\nfor the respondent that the writ petition could be preferred if the prices\nwere found to be arbitrary in nature by the contractor prior to\naccepting the purchase order by the petitioner. This is due to the\nreason that the jurisdiction of the courts is also excluded in the\nagreement by operation of clause 30 which only permits filing of such\nwrit petition only prior to the working of the contract by curtailing the\njudicial interference. In the instant case, the appellant&#x27;s grievance is\nthat after working of the agreement, in between the respondent\nstarted issuing the circulars without considering the rates issued by\nHCL which were earlier considered in the circular and departed from\nthe past practice prejudicial to the interest of the claimant/ appellant.\nThus, the writ petition challenging the arbitrary nature of computation\nin pricing done after the commencement of the working of the\nagreement or issuance of the purchase order cannot be assailed\neven in writ petition due to the operation of clause 30 of the\nagreement. Accordingly, it is incumbent that the doors of atleast one\nforum should remain open so that the dispute as to wrong\ncomputation of the prices of copper when the copper is essential\ningredient and subject on the basis of which prices of PIJF cables are\ndetermined should be adjudicated in the form of arbitration, more so\nwhen the arbitration clause is broad enough to cover such disputes\nand there is no indication in the agreement in specific terms that it is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Arb.

The said view is also necessary as the judicial\nreview of the state actions is basic structure of Indian constitution and\nabsolute finality to the departmental actions impermissible in law as\nthe said actions cannot remain beyond judicial review absolutely. In\nview of the same, I reject the submission advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent that the writ remedy was available to the\npetitioner in alternative to the arbitration proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"189357032\" id=\"span_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"86669454\" id=\"span_43\">26.    So far as the judgments relating to the excepted matters being\nnon arbitrable as cited by the learned counsel for the respondent\nincluding the judgments of Apex court in <a href=\"/doc/86669454/\" id=\"a_36\">Tehri</a> (supra) where the view\nin <a href=\"/doc/189357032/\" id=\"a_37\">Asia Tech</a> (supra) has been doubted, the said judgments are not\napplicable and are distinguishable in view of the difference in facts of\nthe said cases with that of the present case. In the instant case, there\nis no clearly borne out from the agreement as to which of the clause\nunder the agreement calls the determination of the prices by issuance\nof the price circular by the respondent as a decision within the\nmeaning of the agreement. In such a case when the arbitration\nclause is of widest amplitude and exception is narrower, it is difficult\nto put the claim submitted before the arbitrator under the bracket of\nthe excepted matter and once my finding is that it is not the excepted\nmatter, then the judgments of the Apex Court or this court laying\ndown that the excepted matters are non arbitrable do not aid the case\nof the respondent.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">27.    The matter can also be seen from another angle which is that\nthe petitioner is not challenging the authority or competency of the\nrespondent to issue circulars containing the prices of copper so that\nthe contracts should follow the same, the respondent is attempting to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Arb.

The contract is concerning supply of\nPIJF cables and talks about the prices of the copper in clauses 9 of\nthe agreement which is an essential ingredient having its role to play\nin pricing of copper. In such circumstances, the dispute concerning\nthe computation of pricing of copper is not the one which is outside\nthe agreement but is inextricably connected with that of subject\nmatter of the contract. The said dispute disputed either way can effect\nthe pricing consideration in contract and thus the same cannot be the\none which can be said to be non arbitrable one especially when the\nagreement does not specifically provide it as an excepted matter\nunder the agreement.
