Indisputably, it is a settled\n                   legal proposition that conferment of\n                   jurisdiction     is    a    legislative\n                   function and it can neither be\n                   conferred with the consent of the\n                   parties nor by a superior Court, and\n                   if the Court passes a decree having\n                   no jurisdiction over the matter, it\n                   would amount to nullity as the\n                   matter goes to the roots of the\n                   cause. Such an issue can be raised\n                   at any stage of the proceedings. The\n                   finding of a Court or Tribunal\n                   becomes          irrelevant          and\n                   unenforceable/ inexecutable once the\n                   forum    is   found     to    have    no\n                   jurisdiction. Similarly, if a Court/\n                   Tribunal        inherently         lacks\n                   jurisdiction, acquiescence of party\n                   equally should not be permitted to\n                   perpetuate and perpetrate, defeating\n                   the legislative animation. The Court\n                   cannot   derive    jurisdiction    apart\n                   from    the     Statute.     In     such\n                   eventuality the doctrine of waiver\n                   also does not apply.

There is no doubt about\n                   either the meaning of the words used\n                   in the Section nor the intention.\n                   Simply put, there is a prohibition\n                   on the party from raising a plea\n                   that the Tribunal does not have\n                   jurisdiction after the party has\n                   submitted its statement of defence.\n                   The intention is very clear. So is\n                   the   mischief    that     it    seeks   to\n                   prevent.

They did not raise the\n                   question of jurisdiction at any\n                   stage. They did not raise it in\n                   their statement of defence; they did\n                   not raise it at any time before the\n                   Tribunal; they suffered the award;\n                   they preferred a petition under\n                   <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 34</a> and after two years\n                   raised the question of jurisdiction\n                   of the Tribunal.

This provision enables\n                   the court to set- aside an award\n                   which is in conflict with the public\n                   policy of India. Therefore, it is\n                   contended that the amendment had\n                   been rightly allowed and it cannot\n                   be said that what was raised was\n                   only a question which pertained to\n                   jurisdiction and ought to have been\n                   raised exclusively under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 16</a>\n                   of the Arbitration Act, 1996, but in\n                   fact was a question which could also\n                   have been raised under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 34</a>\n                   before the Court, as has been done\n                   by the Respondent. This submission\n                   must be rejected. The contention\n                   that an award is in conflict with\n                   the public policy of India cannot be\n                   equated with the contention that\n                   Tribunal under the Central Act does\n                   not   have   jurisdiction    and  the\n                   Tribunal under the State Act, has\n                   jurisdiction to decide upon the\n                   dispute. Furthermore, it was stated\n                   that this contention might have been\n                   raised under the head that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                           Page 28 of 103</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Sep 17 00:08:39 IST 2023</span>\n                                                                                NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n\n\n\nC/SCA/20116/2022                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 04/08/2023\n\n                                                                                undefined\n\n\n\n\n                   Arbitral Award is in conflict with\n                   the public policy of India. In other\n                   words, it was submitted that it is\n                   the public policy of India that\n                   arbitrations should be held under\n                   the    appropriate     law.    It    was\n                   contended      that      unless      the\n                   arbitration was held under the State\n                   Law i.e. the M.P. Act that it would\n                   be a violation of the public policy\n                   of   India.    This     contention    is\n                   misconceived since the intention of\n                   providing that the award should not\n                   be in conflict with the public\n                   policy of India is referable to the\n                   public policy of India as a whole\n                   i.e. the policy of the Union of\n                   India and not merely the policy of\n                   an individual state. Though, it\n                   cannot be said that the upholding of\n                   a state law would not be part of the\n                   public policy of India, much depends\n                   on the context. Where the question\n                   arises out of a conflict between an\n                   action under a State Law and an\n                   action under a Central Law, the term\n                   public    policy    of     India    must\n                   necessarily    understood     as   being\n                   referable to the policy of the\n                   Union.

Therefore,    it   is\n                   contended that the amendment had\n                   been rightly allowed and it\n                   cannot be said that what was\n                   raised was only a question which\n                   pertained to jurisdiction and\n                   ought   to   have    been    raised\n                   exclusively under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 16</a> of\n                   the Arbitration Act, 1996, but\n                   in fact was a question which\n                   could also have been raised\n                   under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 34</a> before the\n                   Court, as has been done by the\n                   Respondent. This submission must\n                   be rejected. The contention that\n                   an award is in conflict with the\n                   public policy of India cannot be\n                   equated with the contention that\n                   Tribunal under the Central Act\n                   does not have jurisdiction and\n                   the Tribunal under the State\n                   Act, has jurisdiction to decide\n                   upon the dispute.

It   was    contended    that\n                       unless the arbitration was held\n                       under the State Law i.e. the\n                       M.P. Act that it would be a\n                       violation of the public policy\n                       of India. This contention is\n                       misconceived since the intention\n                       of providing that the award\n                       should not be in conflict with\n                       the public policy of India is\n                       referable to the public policy\n                       of India as a whole i.e. the\n                       policy of the Union of India and\n                       not merely the policy of an\n                       individual state. Though, it\n                       cannot    be    said     that    the\n                       upholding of a state law would\n                       not be part of the public policy\n                       of India, much depends on the\n                       context.    Where    the    question\n                       arises out of a conflict between\n                       an action under a State Law and\n                       an action under a Central Law,\n                       the term public policy of India\n                       must necessarily be understood\n                       as being referable to the policy\n                       of the Union.

The\n                   issue however, raised was whether\n                   there was any bar to the plea of\n                   jurisdiction being raised by way of\n                   an objection under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_277\">Section 34</a> of the\n                   1996 Act even if no objection was\n                   raised under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_278\">Section 16</a> of that Act.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">                   It was opined that public policy of\n                   India refers to law enforced in\n                   India i.e., both Central law as well\n                   as the State law.

This Court in the context of\n                   the 1996 Act and the Adhiniyam,\n                   keeping in mind the cleavage of\n                   judicial view earlier and expounding\n                   on the law in that judgment has in\n                   succinct terms set out that the\n                   objections under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 34</a> of the\n                   said Act, where no such plea of\n                   jurisdiction     was      raised     in\n                   proceedings before the Arbitrator,\n                   should not be dealt with &quot;alone&quot; on\n                   the plea of jurisdiction i.e., it\n                   should be considered on merits. One\n                   can say that possibly this part of\n                   the order can also be read as one\n                   made   under  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_284\">Article    142</a>   of   the\n                   Constitution    of   India      to   do\n                   substantive justice inter se the\n                   parties, more so, when arbitration\n                   as an alternative dispute resolution\n                   mechanism presupposes an expeditious\n                   disposal of commercial disputes and\n                   that objective would stand nullified\n                   if a contrary view was taken.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">                   17.
