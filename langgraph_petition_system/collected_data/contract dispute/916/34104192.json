It is seen\n                                    that some High Courts have proceeded on the basis that any order\n                                    passed by an Arbitral Tribunal during arbitration, would be capable of\n                                    being challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 226</a> or 227 of the Constitution. We see no\n                                    warrant for such an approach. <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 37</a> makes certain orders of the\n                                    Arbitral Tribunal appealable. Under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 34</a>, the aggrieved party has\n                                    an avenue for ventilating its grievances against the award including any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 7800/2025                                                           Page 5 of 7</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">By:CHINU LUTHRA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Signing Date:02.06.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">21:49:33</span>\n                                  in between orders that might have been passed by the Arbitral Tribunal\n                                 acting under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 16</a> of the Act. The party aggrieved by any order of\n                                 the Arbitral Tribunal, unless has a right of appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 37</a> of\n                                 the Act, has to wait until the award is passed by the Tribunal. This\n                                 appears to be the scheme of the Act. The Arbitral Tribunal is, after all, a\n                                 creature of a contract between the parties, the arbitration agreement,\n                                 even though, if the occasion arises, the Chief Justice may constitute it\n                                 based on the contract between the parties. But that would not alter the\n                                 status of the Arbitral Tribunal. It will still be a forum chosen by the\n                                 parties by agreement. We, therefore, disapprove of the stand adopted by\n                                 some of the High Courts that any order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is\n                                 capable of being corrected by the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 226</a> or 227 of\n                                 the Constitution. Such an intervention by the High Courts is not\n                                 permissible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                                               xxx xxx xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                 46. The object of minimising judicial intervention while the matter is in\n                                 the process of being arbitrated upon, will certainly be defeated if the\n                                 High Court could be approached under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 227</a> or under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 226</a>\n                                 of the Constitution against every order made by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n                                 Therefore, it is necessary to indicate that once the arbitration has\n                                 commenced in the Arbitral Tribunal, parties have to wait until the award\n                                 is pronounced unless, of course, a right of appeal is available to them\n                                 under <a href=\"/doc/1656413/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 37</a> of the Act even at an earlier stage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"188959631\" id=\"span_32\">7.
