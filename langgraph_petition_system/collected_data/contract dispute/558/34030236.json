It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner company was awarded a \n\nwork order on 23.06.2014 for aluminium works in various towers being constructed \n\nby the respondent.   A  mobilization advance of Rs.93,95,691/­ was issued to the \n\npetitioner company which was secured against a bank guarantee in Development \n\nCredit Bank, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi.  In the petition, it is asserted that work \n\nwas completed by the petitioner company in Tower F against which bills were raised. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">Part payments were received leaving a balance of Rs.1,31,493/­.  It is alleged by the \n\npetitioner that subsequent to 30.12.2014 the respondent has not been approving the \n\ndrawings and the plans of the project.  There had been number of correspondences \n\nbetween the parties and eventually the respondent sent a courier dated 23.12.2015 \n\nterminating   the   contract   and   seeking   refund   of   Rs.93,95,691/­   through   bank \n\nguarantee.  In the petition, the petitioner has claimed that as on date Rs.28,00,000/­ \n\nhas been spent on design, consultancy, sight survey etc. and the petitioner admitted \n\nthat on cancellation of contract Rs.65,76,984/­ are payable which he has offered to \n\nrefund in six installments of Rs. 10,00,000/­ each.   The petitioner has prayed that \n\nrespondent is at fault and the petitioner has a good prima facie case of fraud in its \n\nfavour and against respondent and has special equities in the form of preventing \n\nirretrievable injustice.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.                          The respondent filed appearance and contested the contentions of the \n\npetitioner by refuting each and every allegation made in the petition inter alia stating \n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Arbitration no. 7/16</span>\nIndo Alusys Industries Ltd V. India Bulls Construction Ltd.                                Page no. 2 of 17\n that petitioner has not performed the contractual obligations which resulted in delay \n\nof the project  which is  evident from  the trail  of e­mails  exchanged between the \n\nparties.   The   respondent   submitted   that   the   petitioner   was   not   able   to   provide \n\ntechnical acceptable product / design to the respondent and the respondent being the \n\nsufferer on account of petitioner&#x27;s failure to complete even sample flats of Tower F \n\nand Tower A in the project, had finally written an e­mail dated 02.12.2015 to the \n\npetitioner whereby terminated the said work order as per clause 20 (a) of work order \n\non account of non adherence of technical acceptance, design / execution of work \n\nassigned.     The   respondent   vide   e­mail   dated   02.12.2015   also   requested   to   the \n\npetitioner to return the mobilization advance alongwith interest by 12.12.2015 failing \n\nwhich the same will be recovered by encashment of mobilization bank guarantee. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">Despite correspondences and meetings the petitioner failed to return mobilization \n\nadvance amount to the respondent.   It is next contended that bank guarantee is an \n\nindependent   contract   where   by   a   bank   undertakes   to   unconditionally   and \n\nunequivocally abide by its terms and it cannot be affected by disputes between the \n\nparties.   As per  agreed  clause 17 of duly executed work order dated 23.07.2014 \n\nbetween the parties the bank guarantee creates an irrevocable obligation on the bank \n\nto perform the contract in terms thereof and occurrence of events therein, the bank \n\nguarantee becomes enforceable.  There is no iota of evidence suggestive of the suit \n\nfalling under exceptional circumstances.   The termination of a contract may only \n\ngive rise to a dispute, the element of fraud is missing.  In the absence of any fraud \n\nthe   respondent   is   entitled   to   realize   the   bank   guarantee.     It   is   contended   that \n\ndefendant is a listed entity having a turnover of about Rs.650 crores which clearly \n\ndis­entitles  the  petitioner  to  claim  the  discretionary  relief  from  this   court.     It  is \n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Arbitration no. 7/16</span>\nIndo Alusys Industries Ltd V. India Bulls Construction Ltd.

It is further contended that the case of \n\nthe petitioner does not fall within the parameters which were made for seeking an \n\norder of restrain for encashment of bank guarantee.

India Bulls Construction Ltd.                                     Page no. 4 of 17\n 1644,   the   Hon&#x27;ble   Supreme   Court   of   India   has   dealt   with   the   law   relating   to \n\ninvocation of bank guarantee and observed that court should be slow in granting \n\ninjunction for realization of bank guarantee and carved out exceptions such as fraud \n\nand irretrievable injuries. The relevant paragraph nos. 11 to 15 are reproduced as \n\nunder :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">               11.     The law  relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is  \n               by   now well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings  \n               an     unconditional   bank guarantee   is   given   or accepted, the  \n               beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in   terms  \n               thereof   irrespective   of any   pending disputes. The   bank giving  \n               such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective  \n               of any  dispute raised by  its customer.  The very  purpose of giving  \n               such a bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The   courts  \n               should, therefore, be slow  in granting an injunction  to restrain the  \n               realization of  such  a  bank  guarantee. The courts have carved out  \n               only   two   exceptions.   A   fraud   in   connection   with   such   a   bank  \n               guarantee   would   vitiate   the   very   foundation   of   such   a   bank  \n               guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary  \n               seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained  from  doing so.  The  \n               second exception relates to cases where allowing the  encashment  \n               of  an unconditional bank  guarantee would  result in irretrievable  \n               harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most  \n               cases   payment of money under   such a   bank guarantee would  \n               adversely affect the  bank and  its customer at whose instance the  \n               guarantee is   given,   the harm or   injustice contemplated under  \n               this head must be of such an exceptional and irretrievable  nature  \n               as   would   override   the  terms   of   the  guarantee   and    the  adverse  \n               effect of such an injunction on commercial dealings  in the country.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">               The two grounds are not necessarily connected, though both  may  \n               co­exist in some cases. In the case  of U.P.  Cooperative Federation  \n               Ltd. v. Singh Consultants and Engineers (P) Ltd. (988 [1] SCC  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">               174), which was the case of works contract where the performance  \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Arbitration no. 7/16</span>\nIndo Alusys Industries Ltd V. India Bulls Construction Ltd.                                        Page no. 5 of 17\n                guarantee given under the contract was sought to be invoked, this  \n               Court, after referring extensively to English and Indian cases on  \n               the   subject,   said   that   the   guarantee   must   be   honoured   in  \n               accordance with its terms. The bank which gives the guarantee is  \n               not concerned in the  least  with the relations between the supplier  \n               and the customer; nor with the question whether the suppler has  \n               performed his contractual obligation or not, nor with the question  \n               whether   the   supplier   is   in   default   or   not.   The   bank   must   pay  \n               according to the tenor of its guarantee on demand without proof or  \n               condition. There are only   two exceptions to this rule. The   first  \n               exception is a case when there is a clear fraud of  which the bank  \n               has notice. The fraud must be of an agregious nature such as   to  \n               vitiate   the entire underlying transaction. Explaining the kind of  \n               fraud that may absolve a bank from honouring its guarantee, this  \n               Court in the above case quoted  with approval the observations  of  \n               Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in Bolivinter Oil SA v. Chase Manhattan  \n               Bank NA (1984   [1] AER   351 at 352): &quot;The wholly exceptional  \n               case where an injunction may  be granted  is where it is proved that  \n               the   bank  knows   that   any  demand   for   payment   already   made  or  \n               which may thereafter be made will clearly be fraudulent.  But the  \n               evidence must be clear both as to the fact of fraud and as to the  \n               bank&#x27;s knowledge.   It would certainly not normally be sufficient  \n               that this rests on the uncorroborated statement of the customer,  for  \n               irreparable damage can be done to a bank&#x27;s credit in the relatively  \n               brief   time   which   must   elapse   between   the   granting   of   such   an  \n               injunction and an application by the bank to have it charged&quot;. This  \n               Court   set   aside   an   injunction   granted     by   the   High   Court   to  \n               restrain the realisation of the bank guarantee. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">               12.       The same question came up for consideration before this  \n               Court in Svenska Handelsbanken v. M/s Indian Charge Chrome &amp;  \n               Ors. (1994  [1] SCC  502). The Court once  again reiterated that a  \n               confirmed   bank   guarantee/irrevocable   letter   of   credit   cannot   be  \n               interfered   with   unless   there   is   established   fraud   or   irretrievable  \n               injustice involved in the case.

Cooperative Federation Ltd.</a> (supra) and stated  \n               that the fraud must  be that of the beneficiary, and not the fraud of  \n               anyone else.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">               13.      On the question of irretrievable injury which is the second  \n               exception   to   the   rule   against   granting   of   injunctions   when  \n               unconditional bank guarantees are sought to be realised the court  \n               said <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_9\">in   <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_10\">the above case</a></a> that   the   irretrievable injury must   be of  \n               the kind which was the subject­matter of the decision in the Itek  \n               Corporation case (supra). In that case an exporter in the U.S.A.  \n               entered into an agreement with the Imperial Government of Iran  \n               and sought  an order terminating its liability on  stand by letters  of  \n               credit issued by an American bank in favour of an Iranian Bank as  \n               part   of   the   contract.   The   relief     was   sought   on   account   of   the  \n               situation  created after the Iranian revolution when the American  \n               Government cancelled  the export licences in relation to Iran and  \n               the Iranian  Government had  forcibly taken 52 American citizens  \n               as hostages. The U.S. Government had blocked  all Iranian  assets  \n               under   the   jurisdiction   of   United   States   and   had   cancelled   the  \n               export contract. The court upheld   the contention of the exporter  \n               that any claim for damages against the purchaser if decreed by the  \n               American   Courts   would   not   be   executable   in   Iran   under   these  \n               circumstances   and   relisation   of   the   bank   guarantee/Letters   of  \n               credit   would   cause   irreparable   harm   to   the   plaintiff.   This  \n               contention   was   upheld.   To   avail   of   this   exception,   therefore,  \n               exceptional   circumstances   which   make   it   impossible   for   the  \n               guarantor to reimburse himself if the ultimately succeeds, will have  \n               to be decisively established. Clearly, a mere apprehension that the  \n               other party will not be able to pay, is not  enough. In  the Itek case  \n               (supra) there was a certainty on this issue.

(JT  \n               1996 [1]  SC 156) where this Court has summed up the position by  \n               stating,   &quot;The   rule   is   well   established   that   a   bank   issuing   a  \n               guarantee is not concerned  with  the  underlying  contract between  \n               the   parties   to   the   contract.   The   duty   of   the   bank   under   a  \n               performance guarantee is created by the   document itself. Once  \n               the  documents  are  in  order  the  bank giving the guarantee must  \n               honour the  same and make payment ordinarily unless their  is an  \n               allegation of fraud or the like. The courts will not interfere directly  \n               or   indirectly   to   withhold   payment,   otherwise   trust   in   commerce  \n               internal and international would be irreparably  damaged. But that  \n               does not mean   that the parties to the underlying contract cannot  \n               settle the disputes with respect to allegations of breach by resorting  \n               to     litigation   or   arbitration   as   stipulated   in   the   contract.   The  \n               remedy arising ex­contract is not barred and the  cause of action  \n               for   the   same is   independent   of enforcement of the guarantee.&quot;  \n               The other recent decision is in <a href=\"/doc/1988070/\" id=\"a_11\">Hindustan  Steelworks Construction  \n               Ltd. v.

Clearly,  therefore, the existence  of any dispute between the  \n               parties to the contract  is not  a ground for issuing an  injunction to  \n               restrain the enforcement of bank guarantees. There   must be   a  \n               fraud  in connection  with the bank guarantee. In the present case  \n               we fail to see any such fraud. The High Court seems to have come  \n               to   the   conclusion   that   the   termination   of   the   contract   by   the  \n               appellant and his claim that the time was of the essence of the  \n               contract, are not based on  the terms of the contract and, therefore,  \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Arbitration no. 7/16</span>\nIndo Alusys Industries Ltd V.

This is  \n               an erroneous view. The disputes between the parties relating to  the  \n               termination   of the   contract cannot make invocation of the bank  \n               guarantees fraudulent. The High Court has also   refereed   to the  \n               conduct  of  the  appellant  in invoking the bank guarantees on an  \n               earlier   occasion   on   12th   of   April,   1992   and   subsequently  \n               withdrawing such invocation. The court has used this circumstance  \n               in   aid   of   its   view   that   the   time   was   not   of   the   essence   of   the  \n               contract. We fail to see  how an earlier  invocation of    the bank  \n               guarantees and subsequent withdrawal of this invocation  make the  \n               bank   guarantees   or   their   invocation   tainted   with   fraud   in   any  \n               manner. Under the terms of the contract it is stipulated that the  \n               respondent   is   required   to   give   unconditional   bank   guarantees  \n               against advance payments  as  also a similar bank guarantee for  \n               due delivery of the contracted plant within the stipulated period. In  \n               the absence of any fraud the appellant is entitled to realise the  \n               bank guarantees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55168630\" id=\"span_18\">6.

In   contracts  \n                  awarded   to   private   individuals   by   the   Government,   which  \n                  involve   huge   expenditure,   as,   for   example,   construction  \n                  contracts,   Bank   Guarantees   are   usually   required   to   be  \n                  furnished in  favour  of  the  Government  to secure  payments  \n                  made to the contractor as &quot;advance&quot; from time to time during  \n                  the course of the contract as also to secure performance of  \n                  the work entrusted under the contract. Such Guarantees are  \n                  excusable   in   terms   thereof   on   the   lapse   of   the   contractor  \n                  either in the performance of the work or in paying back to the  \n                  &quot;Government   Advance&quot;,   the   Guarantee   is   invoked   and   the  \n                  amount is recovered from the Bank. It is for this reason that  \n                  the Courts are reluctant in granting an injunction against the  \n                  invocation of Bank Guarantee, except in the case of fraud,  \n                  which should be an established fraud, or where irretrievable  \n                  injury was likely to be caused to the Guarantor.

What is important, therefore, is that the Bank Guarantee  \n                  should be in unequivocal terms, unconditional and recite that  \n                  the amount would be paid without demur or objection and  \n                  irrespective   of   any   dispute   that   might   have   cropped   up   or  \n                  might have been pending between the beneficiary under the  \n                  Bank   Guarantee   or   the   person   on   whose   behalf   the  \n                  Guarantee was furnished. The terms of the Bank Guarantee  \n                  are, therefore, extremely material. Since the Bank Guarantee  \n                  represents an independent contract between the Bank and the  \n                  beneficiary, both the parties would be bound by the terms  \n                  thereof.

No dispute to the  \n                  fact that the petitioner had furnished three bank guarantees to  \n                  respondent No.1. Two were of the nature of performance bank  \n                  guarantees and the other bank guarantee is a security bank  \n                  guarantee against the advance.

The petitioner  has contended that the bank guarantees  \n                  have been obtained by fraud because the respondent No.1  \n                  was aware from the very beginning that it would not be able  \n                  to handover the vacant possession of the site and since it has  \n                  failed   to   handover   the   vacant   possession   of   the   site,   the  \n                  petitioner could not complete his part of obligation under the  \n                  contract. The respondent, on the contrary, has alleged that it  \n                  was   the   petitioner   who   had   defaulted   in   performance   and  \n                  had not fulfilled his part of the contract. Hence, the dispute  \n                  has arisen between the parties regarding the fulfilment of the  \n                  obligations under the contract by both the parties and this  \n                  has   arisen   during   performance   of   the   contract.   The   bank  \n                  guarantees, on the other hand, were submitted at the initial  \n                  stage at the time of entering the contract. It is not shown by  \n                  the   petitioner   that   it   was   at   that   time   that   any   fraud   of  \n                  egregious nature had been played upon him. The petitioner  \n                  had entered into the contract on its own free will and has not  \n                  alleged   that   it   was   forced   into   this   contract.   It   has   been  \n                  admitted on behalf of the petitioner that before bidding, the  \n                  petitioner was required to do the site inspection and the same  \n                  was done. It, therefore, cannot be said that any fraud, what to  \n                  say of egregious nature, had been played upon it, at the time  \n                  of execution of the present bank guarantees. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158014472\" id=\"span_29\">12.

The dispute between the  \n          parties to the underlying contract has to be decided at the civil forum  \n          i.e. a civil suit if there exists no arbitration clause in the contract or  \n          before the arbitral tribunal if there exists an arbitration clause in the  \n          contract. Pendency of arbitration proceedings is no consideration while  \n          deciding on the issue of grant of an interim injunction. That certain  \n          amounts   have   been   recovered   under   running   bills   and   have   to   be  \n          adjusted for is of no concern in matters relating to invocation of bank  \n          guarantee.   That   there   are   serious   disputes   on   questions   as   to   who  \n          committed the breach of the contract are no circumstances justifying  \n          granting an injunction pertaining to a bank guarantee. Plea of lack of  \n          good faith and/or enforcing the guarantee with an oblique purpose or  \n          that   the   bank   guarantee   is   being   invoked   as   a   bargaining   chip,   a  \n          deterrent or in an abusive manner are all irrelevant and hence have to  \n          be ignored. There are only two well recognized exceptions to the rule  \n          against permitting payment under a bank guarantee. The same are:­ \n\n          A. A fraud of egregious nature;</span> \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">          B. Encashment of the bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm  \n          or injustice of an irreversible kind to one of the parties.&quot; \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">          13. The petitioner  has  also contended that since the intention of the  \n          respondent in invoking the bank guarantee is to enrich itself and this not  \n          only is a fraudulent act on its part, but also inequitable. As discussed  \n          above, the fraud of egregious nature played upon the petitioner has to  \n          be fraud which has been played upon the petitioner at the time when the  \n          bank guarantees were executed by him. The fraud should be of such a  \n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Arbitration no. 7/16</span>\nIndo Alusys Industries Ltd V.

It has also been held by this Court  \n          in <a href=\"/doc/158014472/\" id=\"a_24\">Consortium of Deepak Cable India Limited</a> (supra) that Courts are  \n          precluded from considering the disputes between the parties arising out  \n          of   the   main   contract,   while   dealing   with   the   matters   relating   to  the  \n          encashment of the bank guarantees. The existence of a dispute between  \n          the parties on account of failure of the terms of the contract does not in  \n          any way affect the right of the beneficiary to encash the bank guarantee.</span>  \n          The   petitioner   has   also   failed   to   show   that   he   shall   suffer   an  \n          irretrievable injury if the stay is not granted to it. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">7.                          The Hon&#x27;ble Courts while dealing with the question of fraud has held \n\nthat fraud was to be established fraud. The fraud should be such which would vitiate \n\nthe very foundation of the bank guarantee. If such a fraud of which the beneficiary \n\nintends to take advantage, the other party must show that the bank guarantee has \n\nbeen fraudulently obtained.  The second exception to the rule of granting injunction \n\ni.e. restitution of irretrievable injury, has to be such a circumstance which would \n\nmake it impossible for guarantor to reimburse himself if he ultimately succeeded.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">8.                          In  the  instant  case,  petitioner  is  seeking  stay  of operation  of  mail \n\ndated 22.12.2015 and restraining respondent from encashing the bank guarantee.
