The partnership agreement, therefore,\ncomes to an end and so also the\narbitration clause.  Nothing more exists; the accounts have to\nbe settled.  The issue of dissolution is no more left and it is over\nand even otherwise the partnership comes to an end and as a result,\nthis dispute cannot be referred to arbitration under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_22\">section 8</a> of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">4.4\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocates for the petitioners have then submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1647289/\" id=\"a_23\">section\n44</a> of the Act is related to  independent right of dissolution and\nthat too independent of <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_24\">section 43</a> of the Act.  <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 43</a> only\napplies when the partnership is at will, whereas <a href=\"/doc/1647289/\" id=\"a_26\">section 44</a> applies\nto all types of partnership. They have further submitted that this is\na partnership at Will and the dissolution took place under <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_27\">section 43</a>\nby mere notice and it is deeming dissolution without  adjudication\nand so there is no need going for arbitration, unlike <a href=\"/doc/1647289/\" id=\"a_28\">section 44</a>\nwhich requires adjudication on various disputes by the court.  They\nhave then submitted that once the partnership is dissolved, there\ncannot be a question of continuing the  partnership firm for any\nother purpose.  Even if it is a partnership at will, the partners can\nchoose other means to dissolve it also.  Nothing prohibits the\npartners from doing so but that dissolution will be under <a href=\"/doc/1567968/\" id=\"a_29\">section 40</a>\nof the Act which provides for dissolution by agreement but not under\n<a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_30\">section 43</a> of the Act.  Thus if the partnership is at will, one can\ngo under <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_31\">section 43</a> and if it is not at will, then suit has to be\nfiled under <a href=\"/doc/1647289/\" id=\"a_32\">section 44</a> of the Act.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">4.5\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocates for the petitioners have then submitted that in a\ngenuine case under <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_33\">section 43</a> of the Act there are three judgments at\nserial numbers 1 to 3  shown in para 4.1 referred above of our High\nCourt and as held by it there cannot be anything to refer to the\narbitration qua actual dissolution  as it is over and under such\ncircumstances, the petitioners must be entitled to their legal\nright/statutory right and so far as this point is concerned, lastly\nthey have submitted that in a partnership at will, because there is\nno adjudication, once notice dated  26.7.2012 is issued as per law,\nit got dissolved and there is no question of any referability to\narbitration, as <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_34\">section 43</a> of the Act is a deeming provision.

Ahmedi, J (As His Lordship Then was)\nwhich reads as under:</span>\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\"> 5.\n No provision is made in the partnership deed fixing the duration of\nthe partnership and, therefore, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_36\">section 7</a> of the\nPartnership Act, where no such provision is made by contract between\nthe partners, the partnership is a  partnership at will . <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n43</a> of the Partnership Act next provides that where the partnership is\nat will, the firm may be dissolved by any partner giving notice in\nwriting to all the other partners of his intention to dissolve the\nfirm. Once such a notice is given, the firm is dissolved as from the\ndate mentioned in the notice as the date of dissolution or, if no\ndate is so mentioned, as from the date of the communication of the\nnotice. It is well-settled that if a suit is instituted for the\ndissolution of the partnership and for rendition of accounts, the\nservice of the summons along with the copy of the plaint on the other\npartners is notice of dissolution within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_38\">section 43</a> of\nthe Partnership Act. It is, therefore, obvious that if in a\npartnership at will one of the partners does not desire to carry on\nbusiness in partnership with the other partners and serves notice of\ndissolution, the firm stands dissolved from the date of dissolution\nmentioned in the notice and if no such date is mentioned, from the\ndate of communication of the notice to the other partners. That is\nthe effect of <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_39\">section 43</a> of the Partnership Act.  It is in this\ncontext of this statutory position emerging from a conjoint\nreading of <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_40\">section 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_41\">sec. 43</a> of the Partnership Act, that one has\nto determine the scope of\nclause (16) of the partnership deed. Now, that clause states that if\nthere is any dispute in regard to any matter concerning the firm\nbetween the partners, without resorting to the court of law the\npartners shall have it determined under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_42\">Arbitration Act</a> through\nan arbitrator and the decision of the arbitrator will be binding on\nall the partners. If under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/107341/\" id=\"a_43\">Partnership Act</a> it\nis open to a partner to dissolve a partnership at will in the manner\nprovided by <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_44\">section 43</a> of the Partnership Act, that right conferred\non a partner cannot be denied to him on the interpretation that\nclause (16) of the partnership deed is wide enough to  cover any and\nevery dispute between the partners.  If a partner does not desire to\ncarry on business with his other partners and has a right to dissolve\nthe firm under sec 43 of the <a href=\"/doc/107341/\" id=\"a_45\">Partnership Act</a>,  can it be said on an\ninterpretation of clause (16) of the partnership deed that that right\nis taken away and the partner has no remedy but to continue with the\npartnership assuming the arbitrator holds against him in the\nproceedings that may be commenced under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_46\">Arbitration Act</a> ? The\nanswer to this poser must necessarily be in the negative. In a\npartnership at will it is open to a partner even if there is no\ndispute between the partners whatsoever to dissolve the firm by\nvirtue of <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_47\">section 43</a> of the Partnership Act. That section does not\nlay down that there must exist a dispute between\nthe partners for the purpose of dissolving the firm. All that it says\nis that if the partnership is at\nwill, it is open to any partner to dissolve the firm by giving notice\nin writing to all the other partners of his intention so to do and on\nthe service of such notice the partnership will stand dissolved from\nthe date mentioned in the notice or from the date of communication,\nas the case may be. Therefore, in a partnership at will if a partner\ndesires to dissolve the firm by giving notice as required by <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_48\">sec.43</a>\nof the Partnership Act, his right cannot be taken away by such an\narbitration clause in the partnership deed.  If it was the intention\nof the partners that the partnership should not be dissolved till a\ncertain event happens, than such a specific provision would have been\nfound in the document and the partnership would not have been a\npartnership at will. It is, therefore, difficult to understand how a\npartner who desires to dissolve the firm can be forced to resort to\narbitration. It, therefore, necessarily follows that clause (16) of\nthe partnership deed has application only during the subsistence of\nthe partnership and it does not have the effect of taking away the\nright conferred on a partner by <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_49\">sec. 43</a> of the Partnership Act to\nhave the partnership dissolved by notice if the partnership is a\npartnership at will.  On  this interpretation as regards the scope of\nclause (16) of the partnership deed, it must be held that the learned\ntrial Judge was not right in staying further \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nproceedings\nin the suit order <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_50\">sec. 34</a> of the Arbitration Act. \n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">5.\t\tLearned\nSenior Advocate Mr Kamal Trivedi as well as learned Advocate Mr\nSanjay Mehta and Learned Advocate Mr U.D. Shukla for the respondents\nhave submitted that the controversy lies in a very narrow compass. \nWhen the partnership has been admitted as partnership at will and\nthere is no dispute that the partnership is at will, it stands\nautomatically dissolved when one partner issues notice for\ndissolution and in such eventuality one partner cannot say that he\nwants to refer the issue to the arbitrator.  In support of their\nsubmissions, following six judgments have been pressed into service\nby the learned senior Advocates for the petitioners:\n</p> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(i)\t1982\n(1) GLR 312\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(ii)\t2001\n(4) \tGLR 3168\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(iii)\t2006\n(3) GLR 2582\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(iv)\t1984\nGLH \t(U.J.) 24\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(v)\tAIR\n1968 Guj. 157\n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(vi)\tAIR 1924 Privy\nCouncil 2\n \n\n\t\tLearned\nSenior Advocate for the respondents has then submitted that in the\nabove referred judgments,  whether partnership is at will or not was\nnever in dispute and it was in that context this court took the view\nthat the firm having been dissolved, the question cannot be referred\nto the arbitrator for dissolution.  As such these judgments cannot be\napplied as precedent to the facts of the present case.\n</blockquote> \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">5.1\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocates for the respondents has then submitted that this is\na case where there is serious disputes about the nature of the\npartnership which according to the respondents  partnership  is not\nat will.  In such circumstances,  there is no embargo in the eye of\nlaw for reference of the matter relating to the dissolution and\naccounts which are today the subject matter pending in civil suit\nwhich must be referred to the arbitrator.  According to the\nrespondents, when there is clause relating to arbitration, the trial\ncourt has rightly referred all these matters to the arbitrator and\nthere is nothing wrong in it.\n</p> \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">5.2\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocate for the respondents has further submitted that the\nsuit partnership is not a partnership at will as sought to be\ninterpreted and stated by the petitioners and, therefore, the\npetitioners have no right to seek dissolution of partnership firm. \nAccording to the respondents, the true and correct interpretation of\nrelevant clauses of partnership deed dated 27.7.1999 are required to\nbe scrutinised thoroughly. Learned senior Advocate for the\nrespondents have submitted that in the suit firm there is a provision\nfor determination of partnership.  As per clause 12, it is\nspecifically agreed upon by and between the partners that in case any\npartner is desirous of retiring, he may retire by giving two months \nadvance notice to the rest of the partners after settling the\naccounts and that on account of  said reason, the said partnership\nshall not be deemed to have been dissolved but the remaining partners\nthemselves or by  inducing third parties as partners, can continue in\nthe said partnership firm.  They have further submitted that thus in\nview of specific agreement between the partners, intention of the\nparties is that even if some of the partners do not intend to carry\non in partnership, the partnership cannot be determined although such\npartners may withdraw from partnership and terminate legal\nrelationships between themselves, the other partners and partnership\nwill continue between the remaining partners unless all partners\nmutually agree to determine the relationship.  If one reads all the\nclauses, there is something with reference to the  mode of\ndetermination of a firm. This mode of determination has impliedly\n<a href=\"/doc/1376863/\" id=\"a_51\">laid down in</a> clauses 12 and that is why one may not call it\ngenuine/pure and simple will as has been tried to make out by the\npetitioners.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">5.2.1\t\tTo\ncompare the relevant clauses, learned senior Advocates for the\nrespondents have placed reliance on the following decisions:\n</p> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(i)\tAIR\n1991 SC 1020\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(ii)\tAIR\n2005 Bombay 301\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(iii)\tAIR\n1982 Delhi 131\n \n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(iv)\tAIR\n2007 MP 153\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\nIt\nis then submitted that clause 12 is required to be read carefully and\nwhen the said clause is compared with other clauses which are there\nin the decisions rendered in various judgments, they are resembling  \nvery much similar. It is submitted that in all the judgments and\ndecisions, it is taken that the partnership is not at will, because \nthere is intention that on happening of all these events, the firm\nwill not be deemed to have been dissolved but the rest of the\npartners will be at liberty to carry out the partnership either by\nthemselves or inducting third party as partner, which requires\nconsideration because there is an arbitration clause, which covers\neverything.  Lastly learned senior Advocates for the respondents have\nsubmitted that whether it is a partnership at will or not, the said\nquestion also go to arbitration and the arbitrator will have the\npower to decide whether it is a partnership at will or not.  On the\ninterpretation of partnership deed, when two groups have opposite\nviews which is a dispute related to partnership agreement it clearly\nfalls under clause 17 and, therefore, it needs to go to arbitration.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">6.\t\tSo\nfar as the above referred point is concerned, I have considered the\nabove rival submissions made by the learned senior Advocates for the\nparties in light of the decisions relied upon by them.  <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 7</a> of\nthe Act deals with partnership at will, which reads as under:\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\"> 7.\n Partnership at will   Where no provision is made by contract\nbetween the partners for the duration of their partnership, or for\nthe determination of their partnership, the partnership is\n partnership at will . \n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">6.1\t\t<a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_53\">Section\n7</a> says that where no provision is made by the partners for the\nduration of their partnership, or for the determination of their\npartnership, then the partnership is at will.  Duration or\ndetermination of a partnership may be expressed or may in given\ncircumstances be implied.  As <a href=\"/doc/1376863/\" id=\"a_54\">referred above</a>, to find out resembling\nsimilarity related to clause 12 of the Partnership deed dated\n27.7.1999, the respondents placed reliance on  the decisions shown in\npara 5.2.1 above.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">6.2\t\tClauses\n4 and  5 of the partnership deed mentioned in para 9 in AIR 1991 SC\n1020 reads as under:\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\"> 9.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\"> The material question is whether the partnership deed Ex.B1, is at\nwill. Clause (3) specifies the shares of the partners and clauses (4)\nand (5) read thus \n\n \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> (4)</span>\nThe business of the firm has been started on the 1st of\nJuly, 1962 and the partnership will be brought to an end at will \n \n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">(5)</span>\n The partnership will continue till there are two partners, even in\nthe case of one or several partners withdraw themselves or die, the\npartnership will continue between the two partners, will remain\nowners of all the capital, on condition that they should pay back to\nthe withdrawing partners and to the heirs of the deceased partners,\nonly the amount of their rights according to the last inventory. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\t\tReferring\nto the above clause 5, the Hon ble Supreme Court has taken a view\nthat the firm is not a  partnership at will .  Since there is a\nprovision in the partnership deed that partnership shall continue so\nlong as there are two partners and that is the basis on which the\nSupreme Court took the view that since there is a provision of\nduration of partnership, it is not a  partnership at will .\nClause 12  of the case on hand mentioned in para 2 hereinabove is\ncompared with the above referred clause 5, I find there is major\ndifference. In clause 12 of the instant case there is provision only\nfor retirement and so this decision, in my view, will\nnot be helpful to the respondents.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">6.3\t\tReferring\nto para 17 of the decision reported in AIR 1991 SC 1020, it appears\nthat while deciding the said case, the Hon ble Supreme Court has\nreferred and relied upon the decision reported in AIR 1961 SC 1225. \nIn the said case i.e. AIR 1961 SC 1225, the partnership was only for\nthe purpose of carrying on business of managing agency of two mills. \nThere was no other purpose of  partnership. The terms of agreement\nshown in it  clearly  establishes that the intention could not be to\ncreate partnership at will. The partners contemplated the management\nand would be carrying on for four years period and that too carry on\nbusiness of management in rotation.  Considering this provision as\nwell as nature of business of partnership, it could not contemplate\nthat the partnership could be brought to an end by notice by either\nof the parties, but on the contrary it appears that if the managing\nagency is terminated then, the partnership at will come to an end\nbecause termination of the partnership can be seen impliedly from the\nsaid fact and thus there was provision of determination of\npartnership.  This case also will not come to any help to the\nrespondents.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">6.4\t\tSo\nfar as the case reported in AIR 2005 Bombay 301 is concerned it was\nargued by learned counsel  Mr Godbole for the respondent of the said\ncase that clause 12 of the partnership\ndeed has provided for the mode and manner of making accounts and the\nrespondents therein had no option to go as per that clause. Then Mr\nGodbole placed reliance on the reported decision in AIR 1961 SC 1225\nand in para 10 the court concerned has taken the view that since\nclauses 11 and 12 of the partnership deed are explicitly clear that\nthe partnership was not at will.  It is further observed by the court\nthat, in law, so far as this  revision or appeal is concerned which\nis against the interim order, it has to be prima facie held that the\npartnership was not at Will and that there was no dissolution.  The\nfact related to the second observation is very important, which in my\nview, is missing so far as this case on hand is concerned. It was the\ncase of the plaintiff in the above referred  case that the\npartnership stood dissolved upon service of his  notice and then in\nhis application for appointment of court receiver, the plaintiff\ntherein has contended that the partnership business was required to\nbe continued, otherwise he was going  to suffer loss and therefore,\nfor continuation of business appointment of receiver was necessary.\nThe trial court found that these two stands taken by the plaintiff\nwere contradictory\nto each other. If the partnership is at will and the plaintiff has \ndissolved partnership under <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_55\">section 43</a> of the Act then there was no\ncontinuation of business and if the plaintiff wanted\ncontinuation of business, then impliedly the plaintiff could not\ncontend that he has dissolved the partnership. The High Court i.e.\nthe court concerned has then observed that the partnership was not at\nwill and there was no dissolution and secondly, since the prayer of\nthe petitioner/plaintiff was for continuation of business it was\ncontradicted by his stand taken about dissolution of firm. The court\nwas, therefore, rightly justified in rejecting the said application.\nThus, in my view, so far as the case on hand is concerned, no\ncontradictory prayer is there and so the above referred\nobservations/views of the  court will not be applicable to the\npresent case.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">6.4.1\t\tBefore\nwe discuss the above referred judgment i.e. AIR 2005 Bombay 301,\nlearned senior Advocate for the petitioners has placed reliance on\ntwo decisions   (1) AIR 1968 Guj. 157 and (2) AIR 1976 Bombay 405\nand submitted that while deciding AIR 2005 Bombay 301 the court\nconcerned has not noticed the judgment of the learned Single Judge \nof the  Bombay High Court i.e. AIR 1976 Bombay 405 nor relied on\n(1991) 1 SCC 1020 and so it is per incuriam and therefore, it is not\nbinding to this court. So first of all I will go through the above\ntwo decisions referred by the learned senior Advocates for the\npetitioners and then I will sum up the above referred decisions -\n AIR 2005 Bombay 301  on which the respondents have placed\nreliance.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">6.4.2\t\tAIR\n1968 Guj. 157 - This judgment is of much importance because it is\ndecided by the Division Bench of this High Court and in my view, it\nis binding to this court vis-a-vis any other High Court except the\nHon ble Supreme Court.  I have carefully gone through the same. The\nrelevant clauses 6 and 7 respectively of  partnership at will \nand retirement of partners are narrated in para 1.  After discussing\nall the important aspects at length, the Division Bench of this Court\nhas come to its conclusion in para 3 as under:\n</p> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">\t The\nconclusion which we must, therefore, inevitably reach is that the\nretirement of partner from a firm does  not dissolve, the firm, that\nis determine the partnership inter-se between all the partners but\nmerely severs the partnership between the retiring partner and the\ncontinuing partners leaving the  partnership amongst the continuing\npartners unaffected and the firm continues with the changed\nconstitution comprising the continuing partners. \n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">\t\tSo\nfar as clause 7 is concerned, it further finds in para 5 that it is\nclear from the foregoing discussions that clause 7 of the partnership\ndeed which contains provision for retirement of a partner which is\nnot constituted an expressed provision made by contract between the\npartners for determination of  their partnership  within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_56\">section 7</a> and, therefore, it is not operated to exclude\nthe partnership from the category of partnership at will. \nDissolution of the partnership between all the partners is what is\ncontemplated in the definition of partnership at will and retirement\nof a partner has no bearing on it.  Learned Advocates for the\npetitioners have then submitted that so far as the partnership at\nwill is concerned, this judgment of Division Bench is binding\nauthority which binds this court and I am in agreement with the same.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">6.4.3\t\tHead\nnote  A  of the decision reported in AIR 1976 Bombay 405 reads as\nunder:\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\"><a href=\"/doc/107341/\" id=\"a_57\">(A)\nPartnership Act</a> (9 of 1932) <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_58\">section 7</a>   partnership at will  \nprovision in deed as to retirement of partner is not provision for\n determination of their partnership  within meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_59\">section 7</a>.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\"><a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_60\">Section\n7</a> makes it clear that two conditions must be satisfied before it can\nbe said that a particular partnership is a partnership at will or to\nput it differently the deed of partnership must not contain any\nprovisions whether express or implied as to (a)   the duration of\ntheir partnership  or (b)  for the determination of their\npartnership .  If these two provisions are absent or cannot be\nimplied then the partnership will be at the will. Whether they are\ncalled conditions or exceptions the fact remains that there should be\nno provision in the contract for determination of their partnership.\nWhat <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_61\">section 7</a> refers to is not a provision far the duration of the\npartnership but a provision for the duration of their partnership.\nThis means that the deed of partnership must contain a provision for\nthe duration of the partnership consisting of all the partners\nconcerned that is to say a partnership in which each of the existing\npartners is partner.  Similarly, the determination is to be of their\npartnership and not a partnership from which one of the  partners has\nbeen excluded. The retirement of a partner merely severs the\npartnership between the retiring partner and the continuing partners\nleaving the partnership amongst the continuing partners unaffected\nand the firm continues with the changed constitution comprising the\ncontinuing partners. It follows that any provision in a partnership\ndeed as to the retirement of a partner whether conditional or\notherwise, whether at a moment s notice or of a specified period\nand whether on taking accounts or without taking accounts, cannot be\nconsidered to be a provision for determination of their partnership\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1990193/\" id=\"a_62\">section 7</a>. AIR 1968 Guj. 157, Followed: AIR\n1961 SC 1225, Relied on .\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">While\ndeciding the above referred case, the concerned learned Single Judge\nof Bombay High Court has referred and relied upon the above referred\ncitation i.e. AIR 1968 Guj. 157  delivered by this court and thus the\nBombay High Court while deciding the above referred case, has\nfollowed the judgment rendered by Division Bench of  Gujarat High\nCourt. While deciding the case of  AIR 2005 Bombay 301, the judgment\nof learned Single Judge of Bombay High Court in AIR 1976 Bombay 405\nis completely ignored and it has also not noticed the decision\nreported in AIR 1991 SC 1020. It is the submissions of the learned\nsenior Advocates for the petitioners that if the binding decision of\nthe High Court is not noticed by the court, then it is per incuriam.\nThe learned senior Advocate for the respondents has relied upon\nclauses 11 and 12 of the decision reported in AIR 2005 Bombay 301 and\nas per the same, if all the partners decided to close the partnership\nbusiness then the business has to be sold on the basis of goodwill\nand  each of the partners is to be given according to his share. \nThis clause 12  was not there before the decision of AIR\n1976 Bombay 405 and so AIR 2005 Bombay 301 is not per incuriam\nbecause the clauses are different.  There appears no substance in the\nabove submissions made by the learned senior advocate for the\nrespondents. As per the submissions made\nby the learned senior Advocates for the petitioners, if binding\ndecision of the High Court is not noticed by the court, then it is\nper incuriam.  I find substance in the submissions made by the\nlearned senior Advocates for the petitioners and on this count also\nthe judgment reported in AIR 2005 301 will not be helpful to the case\nof the respondents.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">6.5\t\tReferring\nto para 24 of the citations reported in 1982 Delhi 131, it appears\nthat AIR 1968 Guj. 157 was referred at length and the learned Single\nJudge of Delhi High Court has not disapproved the ratio laid down and\nthe findings arrived at by the Division Bench of this Court <a href=\"/doc/1376863/\" id=\"a_63\">referred\nabove</a>.

As referred hereinabove, so far as\nclause 12 is concerned, and comparing the same with other  clauses of\nvarious decisions, there appears no resemblance or similarity and I\nam of the view that the conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench\nof this court in AIR 1968 Guj. 157 is squarely applicable to the case\non hand.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">As\n<a href=\"/doc/1376863/\" id=\"a_64\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1376863/\" id=\"a_65\">the said decision</a>, the matter of retirement of a partner\nand dissolution of partnership are altogether different things\ncovered by different clauses of partnership deed and provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/107341/\" id=\"a_66\">Partnership Act</a>.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">6.7.1.\t\tIn\npara 12 of the impugned order dated 30.1.2013 passed below Exhs. 18\nand 21, the trial court has also observed that it is not in dispute\nthat the partnership deed mark 4/1 is unregistered firm and on plan\n(sic) reading of clause 9 of the partnership deed, it appears that\nthe suit partnership is a  partnership at will .  In reply to the\nnotice dated 24.8.2012 by the respondents, the respondents have not\nspecifically denied that the partnership is not a  partnership at\nwill  and only at the stage of notice of Motion in para 16 this\nissue is made out that the suit partnership is not a  partnership\nat will  as sought to be interpreted and stated by the\nplaintiffs/petitioners.  Learned senior Advocates for the petitioners\nhave submitted that by mere single line denial that the partnership\nis not at will and there is a serious dispute about the nature of\npartnership and so there is no embargo in the eye of law for\nreference of the dispute to the arbitration will not take away the\nlegal and statutory right of the petitioners which the petitioners\nhave derived under clause 9 of\nthe partnership deed.  As such in view  of the provisions of the Act,\nmore particularly <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_67\">section 43</a> of the Act, the court concerned has no\ndiscretion to grant a decree of dissolution and/or refuse to grant a\ndecree of dissolution, inasmuch as, the conditions precedent for the\npurpose of applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_68\">section 43</a> is satisfied  then by\noperation of law itself, the firm stands dissolved and accordingly it\nis for the Hon ble Court to declare dissolution of the firm.  From\nthe above discussion, I am of the view that the partnership deed\ndated 27.7.1999 is a partnership at will as per clause 9 of the\npartnership deed. Now the important question to be decided is whether\nin the partnership at will, issue of dissolution can be referred to\narbitration as submitted by the learned senior Advocate for the\nrespondents or it cannot be referred to arbitration as has been\nargued by the learned Senior Advocates for the petitioners under\n<a href=\"/doc/797638/\" id=\"a_69\">section 69</a> of the Act more particularly when the partnership firm is\nnot a registered one.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"626959\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_16\">7.\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocates for the petitioners have then submitted that the\ntrial court has mainly placed reliance on a decision relied on by the\nrespondents reported in  <a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_70\">Prabhu\nShankar Jaiswal v.

So far as the sub-sections (1) and (2) and main part of\nsubsection (3) is concerned they have set out certain prohibitions\nand certain things in respect of unregistered partnership firm which\ncannot be done.  However, to these prohibitions, we find exceptions\nwhich are set out in clause  (a) of sub-section (3), and clause (b)\nof sub-section (3) and sub-section (4).  For the purpose of the\ndispute involved in this case sub section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/797638/\" id=\"a_90\">section 69</a> is\nimportant to be looked into.  Sub section (3) provides that\nsub-sections (1) and (2) would also apply to a claim of set-off or\nother proceedings to enforce a right, arising from a contract but\nshall not affect three things and three things can go to arbitration.\nThe dispute if, it is referred to arbitration, must be falling within\nthese three exceptions (1) dissolution of firm (2) accounts of a\ndissolved firm and (3) release of properties of the dissolved firm.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">7.4\t\tThe\nmain submissions  on the part of the learned senior advocates for the\npetitioners is that clause 17 of the partnership deed is falling\nwithin the arbitration, but it does not fall within three exceptions\nand since  it was not falling within three exceptions it cannot go to\narbitration because the firm is not registered.  Referring the reply\nfiled by the respondents to the  Notice of Motion Exh. 23, copy of\nwhich is in Appeal from Order at page 84 para 16, the learned senior\nAdvocates for the petitioners have submitted  that  a single line\nspecific plea has been taken by the respondents that the suit\npartnership  firm is not a partnership at will. The petitioners are\ncontending that it is a partnership at will and the respondents are\ndisputing that contention. Thus, when the respondents are contending\nthat this is not a partnership at will, then it is the issue arising\nfrom the contract. The moment the respondents raised the contention\nthat the suit partnership firm is not a partnership at will, then\nthat issue is the issue arising out of  contract of partnership and\nnot for dissolution of the firm and not for accounts and not for\nrecovery of the properties of the firm and so that issue does not \nfall under <a href=\"/doc/1336935/\" id=\"a_91\">section 69(3) (a)</a> of the Act and as a result that issue\ncannot be referred to the Arbitration if the firm is not registered.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1012649\" id=\"span_27\">7.4.1\t\tIn\nthis regard, the petitioners have placed reliance on para 21 of a \ndecision reported in <a href=\"/doc/1012649/\" id=\"a_92\">Sheth Loonkaran Shethiya v.

There is no dispute as regards the right arising\nfrom the contract of a firm. The dispute is only with regard to\nworking out the rights flown from dissolution for settlement of\naccounts of the dissolved firm or any right or power to realise the\nproperty of the dissolved firm etc. That right would form part of the\n\texception engrafted in sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/797638/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 69</a>. The object\nintended by the legislature appears to be that in  spite of the\ndefect of non-registration and the prohibition created in the main\npart of non-enforceability of the right arising from a contract, the\nparties having worked under that contract, to the limited extent of\nthe enforcement of a right to realise the assets, settlement of the\naccounts of the dissolved firm or any right or power to realise the\nproperty of the dissolved firm are exceptions engrafted therein and\ngives right to the parties to enforce the same, independent of the\nright arising from the contract.

Justice\nAhmadi as a Judge of Gujarat High Court, took the view that in the\ncase of partnership at will, in light of reasoning contained in para\n5 referred hereinabove in para 4.5 one cannot go to arbitration and\nafter elevating to Supreme Court, Justice Ahmadi as a Chief Justice,\nis alleged to have taken the view that even in the partnership at\nwill one can go to arbitration is practically not acceptable.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_41\">When\nthis judgment of  Prabhu shankar <a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_116\">Jaiswal</a>(supra) states that in the\ncontext of <a href=\"/doc/797638/\" id=\"a_117\">section 69</a>, the issue can be referred to arbitration for\ndissolution under <a href=\"/doc/1336935/\" id=\"a_118\">section 69\n(3)(a)</a> of the Act is the general statement in the case of partnership\nfirm being unregistered one and one can go for arbitration.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1376863\" id=\"span_42\">They\nhave submitted that one can go for dissolution of the firm under any\nof the provisions of the Act as provided\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1647289/\" id=\"a_119\">section 44</a> of the Act but while delivering the judgment,\nJustice Ahmadi in <a href=\"/doc/1376863/\" id=\"a_120\">Manibhai Shankerbhai Patel</a> (supra)\n(1982 (1) GLR 312) was\nprecisely on the issue that if there is a partnership at will, one\nhas statutory right to dissolve the firm and then if one wants to\ninterpret the clause for arbitration that arbitration cannot take\naway the statutory right.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_43\">Learned senior Advocates for the\npetitioners have then submitted that this judgment of  Prabhu\nshankar <a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_121\">Jaiswal</a> (supra) is\nat  a general proposition and at the same time consistent view of\nGujarat High Court  in three cases is that if the firm is a\npartnership at will, one cannot go to arbitrator.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_44\">Therefore, in my\nview, so far as the second part of the two judgments i.e.  Prabhu\nshankar <a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_122\">Jaiswal</a>(supra) as\nwell as Prem Lata (smt.)\n(supra) is concerned the\nissue with regard to dissolution can be referred to arbitrator but\nnot for the purpose of determining whether partnership is a\npartnership at will or not because the firm is not registered.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_45\">Thus,\nin my view, the two judgments i.e.   Prabhu shankar <a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_123\">Jaiswal</a>(supra) as\nwell as Prem Lata (smt.)

When\nthere is dispute whether this partnership firm is a partnership at\nwill or otherwise, the same is not referable to the arbitration\nbecause the firm is unregistered.  The decision in Prem\nLata (smt.) (supra) was\ndelivered by the Hon ble Supreme Court by Justice K. Ramasway and\nSujata V.

Referring to para 7 of the\ndecision reported in M/s.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"467277\" id=\"span_53\"><a href=\"/doc/467277/\" id=\"a_136\">Krishna Motor Service</a> (supra),\nit is laid down therein that whether you have any right or not, that\npart would not fall under exceptions engrafted in clause (a) of\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/797638/\" id=\"a_137\">section 69</a> of the Act, but if one has the right\nand if one wants to enforce that  right, the said issue can be\nbrought to the notice even if the partnership was not registered.  If\nthe respondents raise the issue that the petitioners have no right to\nseek dissolution then that issue is different from <a href=\"/doc/1336935/\" id=\"a_138\">section 69(3)(a)</a>\nof the Act. When the respondents contended that this firm is not\npartnership at will, then it\ngoes to the very right to claim dissolution. If somebody has to\ndecide whether the petitioners have right to dissolve the firm, that\nissue does not fall under <a href=\"/doc/1336935/\" id=\"a_139\">section 69(3)(a)</a> of the Act. Thus, it is\nclear that if the said issue does not fall under\n<a href=\"/doc/1336935/\" id=\"a_140\">section 69(3)(a)</a> of the Act, that issue cannot be referred to the\narbitration if the firm is not registered. If we take it differently,\nthe moment the respondent raise the plea that this firm is not\npartnership at will,  the issue to be decided between the parties is\nwhether the firm dated 27.7.1999 is partnership at will, or not and\naccordingly this matter falls in first part of sub section (3) of\n<a href=\"/doc/797638/\" id=\"a_141\">section 69</a> of the Act and not in three exceptions under <a href=\"/doc/1336935/\" id=\"a_142\">section\n69(3)(a)</a> of the Act because this is the dispute arisen out of the\ncontract.  Whether this firm is a partnership at will or not is a\nmatter of interpretation of the contract itself. Once it is a matter\nof interpretation of contract, it can be referred to arbitration for\naccounts and release of the properties of the firm and not for\ndissolution of the partnership because the firm is not registered. \nLearned senior Advocates for the petitioners have also submitted that\nlet the respondents make a statement that they are not disputing\ndissolution, then the petitioners are ready to go for arbitration for\naccounts and for release of properties of the firm.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"467277\" id=\"span_54\">In short,\nconsidering the decision in the case of M/s.\n<a href=\"/doc/467277/\" id=\"a_143\">Krishna Motor Service</a>\n(supra) it appears that\nif the respondents are raising the plea that this firm is not\npartnership at will, then that issue cannot go to arbitration because\nit is unregistered firm.  It is important to note that this finding\nof the Supreme Court is not watered\ndown in any judgment and in my view, it is not the passing\nobservation and the same is binding to this court and if at all it is\nobiter dictum, then\nalso the same is  of the Supreme Court.</span>\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1986999\" id=\"span_55\">10.\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocate for the respondents has then relied on a case in\n<a href=\"/doc/1986999/\" id=\"a_144\">Kalpana Kothari (smt) vs.\nSudha Yadav</a> (smt) and Ors [(2002) 1 SCC 203]. In\nthis judgment,\n the differences between the old Act, 1940 and the new Act 1996 of\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_145\">Arbitration Act</a> is highlighted.  <a href=\"/doc/478274/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 34</a> of 1940  Act contemplates\nfor stay of the proceedings and new Act 1996 which is not\ncontemplated stay of proceedings.  The moment the application under\n<a href=\"/doc/671279/\" id=\"a_147\">section 8</a> is filed, the suit goes to arbitration. In fact, the suit\nwas filed for dissolution of partnership under <a href=\"/doc/1647289/\" id=\"a_148\">section 44</a> of the Act\nwhich would not be the case under <a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_149\">section 43</a> of the Act in case of\npartnership at will or unregistered firm and  thus in my view, this\ndecision will not render any help to the respondents.</span>\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"666427\" id=\"span_56\">10.1\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocate for the respondents has then relied on <a href=\"/doc/666427/\" id=\"a_150\">V.H.\nPatel &amp; Company &amp; Ors vs. Hirubhai Himabhai\nPatel &amp; Ors</a> [(2000) 4 SCC 368]. This judgment is\nnot reference under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_151\">section 8</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996.  Only on consent terms the arbitrator was appointed and\nthe appeal was disposed of on consent terms.  Moreover, the \narbitration clause in this case is in para 9.  It is reproduction of\nclause 11 and it speaks about disputes between the parties.\nArbitration  clause 17 of the case on hand i.e. the instant case\nnarrated in para 2 hereinabove which speaks about partner and not\nparties.  The distinction is that if it is arbitration in such a\nmanner, if the partnership is dissolved, then agreement will be\nfollowed and then it is dispute between various parties. The\npartnership is not dissolved because it is the dispute between the\npartners.  Thus, this judgment has no relevance with the present\ncase.</span>\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1703962\" id=\"span_57\">10.2\t\tLearned\nsenior Advocate for the respondents has also relied on  <a href=\"/doc/1703962/\" id=\"a_152\">P.

In this case, during the pendency of the appeal, all\nthe parties have entered into arbitration agreement and they have\nagreed to refer the dispute in this appeal to Justice S. Ranganath\nMisra, a Retired Judge of the Supreme Court as the sole arbitrator\nand the question which had arisen for consideration was whether the\nSupreme Court in appeal, can refer  the parties to arbitration under\nthe new Act. Under the circumstances, the Supreme Court was \nsatisfied and observed that arbitration agreement in form of an\napplication covers all the disputes between the parties even more\nthan that and  it is observed that language of <a href=\"/doc/671279/\" id=\"a_153\">section 8</a> is\nperemptory and it is obligatory for the court to refer the parties to\narbitration in terms of their agreement.  Thus, as discussed\nhereinabove, the said fact of this judgment has no relevance with the\npresent case.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1488233\" id=\"span_58\">10.3\t\tLearned\n Advocate for the respondents has also placed reliance on unreported\njudgment dated 18.12.2012 delivered by this court in Special Civil\nApplication No. 5158 of 2011 and submitted that in the above referred\nunreported judgment, it was a partnership suit and the decision of\nthis court in the case of  <a href=\"/doc/1488233/\" id=\"a_154\">Mohanlal\nSajandas &amp; Anr. v.

The dispute is for recovery of\ncertain amount and the issue is with regard to settlement of accounts\nand the issue with regard to dissolution of the firm was not at all\nthere because as referred in para 10, it is an admitted fact that the\npartnership has already come to an end and dissolved and the issue\nwas related to refer the same related to accounts to be referred to\narbitration\nand not for dissolution.  Under the circumstances, in my view, this\ndecision has no relevance with the dispute involved in the present\ncase so it will not render any help to the respondents.</span>\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1600940\" id=\"span_61\">11.\t\tConsidering\nthe above referred discussions made by this court and considering the\nfact of the case of <a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_155\">Prabhu Shankar Jaiswal</a> (supra) and the\nultimate ratio derived by the Hon ble Supreme Court,  I am of the\nview that the ratio of the said case is not applicable to the present\nsubject matter as discussed hereinabove and I am of the view that the\ntrial court has miserably failed in coming to the conclusion that the\nsubject matter in dispute is covered by the judgment reported in \n<a href=\"/doc/1600940/\" id=\"a_156\">Prabhu Shankar Jaiswal</a> (supra).  As per the case of the\npetitioners, the partnership is partnership at will, and as per\nclause 9 of the partnership deed and, in light of the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1418571/\" id=\"a_157\">section 43</a> of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the firm shall stand\ndissolved on issuance of notice. As discussed hereinabove, the\nrespondents have disputed the dissolution. Thus, I am of the view\nthat when the dissolution itself is in dispute, the matter  cannot be\nreferred to the arbitrator as the firm is unregistered and in view of\nthe same, these Special Civil Applications are allowed and the\nimpugned order dated 30.1.2013 passed below Exhs. 18 and 21 in Civil\nSuit No.2813/2012 and  Civil Suit No. 2814 of 2012 and the order\ndated  30.1.2013 passed below Exhs. 17 and 20 in Civil Suit No. 2815\nof 2012  are being illegal, unjust and against the settled principles\nof law and are liable to be set aside and are accordingly\nset aside.</span></span>\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">12.\t\tSo\nfar as the above referred Appeal from Orders are concerned, learned\nsenior Advocates for the petitioners have submitted that while\npassing order under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_158\">section 8</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996 below Exh. 18 and Exh. 21 dated 30.1.2013, the trial court \nhas not decided the Notice of Motion Exh. 6 and Injunction\nApplication No. 7 on merits and has committed error because in the\norder it was observed that the partnership is at will.  When the\ntrial court has referred the suit to arbitration, the court was duty\nbound to convert the suit as <a href=\"/doc/1410442/\" id=\"a_159\">section 9</a> application under the\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_160\">Arbitration and  Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and decide the <a href=\"/doc/1410442/\" id=\"a_161\">section 9</a>\napplication for the purpose of grant of interim relief.  Learned\nAdvocate for the respondents has argued that unless the petitioners\nagreed to the suit being referred to arbitration, the  question of\nconverting the suit under <a href=\"/doc/1410442/\" id=\"a_162\">section  9</a> would not arise.  So far as the\nNotice of Motion Exh.6 and injunction application Exh. 7 is\nconcerned, the trial court has come to the conclusion that as the\nmatter is referred to arbitrator, the said Hon ble Court has no\njurisdiction to decide the Notice of Motion and hence without going\ninto the merits of the said Notice of Motion, the same was rejected\nby order dated 30.1.2013.  As the Special Civil Applications\nchallenging the orders passed below Exhs. 18 and 21 in  Civil Suit\nNos. 2813 and 2814 of 2012 and the order dated  30.1.2013 passed\nbelow Exhs. 17 and 20 in Civil Suit No. 2815 of 2012 have been set\naside, the Appeal from Orders in turn deserves to be allowed and they\nare required to be remanded for fresh hearing. Hence without entering\ninto the merits of these Appeal from Orders, the same are allowed and\nthe order dated 30.1.2013 passed below Notice of Motion Exh. 6 and\ninjunction application Exh.7 are set aside and the trial court is\nordered to proceed further with fresh hearing of Exh. 6 and Exh. 7\nand rest of the applications if any and decide the same in accordance\nwith law and on its own merits and without being influenced by the\norder passed in the above referred Special Civil Applications. The\ninterim protection granted  by the trial court which was as such\nextended vide order dated  21.2.2013 passed in Appeal from Order No.\n63/2013 is hereby extended on the same terms and conditions till the\nNotice of Motion Exhs. 6 and 7 is heard afresh as directed above and\ndispose of the same on merits.
