The Respondent had clearly\n                               made a distinction between his privity of contract with the Appellant as\n                               against that of Appellant with the APO. The liability was projected\n                               only against the Appellant in the contract and not against APO, thus, it\n                               could not be said that non-joinder of APO as a party was fatal to the\n                               case of the Respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">                          15.

Thus, it held\n                               that the Appellant was not able to prove that the suit of the Respondent\n                               was bereft of any cause of action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">                          16.

The Appellant failed to clarify/prove how this stipulation\n                               carries a meaning/interpretation contrary to its plain meaning. The\n                               Appellant nowhere claimed that the Respondent failed to honor his\n                               obligations under the Purchase Order. The agreement between the\n                               parties is void only if both parties are under a mistake as to matter of\n                               fact.

At the outset, the Appellant has explained the nature of DAIRV. It is\n                               the acknowledgment by APO to a firm who delivers any commodity to\n                               APO that all the norms/rules as cited in the APO tenders were followed\n                               while making the delivery. It is stated that if these rules are not\n                               followed, an Army Depot will not issue a DAIRV receipt. It is further\n                               stated that no DAIRV receipt was produced by the Respondent before\n                               the Court, as APO never issued the same, as the Respondent has\n                               admittedly breached the norm/rule relating to expenditure on transport\n                               by allegedly paying the transporters above the ceiling fixed by the\n                               APO.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">                          21. On Issue No. 1: Learned ADJ has failed to appreciate that APO is a\n                               necessary party as the Respondent has agreed to be paid as per the\n                               norms and receipts issued by the APO, hence it is the norms of APO\n                               which are directly and substantially in issue in the suit. Respondent&#x27;s\n                               contention that there is no direct contact between the Respondent and\n                               APO is misconceived as the Respondent directly supplied Gram\n                               Crushed to APO. A) The Respondent, as per Clause 6 of the Purchase\n                               Order dated 07.01.2008, was required to submit duly acknowledged\n                               DAIRV within 7 days, only then could it claim 95% of the payment\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Digitally Signed          RFA 344/2021                                                     Page 7 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">By:AMIT ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Signing Date:13.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">15:05:59</span>\n                                from the Appellant. The same was not submitted by the Respondent.\n                               Since DAIRV issued by APO is essential to the dispute, APO must be\n                               impleaded as a party. B) The Respondent, as per Clause 6 of the\n                               Acceptance dated 07.01.2008, had an obligation to pursue Appellant&#x27;s\n                               Claim with APO. C) Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_3\">Order I Rule 9 of the Code of Civil\n                               Procedure</a>, 1908 (&quot;<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">CPC</a>&quot;) becomes applicable, as Clause 7 of the\n                               Purchase Order dated 07.01.2008 mandates that the Respondent will\n                               get payment from the Appellant when the Appellant receives its\n                               payment from APO.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">                          22.

The original contract is the offer\n                               dated 22.08.2007 and the Appellant&#x27;s letter dated 07.01.2008 is mere\n                               acceptance of it. B) Respondent failed to submit any DAIRV receipt,\n                               which was required as per the contract, thus it is not entitled to any\n                               payment from the Appellant and no cause of action arose in favor of\n                               the Respondent for any payment. C) The Respondent, as per its own\n                               offer letter dated 31.12.2007, has agreed to be paid as per terms and\n                               conditions of the previous offer i.e. as per DAIRV norms or actual\n                               basis, whichever is less. The Appellant has admittedly already paid\n                               transportation charges as per the DAIRV norms thus there is no cause\n                               of action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">                          23.

B) In the offer letter dated\n                               31.12.2007, the Respondent has stated that Terms and Conditions of\n                               the new order will be same as per the previous order, in which the\n                               Respondent raised bill as per the DAIRV norms. Thus, the parties were\n                               ad idem about lesser transportation charges, and the Respondent is\n                               taking undue advantage of a clerical error (omission to include\n                               reference to APO norms in transportation charges) to claim higher\n                               transportation charges. C) All other terms of the Purchase Order clearly\n                               show that standards as per APO requirements were to be followed.\n                               Hence, Clause 4 was purely a clerical error. D) DAIRV norms are\n                               fundamental to the Contract with any organisation, Appellant&#x27;s or\n                               APO&#x27;s tender is only awarded to those firms who are willing to supply\n                               commodities     to   the   APO    within   standard/ceiling    prices.       E)\n                               Respondent&#x27;s contention that any price can be paid is contrary to <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_5\">Indian\n                               Contract Act, 1872</a> and will lead to absurdity. F) The learned ADJ has\n                               failed to correctly apply the law. G) The learned ADJ failed to consider\n                               that the conduct of the Appellant is bona fide, as it has released all dues\n                               of the Respondent including transportation charges, and it is only the\n                               differential amount in dispute. H) The Respondent has not produced its\n                               Offer Letter dated 31.12.2007 or any DAIRV receipts from the APO,\n                               which creates an adverse presumption against the Respondent which\n                               the learned ADJ failed to draw. I) The learned ADJ failed to apply the\n                               standard test of any prudent and reasonable man while accepting an\n                               offer i.e. the Appellant would not take up the liability to pay more\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Digitally Signed          RFA 344/2021                                                       Page 9 of 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">By:AMIT ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signing Date:13.12.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">15:05:59</span>\n                                when the Respondent is willing to be paid less as per DAIRV norms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">                          24.

B) The bills are forged,\n                               fabricated and fraudulent, for which the learned counsel relies upon the\n                               testimony of PW2 and PW3. C) The witnesses of the Respondent are\n                               interested witnesses, and the Respondent is involved in unjust\n                               enrichment, the receipts are made pursuant to collusion between the\n                               Respondent and commission agents. D) No transporter was examined\n                               by the Respondent to prove the transport bills, which are the basis of\n                               the Respondent&#x27;s claims. E) The receipts issued by transporters were\n                               unstamped and hence inadmissible.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                          25.

The Purchase Order is an\n                               admitted document by both parties. The transportation bills were also\n                               proved and no material contradiction has come out from cross-\n                               examination of the Respondent&#x27;s witnesses. B) The Appellant has\n                               produced no documents/witnesses to disprove the bills/prove that they\n                               were inflated. The Respondent&#x27;s witnesses were also not cross-\n                               examined on the above-stated facts, hence the statements as stated by\n                               the witnesses are deemed to be admitted by the Appellant. C) DW-1\n                               did not place any document on record to prove that in similar purchase\n                               orders awarded to other parties, the impugned clause was customarily\n                               understood to include &quot;as per DAIRV norms&quot;. D) The Appellant\n                               cannot plead new facts in the appeal, i.e. that the Respondent raised\n                               false bills, which were not brought before the Trial Court. E) The\n                               Appellant relies on minor contradictions of the Respondent&#x27;s witnesses.\n                               Relying upon judicial precedents, it is argued that depositions have to\n                               be taken as a whole and minor inconsistencies which do not affect the\n                               main substance of the case are to be taken in correct perspective along\n                               with other evidences. Thus, the Respondent has proved that he is\n                               entitled to receive Rs. 29,46,405.63/- from the Appellant towards\n                               transportation charges.

What\n                                         makes a person a necessary party is not merely that he has\n                                         relevant evidence to give on some of the questions involved;\n                                         that would only make him a necessary witness. It is not\n                                         merely that he has an interest in the correct solution of some\n                                         question involved and has thought of relevant arguments to\n                                         advance. The only reason which makes it necessary to make a\n                                         person a party to an action is so that he should be bound by\n                                         the result of the action and the question to be settled,\n                                         therefore, must be a question in the action which cannot be\n                                         effectually and completely settled unless he is a party. The line\n                                         has been drawn on a wider construction of the rule between the\n                                         direct interest or the legal interest and commercial interest. It\n                                         is, therefore, necessary that the person must be directly or\n                                         legally interested in the action in the answer, i.e., he can say\n                                         that the litigation may lead to a result which will affect him\n                                         legally that is by curtailing his legal rights. It is difficult to say\n                                         that the rule contemplates joining as a defendant a person\n                                         whose only object is to prosecute his own cause of action.\n                                         Similar provision was considered in Amon v.
