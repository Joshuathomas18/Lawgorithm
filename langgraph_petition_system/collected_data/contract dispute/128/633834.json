It is engaged, \ninter alia, in the business of manufacturing and marketing of iron and steel \nproducts. The Respondent is a partnership firm.  It is engaged in the business \nof consignment agents. It has its office at Jalandhar.  A contract was entered \ninto by and between the parties hereto in regard to the handling and storage \nof iron and steel materials of the Appellant at Ludhiana.  The Appellants \ncontend that one Shri Anil Verma, Partner of the Respondent-Firm had \nconstituted various firms and companies and obtained several consignment \nagency contracts from the Appellant pertaining to Delhi,  Faridabad, \nChandigarh and Ludhiana etc. who conspired with certain officials of the \nAppellants  and obtained payments @ Rs.140/- per M.T. in place of Rs.36/- \nper M.T. on a false plea that the Transport Union at Bahadurgarh did not \npermit transportation of goods without levy of a fee of Rs.100/- per M.T. on \ntransportation of such goods.  An investigation was conducted by the Central \nBureau of Investigation and a criminal case was initiated against Shri Anil \nVerma and the concerned officials of the Appellants.  Allegedly, with the \nobject of presenting a clean image to the Appellants and with a view to \navoid termination of all the contracts by them, a  plea was put forth  that Shri \nAnil Verma had resigned from the partnership firm as also from his other \nfirms/companies.  According to the Appellants, the said Shri Anil Verma \nwas replaced by his family members as a partner of the said firm but he \ncontinued to be in complete control over the firms/companies. The contract \nof the Respondent was terminated by the Appellants on 23.05.2002.  On the \nsame day, a show cause notice was also issued to Shri Anil Verma as to why \nhe and his firms/companies should not be black listed.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">The Respondent-Firm, however, filed a suit being Suit No.122 of \n2002 for grant of permanent injunction restraining the Appellants herein \nfrom in any manner blacklisting the Respondent-Firm or terminating the \nconsignment agency contract.  On an application for injunction having been \nfiled, the Civil Judge, Junior Division, directed the parties to maintain status \nquo in regard to the status of the Respondent-Plaintiff herein qua termination \nof the contract as also the order of  blacklisting.  The Appellants appeared to \nhave sought for time to file written statement.  They also filed a rejoinder to \nthe counter affidavit to the application for injunction wherein it took a \nspecific plea that the subject-matter of the suit being covered by the \narbitration agreement entered into by and between the parties, it was not \nmaintainable. On 07.06.2002, they filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 8</a> of \nthe 1996 Act,  which was rejected by the Civil Judge, Junior Division by an \norder dated 03.10.2002, holding :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;The applicants/defendants have already filed a \nreply to application u/o 39 Rules 1 and 2 read with <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_3\">Section \n151</a> CPC and sought 15 days time to file written statement \nclearly proves that the process of the suit has already \nbegun and the defendants have already entered into a \ndefence of the suit meaning thereby they have subjected \nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.  The \ndefendants have not spelt out as to what is the dispute or \ndifference between the parties.  Rather, they have \nstraightaway black listed the plaintiff firm, without giving \nthem any notice regarding any dispute or difference, which \nwas mandatory.  From the perusal of the record, it is very \nmuch clear that there is no dispute or difference between \nthe present firm and the company with regard to any of the \ntransactions in the business between both of them.  Rather, \nthe company is at a dispute with a person, who no more \nexists as a partner in the plaintiff firm.  The company also \nwrote appreciation letter to the Plaintiff firm for their \ncooperation for achieving the desired targets for the year \n2001-02.  The same was made possible because of untiring \nefforts made by the plaintiff of the present case.  In the \npresent case, the straightaway of black listing the firm is \nnot justified, even the principal of natural justice goes in \nfavour of the respondent/plaintiff\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_2\">A Revision Application filed by the Appellants before the High Court \nthereagainst  was dismissed by the impugned judgment, inter alia, on the \npremise that the application filed by them  being not accompanied by the \noriginal arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof, the same was \nnot maintainable.

It has \nembodied the relevant rules of the modern law but does not contain all the \nprovisions thereof.  The 1996 Act, however, is not as extensive as the \n<a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_13\">English Arbitration Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">\tThe 1996 Act was enacted by the Parliament in the light of the \nUNCITRAL Model Rules.  In certain respects, the Parliament of India while \nenacting the said Act has gone beyond the scope of the said Rules.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">With a view to appreciate the said question, we may at the outset \nnotice the provisions of Section 4 of the English Arbitration Act, 1899, \nwhich was bodily lifted in enacting <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a> of the 1940 Act,  in the \nfollowing terms :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;4.

The Indian Parliament has gone beyond the recommendations made \nby the UNCITRAL Model Rules in enacting <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections  8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_26\">16</a> of the 1996 \nAct. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections  8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_28\">16</a> of the 1996 Act may be \ncompared with <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 45</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1573006/\" id=\"a_30\">54</a> thereof.  <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 45</a> deals with New York \nConvention, whereas <a href=\"/doc/1573006/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 54</a> deals with Geneva Convention Awards.  \nThe difference can be immediately noticed.  Whereas under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections 45</a> and  \n<a href=\"/doc/1573006/\" id=\"a_34\">54</a>, the Court exercises its supervisory jurisdiction in relation to arbitration \nproceedings, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 16</a> of the 1996 Act, the arbitrator is entitled \nto determine his own jurisdiction.  We, however, do not mean to suggest that \nPart II of the 1996 Act does not contemplate determination of his own \njurisdiction by the arbitral tribunal as we are not called upon to determine \nthe said question.  We have referred to the aforementioned provisions only \nfor the purpose of comparing  the difference in the language used by the \nIndian Parliament while dealing with the domestic arbitration vis-`-vis the \nInternational arbitration.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 8</a> confers a power on the judicial authority.

Darwins Ltd. [(1942) 1 All ER 337]  and it was stated :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">&quot;The answer to the question whether a dispute falls \nwithin an arbitration clause in a contract must depend on \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">(a) what is the dispute, and (b) what disputes the \narbitration clause covers.  To take (b) first, the language \nof the arbitration clause in this agreement is as broad as \ncan well be imagined.  It embraces any dispute between \nthe parties &quot;in respect of &quot; the agreement or in respect of \nany provision in the agreement or in respect of anything \narising out of it.  If the parties are at one on the point that \nthey did enter into a binding agreement in terms which \nare not in dispute, and the difference that has arisen \nbetween them is as to their respective rights under the \nadmitted agreement in the events that have hampered \u0016 \ne.g. as to whether the agreement has been broken by \neither of them; or as to the damage resulting from such \nbreach; or as to whether the breach by one of them goes \nto the root of the contract and entitles the other party to \nclaim to be discharged from further performance; or as to \nwhether  events supervening since the agreement was \nmade have brought  the contract to an end so that neither \nparty is required to perform further \u0016 in all such cases it \nseems to me that the difference is within such an \narbitration clause as this.  In view, however, of phrases to \nbe found in the report of some earlier decisions, the \navailability of the arbitration clause when &quot;frustration&quot; is \nalleged to have occurred will require closer \nconsideration.&quot;           \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">In the instant case, the existence of a valid agreement stands admitted. \nThere cannot also be any dispute that the matter relating to termination of \nthe contract would be a dispute arising out of a contract and, thus, the \narbitration agreement contained in clause 44 of the contract would be \nsquarely attracted.  Once the conditions precedent contained in the said \nproceedings are satisfied, the judicial authority is statutorily mandated to \nrefer the matter to arbitration.  What is necessary to be looked into therefor, \ninter alia, would be as to whether the subject-matter of the dispute is covered \nby the arbitration agreement or not. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\"><a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 34</a> of the repealed 1940 Act employs the expression &#x27;steps in \nthe proceedings&#x27;.  Only in terms of <a href=\"/doc/157537/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 21</a> of the 1940 Act, the dispute \ncould be referred to arbitration provided parties thereto agreed.  Under the \n1940 Act, the suit was not barred.  The Court would not automatically refer \nthe dispute to an arbitral tribunal. In the event, it having arrived at \nsatisfaction that there is no sufficient reason that the dispute should not be  \nreferred and no step in relation thereto was taken by the applicant, it could \nstay the suit.           \t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1703962\" id=\"span_1\"><a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act contemplates some  departure from <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_41\">Section \n34</a> of the 1940 Act.  Whereas <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 34</a> of the 1940 Act contemplated stay \nof the suit; <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act mandates a reference.  Exercise of  \ndiscretion by the judicial authority, which was the hallmark of <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 34</a> of \nthe 1940 Act,  has been taken away under the 1996 Act.  The direction to \nmake reference is not only mandatory, but the arbitration proceedings to be \ncommenced or continued and conclusion thereof by an arbitral award remain \nunhampered by such pendency.

Malhotra&#x27;s  &#x27;The Law and \nPractice of Arbitration and Conciliation&#x27;, 2nd Edition, pp. 346-347]      \n\nScope of the said provision fell for consideration before a Division \nBench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1703962/\" id=\"a_45\">P. Anand Gajapathi Raju and Others v. P.V.G.  Raju \n(Dead) and Others</a> [(2000) 4 SCC 539], wherein this Court held :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">&quot;In the matter before us, the arbitration agreement \ncovers all the disputes between the parties in the \nproceedings before us and even more than that. As \nalready noted, the arbitration agreement satisfies the \nrequirements of <a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 7</a> of the new Act. The language \nof <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 8</a> is peremptory. It is, therefore, obligatory for \nthe Court to refer the parties to arbitration in terms  of \ntheir arbitration agreement. Nothing remains to be \ndecided in the original action or the appeal arising \ntherefrom. There is no question of stay of the \nproceedings till the arbitration proceedings conclude and \nthe award becomes final in terms of the provisions of the \nnew Act. All the rights, obligations and remedies of the \nparties would now be governed by the new Act including \nthe right to challenge the award.

We are of \nthe view that the High Court did not properly appreciate \nthe relevant and respective scope, object and purpose as \nalso the considerations necessary for dealing with and \ndisposing of the respective applications envisaged under \n<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 34</a> of the 1940 Act and <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 \nAct. <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 34</a> of the 1940 Act provided for filing an \napplication to stay legal proceedings instituted by any \nparty to an arbitration agreement against any other party \nto such agreement, in derogation of the arbitration clause \nand attempts for settlement of disputes otherwise than in \naccordance with the arbitration clause by substantiating \nthe existence of an arbitration clause and the judicial \nauthority concerned may stay such proceedings on being \nsatisfied that there is no sufficient reason as to why the \nmatter should not be referred to for decision in \naccordance with the arbitration agreement, and that the \napplicant seeking for stay was at the time when the \nproceedings were commenced and still remained ready \nand willing to do all things necessary to the proper \nconduct of the arbitration. This provision under the 1940 \nAct had nothing to do with actual reference to the \narbitration of the disputes and that was left to be taken \ncare of under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_59\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_60\">20</a> of the 1940 Act. In \nstriking contrast to the said scheme underlying the \nprovisions of the 1940 Act, in the new 1996 Act, there is \nno provision corresponding to <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 34</a> of the old Act \nand <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act mandates that the judicial \nauthority before which an action has been brought in \nrespect of a matter, which is the subject-matter of an \narbitration agreement, shall refer the parties to arbitration \nif a party to such an agreement applies not later than \nwhen submitting his first statement. The provisions of the \n1996 Act do not envisage the specific obtaining of any \nstay as under the 1940 Act, for the reason that not only \nthe direction to make reference is mandatory but \nnotwithstanding the pendency of the proceedings before \nthe judicial authority or the making of an application \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 8(1)</a> of the 1996 Act, the arbitration \nproceedings are enabled, under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 8(3)</a> of the 1996 \nAct to be commenced or continued and an arbitral award \nalso made unhampered by such pendency.

It \nposed unto itself wrong question.  It refused to interfere in the matter \nopining that no notice had been served by the Chairman of the First \nAppellant in terms of the arbitration agreement. For maintaining an \napplication under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act, service of notice under the \narbitration agreement was not mandatory.  The said stage was yet to be \nreached.   What was necessary was existence of an arbitration agreement.  \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">So far as the question of blacklisting is concerned, an error was \ncommitted by the High Court in opining that the Respondent-Firm had been \nblacklisted without issuing any notice.  In fact, from a perusal of the notice \ndated 23.05.2002, it appears, upon recital of the relevant facts, it was stated :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">&quot;6.\tIn view of the above, before taking a final decision \non black listing you and debarring you from participating \nin tenders floated by RINL, VSP or entering into any \nagreement with RINL, VSP, you are hereby calling upon \nto explain as to why you should not be black listed and \ndebarred as mentioned above.

The basic question  was \nwhether there had been breaches of contract on the part of the Respondents. \nThe contention of the Respondent before the trial court had been that the \norder of blacklisting had arisen from the terms of the contract itself, as \nwould appear from the following averments :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">&quot;14.\tThat the plaintiff have learnt that the defendants \nwithout following the basic principles of natural justice \nare intending to terminate the consignment agency \ncontract of the plaintiff and to blacklist the plaintiff on \nalleged ground that one of Ex-partner of the plaintiff is \nclaimed to be guilty of misrepresentation of overcharging \nthe freight by misrepresentation from the different \ncompany.  Anyhow this is no ground to do so.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\tThe principal grievance of the Plaintiff-Respondent was the action on \nthe part of the Appellants terminating the contract.  Grounds on which the \norder of termination were based, had been questioned in the plaint.  Such \ncontentions could well be raised before the Arbitrator.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">\tShri Anil Verma was also acting on behalf of the partnership firm.  It \nhas not been found that he had no authority to represent the firm.

They in effect and substance  questioned the \njurisdiction of the court in proceeding with the matter.  In fact, in its \napplication filed under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act, the Appellant raised a \ncontention that the suit was liable to be dismissed and the order of injunction \nvacated in view of the arbitration clause.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1076013\" id=\"span_4\">This aspect of the matter was considered by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1076013/\" id=\"a_71\">Food \nCorporation of India &amp; Anr. v. Yadav Enginner &amp; Contractor</a> [1983 (1) SCR \n95].  Therein this Court opined that interlocutory proceedings are only \nincidental proceedings to the main proceedings and, thus, any step taken in \nthe interlocutory proceedings does not come within the purview of main \nproceedings, stating :</span> \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">&quot;\u0005When ex parte orders are made at the back of the party \nthe other party is forced to come to the court to vindicate \nits right. Such compulsion cannot disclose an unambiguous \nintention to give up the benefit of the arbitration \nagreement. Therefore, taking any other steps in the \nproceedings must be confined to taking steps in the \nproceedings for resolution of the substantial dispute in the \nsuit. Appearing and contesting the interlocutory \napplications by seeking either vacation thereof or \nmodification thereof cannot be said to be displaying an \nunambiguous intention to acquiesce in the suit and to \nwaive the benefit of the arbitration agreement. Any other \nview would both be harsh and inequitous and contrary to \nthe underlying intendment of the Act. The first party which \napproaches the court and seeks an ex parte interim order \nhas obviously come to the court in breach of the arbitration \nagreement. By obtaining an ex parte order if it forces the \nother party to the agreement to suffer the order, or by \nmerely contesting be imputed the intention of waiving the \nbenefit of arbitration agreement, it would enjoy an \nundeserved advantage. Such could not be the underlying \npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 34</a>. Therefore, in our opinion, to \neffectuate the purpose underlying <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 34</a> the narrow \nconstruction of the expression &quot;taking any other steps in \nthe proceedings&quot; as hereinabove set out appears to advance \nthe object and purpose underlying <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 34</a> and the \npurpose for which the Act was enacted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\tThe expression &#x27;first statement on the substance of the dispute&#x27; \ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 8(1)</a> of the 1996 Act must be contra-distinguished with \nthe expression  &#x27;written statement&#x27;.  It employs submission of the party to \nthe jurisdiction of the judicial authority.  What is, therefore, is needed is a \nfinding on the part of the judicial authority that the party  has waived his \nright to invoke the arbitration clause.  If an application is filed before \nactually filing the first statement on the substance of the dispute, in our \nopinion, the party cannot be said to have waived his right or acquiesced \nhimself to the jurisdiction of the court.  What is, therefore, material is as to \nwhether the petitioner has filed his first statement on the substance of the \ndispute or not, if not, his application under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act, may \nnot be held wholly  unmaintainable.

While doing so, they \nraised a specific plea of bar of the suit in view of the existence of an \narbitration agreement.

What was necessary was to consider the substance of the \ndispute.  Once it is found that the dispute between the parties arose out of the \ncontract, <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act would be attracted.   \nFurthermore, as noticed hereinbefore, the High Court committed a \nmanifest error in holding  that the Respondent-Firm had been blacklisted \nwithout any notice  as only a notice to show cause in that behalf had been \nissued.  A final decision in regard to  blacklisting of the Respondent-Firm \nwas yet to be taken.

In our view, it would be \ndifficult to give an interpretation to <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 8</a> under \nwhich bifurcation of the cause of action, that is to say, the \nsubject-matter of the suit or in some cases bifurcation of \nthe suit between parties who are parties to the arbitration \nagreement and others is possible. This would be laying \ndown a totally new procedure not contemplated under the \nAct. If bifurcation of the subject-matter of a suit was \ncontemplated, the legislature would have used \nappropriate language to permit such a course. Since there \nis no such indication in the language, it follows that \nbifurcation of the subject-matter of an action brought \nbefore a judicial authority is not allowed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">Secondly, such bifurcation of suit in two parts, one to \nbe decided by the Arbitral Tribunal and the other to be \ndecided by the civil court would inevitably delay the \nproceedings. The whole purpose of speedy disposal of \ndispute and decreasing the cost of litigation would be \nfrustrated by such procedure.

The said \ndecision has no application in the instant case as a finding of fact was \narrived at therein that the Union of India had withheld payment of a large \nsum of money on the specious plea that some amount in relation to another \ncontract was due to it.  The submission of the respondent therein was that no \nsuch contract had been executed by it.

The Union accepted liability to pay the amount \nclaimed by the Company in the suit. The Union still \ndeclined to pay the amount asserting that an amount was \ndue from the Company to the Union under a distinct \ncontract. This amount was not sought to be set-off under \nany term of the contract under which the Company made \nthe claim. The dispute raised by the Union was therefore \nnot in respect of the liability under the terms of the \ncontract which included the arbitration clause, but in \nrespect of an alleged liability of the Company under \nanother contract which it may be noted had already been \nreferred to arbitration. The Union had no defence to the \naction filed by the Company : it was not contended that \nthe amount of Rs. 10,625/- was not due to the Company \nunder the contract relied upon by the Company. For \nenforcement of the arbitration clause there must exist a \ndispute : in the absence of a dispute between the parties \nto the arbitration agreement, there can be no reference.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">Such is not the case here.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the application \nfiled by the Appellants under <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 8</a> of the 1996 Act was maintainable. \nBefore parting with the case, we may notice a disturbing state of \naffairs.
