They\nhave not received any payment for work executed beyond the\nBOQ quantity which had affected the cash flow of the project.\nDue to non timely payment of R. A. Bills and non­payment of\nprice variation, not only the progress of work affected very badly\nwhich was brought to the notice of the department from time to\ntime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">2.2          As per the say of the petitioner the drawings, details\nand decisions were given in piecemeal within the stipulated\nperiod of 18 months, even thereafter many details were not\nfinalized and in spite of various holds/hindrances, which were\ntotally beyond the control of petitioner, petitioner has been\nalways keeping the pace of work with expectations of department.\nThe extension was granted unilaterally upto 30th October 2014\ninstead of 31st March 2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">2.3            The factors considered by the department for\nextending the time limit upto 30th October 2014 was not known\nto the petitioner. However, there was delay of almost 7 months\nin submitting the request for extension of time on 1st July 2014.\nThe petitioner had requested for extension of time upto 30th April\n2015. Apart from providing sites in piecemeal, drawings, details,\nnon­payment of price various as per arrangement, the delay in\nbill payments and delay in extra excess item rates were the\nfactors for delaying the project. The petitioner submits that\nfinishing activities require more time in comparison with the\nactivities of frame work, the clearance for the same were given on\n29th July 2014 during the site visit of Executive Engineer which\nwas just before two days of expiry of stipulated period that too\nafter repeated requests and reminders. The petitioner submits\nthat simultaneous progress of work was hampered which was\nresulted delay in overall completion and in view of this, again the\npetitioner requested to extend the time limit upto 31st March\n2016 without any liquidated damages.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">2.4          The copy of the agreement was not supplied to the\npetitioner for quite some time.

The petitioner submits\nthat against Clause­30 it is mentioned that &quot;as Separate sheet\nattached(1) Disputes to be referred to Tribunal&quot;, however no\nseparate sheet is attached in the copy provided to the petitioner.\nAs the GUDA being local authority the disputes can&#x27;t be\nadjudicated by the Gujarat Public Works Contracts Arbitration\nTribunal as specified in the Clause­30 and the disputes are\nrequired to be adjudicated by domestic arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">2.5           Though all the works were completed on 31st March\n2016, the GUDA not recorded the completion of work. However,\nby notice dated 13th November 2017, the respondents were called\nupon for the time being to make the payment of above amounts\ntogether with interest @ 18% p.a. from the due date till its\nrealization OR appoint the Arbitrator to resolve the disputes\nbetween the parties within a period of 30 days from the date of\nreceipt of the notice. The petitioner submits that though the\nnotice is received by the respondents on 14th November 2017\nneither the requirements of the notice are complied with nor any\nreply is given.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">3.               Hence, the present petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">4.            Shri Chirag Sukhwani, learned counsel appearing\nfor the petitioner invited Court&#x27;s attention to the arbitration\nclause in the agreement at page no.91 in the compilation.\nClause­30 indicates that the dispute to be referred to tribunal as\nper separate sheet attached. Part of the clause­30 is scored off\nbut the title remains clearly indicating that the dispute is\nrequired to be referred to the arbitration. It is pertinent to note\nthat the tender document­contract starts from page no.74 in the\ncompilation and in that document clause­30 figures at page­91\nbearing the title the rest of the clause is scored off without any\nsignature. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the\nscoring off could be said to be only not applicable part as if the\nscored of clause is read then, it was in respect of referring the\ndispute to the Arbitration Tribunal, Gujarat State, which is in\nfact constituted under the provision of Gujarat Public Works\nContract Dispute Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992. The provisions\nof Section­2 of the Gujarat Public Works Contract Dispute\nArbitration Tribunal Act, 1992 confines the work contract as\ndefine in clause­K of Section­1 of Sub­section­2. The arbitration\ncontract means a contract between the State of Gujarat with any\nother person for execution of any of its work relating to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               Page 5 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">     C/IAAP/111/2018                                     ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nconstruction, work etc., as the State may by notification of\nOfficial Gazette specify. The respondent being a local authority\nand not notified as per the provisions of Public Works Contract\nDispute Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992, the disputes between the\npetitioner and the respondents were required to be adjudicated by\ndomestic arbitrator and it would not be covered by the disputes\nthat is to be adjudicated by arbitration under the tribunal as per\nthe Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_16\">5.            Learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the\ndecision rendered by the Supreme Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_2\">Om\nConstruction Co. Vs. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation</a> reported\nin (2009) 2 SCC 486 and submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_3\">the said decision</a> would\nclearly indicate that even if there is an arbitration clause and as\nper that clause, the arbitration tribunal is not available, the\nintention of the parties for referring to the arbitration cannot be\nruled­out. Hence, the Court in that matter referred the matter to\nthe arbitration. The following paragraphs from that decision\ndeserves to be set­out as under :­</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">6.     It appears that under General Conditions of Contract of\nthe Engineering Department of the Ahmedabad Municipal\nCorporation, under its General Specifications it is provided that\ncertain conditions are required to be followed which includes the\ncondition that Form B­I would be applicable to the contract and\nclause 30 of Form B­I is relevant for this case. The relevant\nportions of clause 30 of Form B­I reads as follows :­\n\n\n&quot;Clause 30(1) Disputes to be referred to Tribunal: The disputes\nrelating to this contract, so far as they relate to any of the\nfollowing matters, whether such disputes arise during the\nprogress of the work or after the completion or abandonment\nthereof, shall be referred to the Arbitration Tribunal, Gujarat\nState;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">(2) ...............\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">(3) The provision of <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_4\">Arbitration Act</a>, shall in so far as they are\ninconsistent with the provision of this Act, cease to apply to any\ndispute arising from a works contract and all arbitration\nproceedings in relation to such dispute before an Arbitrator,\nCourt or authority shall stand transferred to the Tribunal.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                           Page 6 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">       C/IAAP/111/2018                                    ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">7.     The appellant filed a petition before the Gujarat High\nCourt on 9th July, 2007, being Arbitration Petition No. 35 of\n2007, under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996, hereinafter referred to as &quot;the 1996 Act&quot;, inter alia,\npraying for the appointment of an Arbitrator to resolve the\ndisputes between the parties. The High Court by its order dated\n20th November, 2007, rejected the said petition. While doing so,\nthe High Court took note of <a href=\"/doc/99448369/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 2(1)(k)</a> of the Gujarat Public\nWorks Contracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal Act, 1992,\nhereinafter referred to as the &quot;<a href=\"/doc/134104933/\" id=\"a_7\">Gujarat Tribunal Act</a>&quot;, which\ndefines &quot;works contract&quot; to mean a contract made by the State\nGovernment or Public Undertaking which is notified in the\nOfficial Gazette by the State Government.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">8.     The High Court also noticed <a href=\"/doc/1561485/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 2(1)        (l)</a> of the\naforesaid Act, which defines &quot;Public Undertaking&quot; to, inter alia,\nmean such class of local authorities as the State Government\nspecifies by Notification in the Official Gazette. It was further\nnoticed that in the absence of such Notification, the Ahmedabad\nMunicipal Corporation was not a &quot;Public Undertaking&quot; and the\ncontract entered into by it with the appellant could not,\ntherefore, be termed as a &quot;Works Contract&quot; as defined in <a href=\"/doc/1561485/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n2(1)(k)</a> of the aforesaid Act. The High Court, therefore, held that\nthe Arbitration Tribunal, Gujarat State, would have no\njurisdiction to entertain the disputes between the parties\nemanating from the Work Order in question.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">9.      The High Court then went on to consider the applicability\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_10\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, to the facts of the\ncase. The High Court took note of the fact that the Agreement\nbetween the parties, and more particularly the Arbitration\nAgreement, did not lay down any procedure for appointing an\nArbitrator or Arbitrators. Accordingly, in the absence of such\nprocedure, the Designated Court could not invoke its jurisdiction\nunder Sub­section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act, which\ncontemplates a situation, where the appointment procedure as\nagreed to by the parties under Sub­ section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11</a> is\nnot followed. The High Court, therefore, while rejecting the\napplicability of the <a href=\"/doc/134104933/\" id=\"a_13\">Gujarat Tribunal Act</a>, also closed the doors for\nrelief under the provisions of the 1996 Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">10.       The said order of the High Court, which has been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                           Page 7 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                  Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                      ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nchallenged in this appeal, therefore, gives rise to the question as\nto whether in the absence of any procedure in the Arbitration\nclause for the appointment of an Arbitrator, can the Chief Justice\nof the High Court or the Designated Court appoint an Arbitrator\nunder <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11(6)</a> of the 1996 Act in 7 terms of the Agreement\nbetween the parties to have their disputes settled by arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">19. We have carefully considered the submissions made on\nbehalf of the respective parties and it appears that we are called\nupon to decide two questions in order to decide this appeal. The\nfirst and possibly basic question is whether in the absence of a\nNotification in the Official Gazette, the Municipal Corporation\ncan at all be considered as a Public Authority for the purpose of\nSection 2(1)(k) of the Gujarat Tribunal Act, 1992. The other\nquestion is whether the absence of a procedure for appointment\nof an Arbitrator in the Arbitration Agreement itself, would\nconstitute a bar for the appointment of an Arbitrator under\n<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 11(6)</a> or any other provision of the 1996 Act, when not\nonly the parties to these proceedings, but the High Court as well,\nhad arrived at a conclusion that the provisions of the Gujarat\nTribunal Act, 1992, would not be applicable in the instant case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">20. In this regard, we are inclined to accept the submissions of\nMr. Gambhir notwithstanding the fact that the Ahmedabad\nMunicipal Corporation had not been notified to be a &quot;Public\nUndertaking&quot; as defined in Section 2(1)(iii) of the Gujarat\nTribunal Act, 1992. There is no dispute that the Ahmedabad\nMunicipal Corporation is a local authority and it could assume\nthe garb of a &quot;Public Undertaking&quot; only pursuant to a\nNotification published in that regard in the Official Gazette. On\nthe other hand, even if Form B­I loses its relevance as far as the\npresent contract is concerned, since the parties have agreed to\nresolution of their disputes by arbitration, the provisions of Sub­\nsection (5) of the 1996 Act can be pressed into service to enable\nthe parties to invoke the powers of the Chief Justice to appoint an\nArbitrator. The stand taken by Mr. Divan is highly technical and\nis not in aid of resolution of the disputes between the parties by\nan Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">21. While recognizing the right of the appellant to approach\nthe Chief Justice or the Designated Court under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11(6)</a> of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                           Page 8 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                      ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nthe 1996 Act, the stand of the respondent Corporation has been\nthat the party should be relegated to suit, which is quite contrary\nto the stand taken by it in the case of other employees.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">22. <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 11</a> of the 1996 Act deals exclusively with the\nappointment of Arbitrators. Sub­section (2) provides that the\nparties are free to agree on a procedure for appointing the\nArbitrator or Arbitrators but subject to Sub­section (6) which\nprovides that if an agreed procedure had not been acted upon,\nthe parties could approach the Chief Justice or his Designate for\nappointment of an Arbitrator. Sub­sections (3), (4) and (5)\ncontemplate different situations in which the Chief Justice or his\nDesignate could be requested to appoint an Arbitrator. In our\nview, in the facts of this case, the answer to the question thrown\nup in this appeal lies in Sub­clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 11</a> of the 1996\nAct, which reads as follows :­\n\n\n&quot;11 (5) Failing any agreement referred to in sub­section (2), in\nan arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties fail to agree\non the arbitrator within thirty days from receipt of a request by\none party from the other party to so agree the appointment shall\nbe made, upon request of a party, by the Chief Justice or any\nperson or institution designated by him.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">23. Having arrived at the aforesaid conclusion, the only\nquestion that remains to be decided is whether this matter should\nbe remitted to the High Court for appointment of an Arbitrator\nor whether we should ourselves appoint an Arbitrator in terms of\nthe Arbitration Agreement. Remitting the matter to the High\nCourt would only mean another round of litigation, whereas if\nthe appointment is made by us, the matter will achieve finality,\nwhich would ultimately be beneficial for all concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">24. We, accordingly, allow the appeal and appoint Hon&#x27;ble Mr.\nJustice C.K. Thakker, a former Judge of the Supreme Court,\npresently settled at D­64, Akash Towers, Judges&#x27; Bungalow Road,\nVastrapur, Ahmedabad to be the Arbitrator for settlement of the\ndisputes which have arisen between the parties. The learned\nArbitrator shall fix his own fees and shall also formulate the\nprocedure to be adopted by him during the arbitration\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                           Page 9 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                     ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nproceedings. The Arbitrator shall try and publish his Award as\nexpeditiously as possible, but positively within six months from\nthe date of entering upon the Reference. The Arbitrator will also\ndecide the venue and sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal in\nconsultation with the parties. The judgment and order of the\nHigh Court impugned in this appeal is, accordingly, set aside. The\ncosts of this appeal shall be the costs in the arbitration\nproceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">6.           Learned counsel for the petitioner further relied\nupon the decision of this Court dated 20th January 2012 in\nPetition Under Arbitration Act No.91 of 2011 in case of\nRajkamal Builders Infrastructure Pvt Ltd., Vs. Ahmedabad Urban\nDevelopment Authority &amp; 1. Relevant paragraphs whereof are\nset­out as under :­\n\n&quot;19. To bring the dispute within the said term therefore, it\nwould be necessary that the undertaking should have been\nnotified by the State Government in the official gazette. In the\npresent case, the AUDA has not been notified by the State\nGovernment and the proceedings under the said provision,\ntherefore, would not be maintainable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_29\">Reference in this regard\nmay be made to the decision of Apex Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_19\">Om\nConstruction Co. v.

We have carefully considered the submissions made on\nbehalf of the respective parties and it appears that we are called\nupon to decide two questions in order to decide this appeal. The\nfirst and possibly basic question is whether in the absence of a\nNotification in the Official Gazette, the Municipal Corporation\ncan at all be considered as a Public Authority for the purpose of\nSec. 2(1)(k) of the Gujarat Tribunal Act, 1992. The other\nquestion is whether the absence of a procedure for appointment\nof an Arbitrator in the Arbitration Agreement itself, would\nconstitute a bar for the appointment of an Arbitrator<a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_20\"> u/s. 11(6)</a>\nor any other provision of the 1996 Act, when not only the parties\nto these proceedings, but the High Court as well, had arrived at a\nconclusion that the provisions of the Gujarat Tribunal Act, 1992,\nwould not be applicable in the instant case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">20. In this regard, we are inclined to accept the submissions of\nMr. Gambhir notwithstanding the fact that the Ahmedabad\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                          Page 10 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                       ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nMunicipal Corporation had not been notified to be a &quot;Public\nUndertaking&quot; as defined in Sec. 2(1)(iii) of the Gujarat Tribunal\nAct, 1992. There is no dispute that the Ahmedabad Municipal\nCorporation is a local authority and it could assume the garb of a\n&quot;Public Undertaking&quot; only pursuant to a Notification published\nin that regard in the Official Gazette. On the other hand, even if\nForm B­I loses its relevance as far as the present contract is\nconcerned, since the parties have agreed to resolution of their\ndisputes by arbitration, the provisions of Sub­sec. (5) of the 1996\nAct can be pressed into service to enable the parties to involve the\npowers of the Chief Justice to appoint an Arbitrator. The stand\ntaken by Mr. Divan is highly technical and is not in aid of\nresolution of the disputes between the parties by an Arbitral\nTribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">20. In any case, the parties have in uncertain terms agreed\nthat the reference would be made to an arbitrator under the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_21\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996</a>, which\nbeing a Central Act would override the requirement for\napproaching the Tribunal under the local Act as held by the Apex\nCourt in case of VA Tech Escher Wyass Flovel Ltd. vs. MPSI Board\nand Anr. In which it is observed as under :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;It appears that the appellant was awarded a work contract by\nthe respondents.

Petition is disposed of.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"74574429\" id=\"span_36\">7.            Learned counsel for the petitioner also relied upon\nthe decision of this Court dated 22th January 2016 in Petition\nUnder Arbitration Act No.64 of 2015 in case of <a href=\"/doc/74574429/\" id=\"a_25\">Chitra\nConstruction Company Vs. District Panchayat</a>.              Relevant\nparagraphs whereof are set­out as under :­</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">2.     This request for appointment of arbitrator is opposed by\nthe Panchayat on two grounds. Firstly, that the work order was\nissued by Panchayat at the instance of the Government and that\ntherefore, in terms of the said arbitration clause, the disputes\nmust be referred to Arbitration Tribunal constituted under the\n<a href=\"/doc/16512451/\" id=\"a_26\">Gujarat Public Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal\nAct, 1992</a>. Second ground of opposition is that if it is held that\nsuch dispute would not be maintainable before the Tribunal, it\nmust be treated that there is no arbitration clause and therefore,\nalso request to appoint arbitrator cannot be made.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">3.    Both the grounds of opposition cannot be accepted. Firstly,\nrespondent Amreli District Panchayat is admittedly not a notified\nauthority in terms of clause(k) of subsection(1)   of <a href=\"/doc/1804257/\" id=\"a_27\">section 2</a>\nof the Gujarat Public Works Contracts Disputes Arbitration\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                          Page 12 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                 Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                        ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nTribunal Act, 1992 , which defines the term work contract as\nunder :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;(k) Works contract means a contract made by the State\nGovernment or the public undertaking with any other person for\nthe execution of any of its works relating to construction, repairs\nor maintenance of any building or superstructure, dam, weir,\ncanal, reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert, factory or\nworkshop or of such other work of the State Government or, as\nthe case may be, of the public undertaking, as the State\nGovernment may, by notification in the official Gazete specify\nand includes\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(i) a contract made for the supply of goods relating to the\nexecution of any of such works,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(ii) a contract made by the Central Stores Purchase Organisation\nof the State Government for purchase or sale of goods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(iii) Words and expressions used and not defined in this Act but\ndefined in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_28\">Arbitration Act</a>, shall have the meanings assigned\nto them in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_29\">Arbitration Act</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">4.    In terms of such provision, thus the arbitration contract\nmeans a contract made by the State Government or the public\nundertaking with any other person for execution of any of its\nworks relating to construction repair etc. as the State\nGovernment may by notification in official gazette specify.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_40\">5.     The contract in the nature of work order is admittedly\nissued by respondent District Panchayat and not by the State\nGovernment. There is thus no privity of contract between the\npetitioner and the Government. Coming to the question of\nexistence of arbitration agreement, issue is squarely covered by\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_30\">Om Construction\nCompany v. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and another</a>\nreported in (2009) 2 Supreme Court Cases 486, which is\nfollowed consistently by this Court, particularly in case of\nRajkamal Builders Infrastructure Limited v.

These appeals by special leave are by the\n             State of Orissa aggrieved by the orders of the Chief Justice of\n             Orissa High Court allowing the applications filed under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n             11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 (`Act&#x27; for\n             short) filed by contractors and appointing arbitrators to decide\n             the disputes raised by them against the State Government. The\n             learned Chief Justice held that the last sentence of the proviso to\n             clause 10 of the conditions of contract (forming part of the\n             agreements between the state and the contractors) is an\n             arbitration agreement. The appellants challenge the said orders\n             on the ground that there is no arbitration agreement and\n             therefore the applications under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 11</a> of the Act filed by\n             the contractors ought to have been dismissed. Therefore the\n             short question that arises for our consideration in these appeals\n             is whether the said clause is an arbitration agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">      23.    That clause 10 was never intended to be an arbitration\n      agreement is evident from the contract itself. It is relevant to note the\n      Standard Conditions of Contract of the state government, as originally\n      formulated consisted a provision (Clause 23) relating to settlement of\n      disputes by arbitration, which is extracted below :\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">             &quot;Except where otherwise provided in the contract, all questions\n             and disputes relating to the meaning of the specifications,\n             designs, drawings and instructions herein before mentioned and\n             as to the quality of workmanship, or materials used on the\n             work, or as to any other question, claim, right, matter or thing\n             whatsoever, in any way arising out of or relating to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                   Page 17 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                            Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                          ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n       contract,    designs,    drawing,     specifications,   estimates,\n       instructions, orders or these conditions, or otherwise concerning\n       the work, or the execution, or failure to execute the same,\n       whether arising during the progress of the work or after the\n       completion or abandonment thereof shall be referred to the sole\n       arbitration of a Superintending Engineer of the State Public\n       Works Department unconnected with the work at any stage\n       nominated by the Chief Engineer concerned. If there be no such\n       Superintending Engineer, it should be refereed to the sole\n       arbitration of Chief Engineer concerned. It will be no objection\n       to any such appointment that the arbitrator so appointed is a\n       government servant. The award of the arbitrator so appointed\n       shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties to this\n       Contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">       24.     The abovesaid clause was deleted by the State\n       Government from the Standard Conditions of Contract by\n       official Memorandum dated 24.12.1981. Contracts entered by\n       the State Government thereafter did not have the said\n       arbitration clause, though the other Conditions of Contract\n       remained the same. The contracts in all these cases are of a\n       period subsequent to 24.12.1981 and the Conditions of\n       Contract forming part of these contracts do not contain the\n       arbitration clause. When the State Government has consciously\n       and intentionally deleted the provision for arbitration from its\n       contracts, it will be a travesty of justice to read another clause\n       in the contract providing for execution of non­tendered items\n       and the method of determination of the rates therefor, as a\n       provision for arbitration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">       25.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168696\" id=\"span_57\">In fact, in <a href=\"/doc/168696/\" id=\"a_36\">Executive Engineer RCO vs. Suresh Chandra\n       Panda</a> [1999 (9) SCC 92], this Court considered the effect of\n       the said clause relating to execution of non­tendered items, vis­\n       `­vis clause 23 in a pre­1981 contract. This court held that the\n       said clause (then numbered as clause 11, numbered as clause\n       10 in subsequent contracts) was a provision which excluded the\n       issue relating to finality of rates, from the scope of arbitration\n       agreement contained in clause 23 on the following reasoning :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       (SCC p.94, para­4)\n\n\n\n&quot;4.     Under Clause 11 of the contract, there is an elaborate provision\ndealing with the power of the Engineer­in Charge to make any\nalterations or additions to the original specifications, drawings,\ndesigns and instructions. It, inter alia, provides that if for such\nalterations or additions no rate is specified in the contract, then the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                             Page 18 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                     Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                           ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nrates which are entered in the sanctioned schedule of rates of the\nlocality during the period when the work is being carried out, would be\npaid. However, if this class of work, not provided for in the sanctioned\nschedule of rates then the contractor has the right, in the manner\nspecified in that clause, to inform the Engineer­in­Charge of the rate at\nwhich he intends to carry out that work. If the Engineer­in­ Charge\ndoes not agree to this rate he is given the liberty to cancel his order\nand arrange to carry out such class of work in such manner as he may\nconsider advisable. The clause further provides that if the contractor\ncommences such additional work or incurs any expenditure in respect\nof it before the rate are determined as specified in that clause, then the\nrate or rates shall be as fixed by the Engineer­in­Charge. In the event of\na dispute, the decision of the Superintendent Engineer of the circle will\nbe final. Under Clause 23, except as otherwise provided in the contract,\nall disputes are arbitrable as set out in that clause. The finality of\nrates, therefore, under Clause 11 is a provision to the contrary in the\ncontract which is excluded from Clause 23.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">       Thus, even when the Standard Conditions of Contract\ncontained a provision for arbitration (vide clause 23), clause 10\nwas considered to be a provision dealing with a matter excepted\nfrom arbitration. Be that as it may. The proviso to clause 10,\nwhich provides that the decision of the Superintending Engineer\nis `final&#x27;, merely discloses an intention to exclude the rates for\nextra items decided by the Superintending Engineer from the\nscope of arbitration, as an excepted matter, when there was an\narbitration agreement (clause 23) in the contract. When the\narbitration agreement was deleted, provision dealing with non­\ntendered items can not be described as an arbitration agreement.\nBe that as it may.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">10.

The factum of existence of dispute cannot be denied\nby anyone as could be seen from the submission made by the\ncounsel for the petitioner and incorporated hereinabove in\nparagraph nos.1 to 2.5. therefore, the existence of dispute is not\nin question. The fact remains to be noted that the respondent\nthough is a Government organization but not notified as public\nundertaking under the provision of the Gujarat Public Works\nContracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal act, 1992 hereinafter\nreferred to as the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_37\">Gujarat Act</a>, for the sake of brevity. The fact\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                             Page 19 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                        ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nalso requires to be borne in mind that all the Government\nagencies and public sector undertakings are under obligation to\nincorporate the arbitration clause and absence thereof is always\ntreated as an aberration and deviation. The contract, work\norder, and agreement with the governmental bodies or public\nauthorities and public undertaking is essentially required to carry\nforward the policy accepted by not only the Government of India\nbut the State of Gujarat and other states that there has to be an\neffective dispute resolution mechanism and arbitration being one\nof them, it has been generally observed that in all such contracts\nthere is always an arbitration clause. The standard contract\nforms therefore, are prepared and picking up any one such\nstandard contract or terms and condition of contract would\ninvariably contain arbitration clause providing for dispute to be\nresolved by arbitration under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_38\">Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996</a> (hereinafter referred to as the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_39\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a>\nfor the sake of brevity). In the instant case, the tender document\nand agreement was one such standard contract in which the\nClause­30 as it stood had figured, but as the respondent being\nnot a notified public undertaking under the provision of the\nGujarat Arbitration Tribunal Act, the same procedure could not\nbe attracted nor the tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction would be available for\nresolving the dispute under the contract. The procedure being not\navailable under the <a href=\"/doc/134104933/\" id=\"a_40\">Gujarat Tribunal Act</a>, it appears that there\nwas mentioning that the inapplicable would be scored off.\nHowever, the Clause­30 has not been scored off and the captioned\nclearly indicative of the parties&#x27; intention to refer the dispute to\nthe tribunal also not scored off. What has been scored off is only\nprocedure. A fine question arises therefore, as to whether can\nrespondent be justified in contending that in this contract alone\nthere was an intention on the part of the parties not to resort to\narbitration proceedings at all for resolving the dispute. It is\nrequired to be noted that, it is never a case of the respondent that\nthey are at liberty to make a deviation from the avowed policy of\nthe state of referring the dispute to arbitration. The Court\nhastened to add here that the provision of law is unequivocally\nclear that the parties&#x27; agreement for arbitration as per the\ncontract is sine quo none for invoking arbitration. Therefore, if\none looks at the contract paper produced on record one would\ncome to know that wherever the intention to delete a clause\nfound to be unwarranted in the contract indicating deviation\nfrom the standard format of contract, the word delete is\nmentioned against the clause. The learned counsel for the\npetitioner is therefore justified in inviting Court&#x27;s attention to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                            Page 20 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">    C/IAAP/111/2018                                         ORDER</span>\n\n\n\nvarious clauses indicating that at many a places the clause\ncontain the word deleted. Meaning thereby the standard format\nwas not adhered to and there were some deviation. The Court&#x27;s\nattention was invited to the Clause no.24 against which the word\n&#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned, Clause no.25 against which the word\n&#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned. Clause no.31 against which the word\n&#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned. Clause no.45 the word &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned.\nClause no.47 the word &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned, Clause nos.73, 74\nand 75 the words &#x27;deleted&#x27; mentioned and there are clauses where\neither the entire clause is scored off or a part thereof is scored off.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1976302\" id=\"span_67\">The Clause 60 in respect of price variation is scored off entirely\nalong with the caption and 60A is inserted. Similarly, Clauses\n72, 73 and 77 have been scored off along with their captions. As\nagainst this, Clause no.30 clearly indicate that the said clause is\npartly retained as the scoring off is only qua the procedure as\ncould be seen from page no.97 where the clause 30 the\narbitration is figuring. The learned counsel for the petitioner&#x27;s\nreliance upon the observation of <a href=\"/doc/1976302/\" id=\"a_41\">Om Construction</a> (supra) would\ntherefore, clearly indicate that the lack of procedure or\nprescription of the procedure cannot permit parties to wriggle out\nof their initial agreement to submit to the arbitration. The\ndecision cited at the bar on behalf of the respondent so far as,\ntheir ratio and proposition of law concerned, cannot be disputed,\nbut they proceed on the premise with regard to the arbitration\nclause and its existence, whereas in the instant case, the scoring\noff of part of the clause and leaving the clause 30 with its caption\nintact with an assurance to supply a separate sheet would\nconclusively be indicative of the fact that there existed a clear\nintention of parties to submit to the arbitration tribunal in case\nof the dispute.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">12.           For the aforesaid reasons, this Court is of the view\nthat Clause 30 and its partial scoring off and leaving the Clause\n30 and its caption intact with assurance of supply a separate\nsheet for the procedure which have been established by the\npetitioner would clearly suggest that the parties were in\nagreement to refer the dispute to the arbitration and 30 being the\nclause for arbitration, the lack of providing procedure or\nomission to provide procedure would not nullify the intention of\nthe parties to refer the matter to the arbitration tribunal. In this\nview of the mater, this Court is of the view that the petitioner\nmade out a case for invoking arbitration between the parties for\nthe disputes and it is needless to say that the arbitrator has to be\nappointed for resolution of the dispute and this order and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                            Page 21 of 22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                                    Downloaded on : Sat Aug 31 04:27:56 IST 2019</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">              C/IAAP/111/2018                                    ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n        observations would not preclude the parties to in urging the\n        contentions as permissible under law before the arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">        13.          In view of whatever stated hereinabove, as this\n        Court is satisfied qua existence of dispute and the arbitration\n        clause, the Court needs to exercise power under Section­11 of the\n        Act for appointing the arbitrator for resolving the dispute. The\n        matter be posted on any Friday so that the parties may arrive at\n        a consensual name agreed by both the parties for acting as an\n        arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">        14.          At this stage, Shri Vinay Vishen, learned advocate\n        for the respondent urges the Court to stay the order for the period\n        of 6 weeks, and if not possible, then at least for 4 weeks. The\n        request of Shri Visen is strongly objected. I am of the view that 2\n        weeks, if urged for challenging the order, deserves to be granted.\n        Hence, the order may have effect only after 23rd August 2019. Put\n        up the matter on 30th August 2019. &quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">    2.
