On 31.7.2008, petitioner requested respondent\nNo.2 to intervene and to initiate conciliation proceedings, inter\nalia, submitting various demands whereby 39 workmen listed along with\n schedule were to be treated as workmen of principal employer and\nvarious other demands were also prayed for. According to petitioner\nUnion, it is very categorically stated that major thrust of demand is\nto dispense with paper arrangement of so called labour contract\nsystem which has been alleged to be sham and bogus and not genuine\ncontract and employees of  Gujarat Refinery. According to petitioner,\nin an identical demands related to 436 workmen has been referred for\nadjudication being Reference Nos.12/1993, 11/1996 and 4/2000.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.1\tOn\n8.10.2009, petitioner requested respondent No.2 to permit to amend\nthe charter of demand dated 13.6.2007 and requested to add another 31\nworkmen in the schedule. Accordingly, conciliation proceedings were\ninitiated and failure report was sent to appropriate Government by\nrespondent No.2 on 16.10.2009. On 10.5.2010, respondent No.1 through\nDesk Officer passed impugned order informing petitioner that demand\nof petitioner Union cannot be referred by appropriate Government for\nadjudication to concerned Industrial Tribunal. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4.2\tAffidavit-in-reply\nis filed by respondent No.3 opposing admission of present petition\nand raised a contention that complaint was made under Rule\n25(2)(v)(a) of Contract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Rules and\ncompetent authority has held that contract workers do not perform \nsame or similar nature of works as those performed by regular\nemployees of IOCL. Copy of order is also produced on record as\nAnnexure-R-I.\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n4.3\tIt\nis necessary to consider that failure report which has been submitted\nby Conciliation Officer under Section 12(4) of I.D.Act,1947 dated\n16.10.2009. In failure report, comments made by both parties have\nbeen narrated in detail by Conciliation Officer. According to\npetitioner Union, the contract system which is going on with\nrespondent No.3 is not true and genuine but, it is sham and bogus.\nThe review application which was preferred by petitioner Union\n(Annexure-E, Page-30) dated 1.5.2010. Even in that also, a specific\nstand has been taken by petitioner Union that contract system which\nis going on is sham and bogus and merely a paper arrangement and it\nis not genuine and real contract system continued with respondent\nNo.3. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"666157\" id=\"span_1\">Therefore, industrial dispute raised by petitioner Union to\nconsider contract employees engaged by contractor on the job and\nregularize service of contract employees in job of principal\nemployer. This specific aspect has not been considered by respondent\nNo.1 - appropriate Government because merely claimants are\nengaged by contractor on the job in which employment a contract\nlabour is not prohibited under  provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_1\">Contract Labour\n(Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act,1970</a>, that itself  is not enough\nbut, real dispute is that claimants those who are engaged by\ncontractor on job as a contract labour that contract system itself is\nmerely a paper arrangement made between principal employer and\ncontractor and such contract system is sham and bogus and not\ngenuine. Therefore, it required to be considered that claimants those\nwho are engaged by contractor on the job being an employee of\nprincipal employer or not ? This aspect has been considered by Apex\nCourt in case of <a href=\"/doc/666157/\" id=\"a_2\">Sarva Shramik Sangh v. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. &amp;\nOrs.</a>, reported in 2009 Lab.I.C. 2297.

What is impermissible is taking\nof an inconsistent plea by way of amendment thereby denying the other\nside, the benefit of an admission contained in the earlier pleading.\nMutually repugnant and contradictory pleas, destructive of each other\nmay also not be permitted to be urged simultaneously by a\nplaintiff/petitioner. But when there is no inconsistency in the facts\nalleged, a party is not prohibited from taking alternative pleas\navailable in law. Similarly, on the same facts, different or\nalternative reliefs can also be claimed. When the case of the workers\nis that the contract was sham and nominal, they could seek a relief\nthat they should be declared as the direct employees of the principal\nemployer; and if that contention failed and it is found that the\ncontract was valid, then they can seek issue a direction to the\nCentral Government to consider their representation for abolition of\ncontract labour. Similarly where the workers contend that the\ncontract between principal employer and the contractor was sham and\nmerely a camouflage to deny them the benefits of labour laws, and if\ntheir prayer for relief under <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_3\">CLRA Act</a> is rejected, they can then\nseek relief under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_4\">ID Act</a>. The contention of IOC that on account\nof the dismissal of the first petition, the second petition for a\ndifferent relief was barred either by principle of res judicata or by\nprinciple of estoppel is liable to be rejected.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">11.\tWe\nwill next consider whether the decision in SAIL-II relied on by the\nrespondents, is in any way applicable. That decision related to a\ndispute raised by the contract labour employed by VISL (an unit of\nSAIL) for prohibition of employment of contract labour in the \nprocess/operation in which they were employed and they should be\nabsorbed as regular permanent employees of VISL. The state government\nreferred the said dispute to the Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1218044/\" id=\"a_5\">section 10(1)(c)</a>\tof\nthe ID Act. Before the Labour Court, VISL contended that as the\nmatter related to regulation and abolition of contract labour,\ngoverned by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_6\">CLRA Act</a>, there could be no\nreference of the dispute to the Labour Court for adjudication under\n<a href=\"/doc/1218044/\" id=\"a_7\">section 10(1)(c)</a> of the ID Act. It was also submitted that as the\nstate government had not issued any notification prohibiting\nemployment of contract labour in terms of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_8\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act,\nthe contract labour did not have a legal right to claim absorption. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">11.1)\tAt\nthat stage, presumably to get over the said objection regarding\nmaintainability, the workmen filed an additional claim statement\nalleging that the contract entered into between VISL and the\ncontractor was sham and bogus and they should be deemed to be the\ndirect employees of the management. The Labour Court held that the\ndispute referred was whether the contract workers who were employed\nin the particular nature of contract work were justified in demanding\nabsorption as regular employees; that the said dispute pre- supposed\nthat the employees were contract workers under the contractors and\nthe question therefore was whether the contract labour system should\nbe abolished and contract workers had to be absorbed by the principal\nemployer; that the employees who sought absorption by VISL were\ncontract labour was evident from the averments made in the claim\nstatement; and that the only remedy available to them was to file\nwrit petition seeking a direction to the central government to take a\ndecision under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_9\">section 10</a> of CLRA Act to prohibit employment of\ncontract labour. The Labour Court held that the question under\nreference related to    abolition of contract labour and as the said\nquestion could be decided only by appropriate Government under\n<a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_10\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act, the dispute was not maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_11\">ID\nAct</a>. Therefore the Labour Court made an award holding that the\nreference was not maintainable.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">11.2)\tThe\nsaid award of the Labour Court was challenged in the High Court. A\nlearned single Judge allowed the writ petition and directed the Union\nof India to treat the writ petition as a petition submitted by the\nUnion raising an industrial dispute in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1817848/\" id=\"a_12\">section 2(k)</a> read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1949741/\" id=\"a_13\">section 12(1)</a> of the ID Act as also under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_14\">CLRA\nAct</a>. The learned Judge further directed the central government to\nrefer the said dispute to the Industrial Tribunal. The appeal filed\nagainst <a href=\"/doc/666157/\" id=\"a_15\">the said judgment</a> of the learned Single Judge was dismissed\nby a division bench. Aggrieved thereby SAIL approached this Court. It\nis in that background this Court held that the workmen having taken a\ndefinite stand that they were working under the contractors, and as\nthe dispute that was referred was one which arose under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_16\">CLRA Act</a>,\nthe workmen could not, by amending the claim statement filed before\nthe Labour Court, take a contradictory and inconsistent plea that the\ncontract between VISL and the contractor was sham and bogus and they\nwere the direct employees of VISL. This Court observed that it was\nimpermissible to raise such mutually destructive pleas in law, having\nregard to the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence which\nwere also applicable in industrial adjudication.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">11.3)\tWe\nhave referred to the factual situation in detail to demonstrate that\nthe said observations made in the context of the peculiar facts of\nthat case, where the reference by the state government under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_17\">ID\nAct</a> was in regard to a specific dispute that they were employees of\nthe contractor and that after prohibiting the contract labour system\nunder <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_18\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act, they should be absorbed as direct\nemployees of VISL. This court therefore held that in such a reference\nunder <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_19\">ID Act</a>, raising a contention that the  contract between VISL\nand the contractor was bogus and sham and that they were direct\nemployees of principal employer contradicted the case on the basis of\nwhich the reference was sought and reference was made, and the two\ncontentions being mutually destructive, such a plea which would\ndestroy the very reference could not be permitted to be raised. The\ndecision in SAIL-II is therefore of no assistance to the respondents.\nWhat was held to be impermissible in SAIL-II was raising inconsistent\nand mutually destructive pleas in the same proceedings. It does not\nbar a particular relief being sought in a writ petition, and when it\nis found that such a relief was inappropriate, then seeking\nappropriate relief in a different proceedings.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">11.4)\tThe\nfacts are completely different here. The issue in the first writ\npetition was with reference to <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_20\">section 10</a> of CLRA Act. The issue in\nthe second petition was whether the dispute (relating to their claim\nthat they were the direct employees of IOC) should be referred under\n<a href=\"/doc/1218044/\" id=\"a_21\">section 10(1)(c)</a> of the ID Act. The decision in SAIL II will not\ntherefore apply. When the parties are different, issues are\ndifferent, reliefs are different, the question of either res\njudicata, or finality of proceedings, acquiescence or estoppel will\nnot arise.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">Re\n: Question (ii)\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1177051\" id=\"span_2\">12.\tIt\nis true that making a reference under <a href=\"/doc/760439/\" id=\"a_22\">section 10(1)</a> of the ID Act is\nwithin the discretion of the appropriate government. Referring to the\nunamended <a href=\"/doc/760439/\" id=\"a_23\">section 10(1)</a> of ID Act this court in <a href=\"/doc/1177051/\" id=\"a_24\">State of Madras v.\nC.P.Sarathy</a> [1953 (4) SCR 334], laid down the following principles:</span>\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(I)\tThe\ngovernment should satisfy itself, on the facts and circumstances\nbrought to its notice, in its subjective opinion that an `industrial\ndispute&#x27; exists or is `apprehended.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(ii)\tThe\nfactual existence of a dispute or its apprehension and the expediency\nof making reference are matters entirely for the government to\ndecide.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(iii)\tThe\norder making a reference is an administrative act and it is not a\njudicial or a quasi-judicial act.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(iv)\tThe\norder of reference passed by the government cannot be examined by the\nHigh Court in its jurisdiction under art 226 of the Constitution to\nsee if the government had material before it to support the\nconclusion that the dispute existed or was apprehended.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">12.1)\tThe\nopening words of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_25\">section 10</a> of ID Act &quot;if any industrial\ndispute exists or is apprehended the appropriate government may&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">were replaced by the words &quot;where the appropriate government is\nof the opinion that any industrial dispute exists or is apprehended\nit may at any time&quot; by Act 18 of 1952. The issue was thereafter\nagain considered in Rohtas Industries Ltd. v. SD Agarwal [AIR 1969 SC\n707]. After referring to the propositions in Sarathy, this Court held\n:\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;This\ninterpretation of s 10(1) is based on the language of that provision\nas well as the purpose for which the power in question was given and\nthe effect of a reference.

This section is of basic\nimportance in the scheme of the Act. It shows that the main object of\nthe Act is to provide for cheap and expeditious machinery for the\ndecision of all industrial disputes by referring them to\nadjudication, and thus avoid industrial conflict resulting from \nfrequent lock-outs and strikes. It is with that object that reference\nis contemplated not only in regard to existing industrial disputes\nbut also in respect of disputes, which may be apprehended. This\nsection confers wide and even absolute discretion on the Government\neither to refer or to refuse to refer an industrial dispute as\ntherein provided.

There must be some material before the Government on\nthe basis of which it forms an opinion that an industrial dispute\nexists or is apprehended. The power conferred on the appropriate\nGovernment is an administrative power and the action of the\nGovernment in making the reference is an administrative act. The\nformation of an opinion as to the factual existence of an industrial\ndispute as a preliminary step to the discharge of its function does\nnot make it any the less administrative in character. Thus the\njurisdictional facts on which the appropriate Government may act are\nthe formation of an opinion that an industrial dispute exists or is\napprehended which undoubtedly is a subjective one, the next step of\nmaking reference is an administrative act.

However, as stated earlier,\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate Government under\n<a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 10</a> of the Act arises only where the labour contract is\ngenuine and the question whether the contract is genuine, or not can\nbe examined and adjudicated upon by the court or the industrial\nadjudicator, as the case may be.

When such dispute is raised, the\nindustrial adjudicator has to decide whether the contract is sham or\ngenuine. It is only if the adjudicator comes to the conclusion that\nthe contract is sham, that he will have jurisdiction to adjudicate\nthe dispute. If, however, he comes to the conclusion that the\ncontract is genuine, he may refer the workmen to the appropriate\nGovernment for abolition of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 10</a> of\nthe Act and keep the dispute pending.

Thereby, the principal employer directly becomes\nresponsible for taking the services of the workmen hitherto regulated\nthrough the contractor. The linkage between the contractor and the\nemployee stood snapped and direct relationship stood restored between\nthe principal employer and the contract labour as its employees.\nConsidered from this perspective, all the workmen in the respective\nservices working on contract labour are required to be absorbed in\nthe establishment of the employer.&quot;\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">19.\tA\ncourse correction, if we may use that expression, was applied by the\nConstitution Bench, in SAIL.

This <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_87\">Court further held</a>\nthat on a prohibition notification being issued under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_88\">section 10(1)</a>\nof the CLRA Act, prohibiting employment of contract labour in any\nprocess, operation or other work, if an industrial dispute is raised\nby any contract labour in regard to conditions of service, the\nindustrial adjudicator will have to consider whether the contractor\nhas been interposed either on the ground of having undertaken to\nproduce any given result for the establishment or for supply of\ncontract labour for work of the establishment under a genuine\ncontract, or as a mere ruse/camouflage to evade compliance with\nvarious beneficial legislations so as to deprive the workers of\nstatutory benefits. If the contract is found to be sham or nominal\nand merely a camouflage, then the so called contract labour will have\nto be treated as direct employees of the principle employer and the\nindustrial adjudicator should direct the principle employer to\nregularize their services in the establishment subject to such\nconditions as it may specify for that purpose. On the other hand if\nthe contract is found to be genuine and at the same time there is a\nprohibition notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_89\">section 10(1)</a> of CLRA Act, in respect\nof the establishment, the principal employer intending to employ\nregular workmen for the process, operation or other work of the\nestablishment in regard to which the prohibition notification has\nbeen issued, it shall give preference to the erstwhile contract\nlabour if otherwise found suitable, if necessary by giving relaxation\nof age. As noticed above, SAIL did not specifically deal with the\nlegal position as to when a dispute is brought before the Industrial\nAdjudicator as to whether the contract labour agreement is sham,\nnominal and merely a camouflage, when there is no prohibition\nnotification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_90\">section 10(1)</a> of CLRA Act.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">20.\tBut\nwhere there is no abolition of contract abour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_91\">section 10</a> of\nCLRA Act, but the contract labour contend that the contract between\nprincipal employer and contractor is sham and nominal, the remedy is\npurely under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_92\">ID Act</a>. The principles in Gujarat Electricity Board\ncontinue to govern the issue. The remedy of the workmen is to\napproach the industrial adjudicator for an adjudication of their\ndispute that they are the direct employees of the principle employer\nand the agreement is sham, nominal and merely a camouflage, even when\nthere is no order under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_93\">section 10(1)</a> of CLRA Act. The industrial\nadjudicator can grant the relief sought if it finds that contract\nbetween principal employer and the contractor is sham, nominal and\nmerely a camouflage to deny employment benefits to the employer and\nthat there is in fact a direct employment, by applying tests like:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">who pays the salary; who has the power to remove/dismiss from service\nor initiate disciplinary action; who can tell the employee the way in\nwhich the work should be done, in short who has direction and control\nover the employee. But where there is no notification under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_94\">section\n10</a> of the CLRA Act and where it is not proved in the industrial\nadjudication that the contract was sham/nominal and camouflage, then\nthe question of directing the principal employer to absorb or\nregularize the services of the contract labour does not arise. The\ntests that are applied to find out whether a person is an employee or\nan independent contractor may not automatically apply in finding out\nwhether the contract labour agreement is a sham, nominal and is a\nmere camouflage. For example, if the contract is for supply of\nlabour, necessarily, the labour supplied by the contractor will work\nunder the directions, supervision and control of the principal\nemployer but that would not make the worker a direct employee of the\nprincipal employer, if the salary is paid by contractor, if the right\nto regulate employment is with the contractor, and the ultimate\nsupervision and control lies with the contractor. The principal\nemployer only controls and directs the work to be done by a contract\nlabour, when such labour is assigned/allotted/sent to him. But it is\nthe contractor as employer, who chooses whether the worker is to be\nassigned/allotted to the principal employer or used otherwise. In\nshort worker being the employee of the contractor, the ultimate\nsupervision and control lies with the contractor as he decides where\nthe employee will work and how long he will work and subject to what\nconditions. Only when the contractor assigns/sends the worker to work\nunder the principal employer, the worker works under the supervision\nand control of the principal employer but that is secondary control.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">The primary control is with the contractor.&quot;\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">4.10\tRecently,\nthis Court has also taken view in case of  Food Corporation of India\nWorkers&#x27; Union v.

Thus,   former   references investigate  upon and cover personal relationship between the contesting parties while  the  latter references   deal   with   objective  aspects  of industrial activities as such.

This conclusion has been arrived at in\nthese decisions on the interpretation of  <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 10</a> of the Act.\nHowever, it has to be remembered that the authority to abolish the\ncontract labour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 10</a> of the Act comes into play only\nwhere there exists a genuine contract. In other words, if there is no\ngenuine contract and the so called contract is sham or a camouflage\nto hide the reality, the said provisions are inapplicable. When, in\nsuch circumstances, the concerned workmen raise an industrial dispute\nfor relief that they should be deemed to be the employees of the\nprincipal employer, the Court or the industrial adjudicator will have\njurisdiction to entertain the dispute and grant the necessary relief.\nIn this connection, we may refer to the following decisions of this\nCourt which were also relied upon by the counsel for the workmen.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"144538253\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"777307\" id=\"span_35\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/777307/\" id=\"a_129\">Standard -Vacuum Refining Co. of India Ltd. v. Its Workmen</a> (<a href=\"/doc/144538253/\" id=\"a_130\">AIR 1960\nSC</a> 948) (supra), an industrial dispute was raised by the workmen of\nthe appellant-company with respect to the contract labour employed by\nthe company for cleaning maintenance work at the refinery including\nthe premises and plants belonging to it. The workmen made a demand\nfor abolition of the contract system and for absorbing workmen\nemployed through the contractor into the regular service of the\ncompany. The matter was referred for adjudication to industrial\nTribunal. The company objected to the reference on the ground (1)\nthat it was incompetent inasmuch as there was no dispute between it\nand the respondents and it was not open to them to raise a dispute\nwith respect to the workmen of some other employer, viz., the\ncontractor, and (2) in any case, it was for the company to decide\nwhat was the best method of carrying on its business and the Tribunal\ncould not interfere with that function of the management. The\nTribunal held that the reference was competent. It was of the opinion\nthat the work which was being done through the contractor was\nnecessary for the company to be done daily, that doing this work\nthrough annual contracts resulted in deprivation of security of\nservice and other benefits of the workmen of the contractor and hence\nthe contract system with respect to that work should be abolished. In\nappeal, this Court held that the dispute raised was an industrial \ndispute within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 2 (k)</a> of the Industrial\nDisputes Act because (i) the respondent-workmen had a community of\ninterest with the workmen of the contractor, (ii) they had also\nsubstantial interest in the subject-matter of the dispute inasmuch as\nthe class to which they belonged was substantially affected thereby,\nand (iii) the company could give relief in the matter. The <a href=\"/doc/144538253/\" id=\"a_132\">Court\nfurther held</a> that the work in question was incidental to the\nmanufacturing process and was necessary for it and was of perennial\nnature which must be done every day. Such work is generally done by\nworkmen in the regular employment of the employer and there should be\nno difficulty in having direct workmen for that kind of work. The\nmatter would be different if the work was of intermittent or\ntemporary nature or was so little that it would not be possible to\nemploy full time workmen for the purpose. While dealing with the\ncontention that the Tribunal should not have interfered with the\nmanagements&#x27; manner of having its work done in the most economical\nand convenient way that it thought proper, and that the case in\nquestion was not one where the contract system was a camouflage and\nthe workmen of the contractors were really the workmen of the\ncompany, the Court   held that it may be accepted that the contractor\n<a href=\"/doc/144538253/\" id=\"a_133\">in that case</a> was an independent person and the system was genuine and\nthere was no question of the company carrying on the work itself and\ncamouflaging it as if it was done through contractors in order to pay\nless to the workmen. But the fact that the contract in the case was a\nbona fide one  would not necessarily mean that it should not be\ntouched by the Industrial Tribunals. If the contract had been mala\nfide and a cloak for suppressing the fact that the workmen were\nreally the workmen of the company, the Tribunal would have been\njustified in ordering the company to take over the entire body of\nworkmen and treat it as its own workmen. But because the contract in\nthe case was bona fide, the Tribunal had not ordered the company to\ntake over the entire body of workmen. It had left to the company to\ndecide for itself how many workmen it should employ and on what\nterms, and had merely directed that when selection is being made,\npreference be given to the workmen employed by the contractor. The\nCourt also held that the only question for decision was whether the\nwork which was perennial and must go on from day to day and which was\nincidental and necessary for the work of the refinery and was\nsufficient to employ a considerable number of whole-time workmen and\nwhich was being done in most concerns through direct workmen, should\nbe allowed to be done by contractors.  Considering the nature of the\nwork done and the conditions of service in the case, the Court opined\nthat the Tribunal&#x27;s decision was right and no interference was called\nfor.</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144538253\" id=\"span_36\">This\ndecision is of seminal importance for two reasons.

Its importance lies in the fact that\nit lends support to the proposition that even after the coming into\noperation of the Act, the  industrial adjudicator will have, in\nappropriate cases, jurisdiction to investigate as to whether the\ncontract is genuine or not, and if he comes to the conclusion that it\nis not, he will have jurisdiction also to give suitable relief.

But they were\nhired by contractors who had executed agreements with the petitioners\nto get such work done. When 29 of these workmen were denied\nemployment, an industrial dispute was referred by the State\nGovernment.  The Industrial Tribunal held them to be workmen of the\npetitioner.

The raw\nmaterial was supplied by the management, the factory premises\nbelonged to the management, the equipment used also belonged to the\nmanagement and the finished product was taken by the management for\nits own trade. The workmen were broadly under the control of the\nmanagement and the defective articles were directed to be rectified\nby the management.  These circumstances were conclusive to prove that\nthe workmen were workmen of the petitioner.  The <a href=\"/doc/642607/\" id=\"a_141\">Court further held</a>\nthat if the livelihood of the workmen substantially depends on labour\nrendered to produce goods and services for the benefit and\nsatisfaction of the enterprise, the absence of direct relationship or\nthe presence of dubious intermediaries cannot snap the real life\nbond.  If however, there is total dissociation between the management\nand the workmen, the employer is in substance and in real life terms\nanother.  The true test is where the workers or group of workers\nlabour to produce goods or services and these goods or services are\nfor the business of another, that another is in fact, the employer. \nHe was economic control over the worker&#x27;s skill, subsistence, and\ncontinued employment. If for any reason, he chokes off, the workers\nare virtually laid off. The presence of intermediate contractors with\nwhom alone the workers have immediate direct relationship ex\ncontractu is of on consequence when on lifting the veil or looking at\nthe consepectus of factors governing employment, the naked truth is\ndiscerned and especially since it is one of the myriad devices\nresorted to by the management to avoid responsibility when labour\nlegislation casts welfare obligations on real employer based on\nArticles 38,39,42,43,and, 43A (sic) of the Constitution.</span> \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1071315\" id=\"span_39\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1071315/\" id=\"a_142\">R.

They\nwere continuing in employment for periods ranging from 10 to 20\nyears. The contractors used to be changed but the new contractors\nwere under the terms of the agreement required to retain the workers\nof the predecessor contractors. The workers were employed through the\ncontractors for different purpose like construction and maintenance \nof roads and buildings within  plant premises, public health,\nhorticulture, water supply etc. In the agreement with the\ncontractors, it was stated that the parties shall be governed by the\nprovisions of the Act as well as by the provisions of the payment of\n<a href=\"/doc/720619/\" id=\"a_144\">Bonus Act</a>. On these facts, this Court observed as follows (at p. 2466\nof AIR) :-</span>\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">&quot;It\nis true that with the passage of time and purely with a view to\nsafeguard the interests of workers, many principal employers while\nrenewing the contracts have been insisting that the contractor or the\nnew contractor retains the old employees. In fact such a condition is\nincorporated in the contract itself. However, such a clause in the\ncontract which is benevolently inserted in the contract to protect\nthe continuance of the source of livelihood of the contract labour\ncannot by itself give rise to a right to regularisation in the\nemployment of the principal employer. Whether the contract labourers\nhave become the employees of the principal employer in course of time\nand whether the engagement and employment of labourers through a\ncontractor is a mere camouflage and a smokescreen, as has been urged\nin this case, is a question of fact and has to be established by the\ncontract labourers on the basis of the requisite material. It is not\npossible for the High Court or this Court, while exercising writ\njurisdiction or jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 136</a> to decide such\nquestions, only on the basic of the affidavits. It need not be\npointed out that in all  such cases, the labourers are initially\nemployed and engaged by the contractors. As such at what point of\ntime a direct link is established between  the contract labourers and\nthe principal employer, eliminating the contractor from the scene, is\na matter which has to be established on material produced before the\nCourt. Normally, the labour Court and the Industrial Tribunal, under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_146\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> are the competent for a to adjudicate\nsuch disputes on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence\nproduced before them.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1071315\" id=\"span_40\">Taking\ninto consideration the developments during the pendency of the writ\npetition in this Court and the offer made by the respondent-authority\nto the workmen either to accept voluntary retirement on the terms\noffered by it or to agree to be absorbed on regular basis and the\nscheme of modernisation which was in the process of implementation,\nthe Court gave certain directions in respect of 879 workmen who were\ninvolved <a href=\"/doc/1071315/\" id=\"a_147\">in that case</a>. Those directions included, among other things,\nregularisation of those workmen who had put in 10 years&#x27; continuous\nservice provided they were below 58 years of age which was the age of\nsuperannuation under the respondent-authority. The workmen so\nregularised were not to receive any difference in their contractual\nand regular wages till the date of their absorption which was to be\ncompleted within four months of the date of the order. The\nrespondent-authority was further at liberty to retrench workmen so\nabsorbed in accordance with law.
