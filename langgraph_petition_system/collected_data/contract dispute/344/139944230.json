I shall first decide whether there existed any arbitration agreement\n        \n\n\n\n    between petitioner and the respondent in the contract entered into between\n\n    the parties.    It is not in dispute that petitioner had executed the sales\n\n    contracts dated 20th August, 2008 in respect of the first sales contract and\n\n\n\n\n\n    dated 25th August, 2008 in respect of the second sales contract. Both the sales\n\n    contracts provided clause governing terms: &quot;Singapore Commodity\n\n\n\n\n\n    Exchange&quot;. Both the sales contracts also provided that the petitioner had\n\n    confirmed having sold to the respondent the goods described therein on the\n\n    terms and conditions recorded in the said sales contracts. The respondents had\n\n    subsequently made request for change of terms of payment and also for\n\n    spliting of bills of exchange. Certain amendments were required by the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                            ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:37:41 :::</span>\n                                            17/36                    ARBP-174.12.sxw\n\n    respondent to the terms and condition recorded in the sales contracts. The\n\n    Petitioner accepted the said request made by the respondents and amended\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                    \n    those terms and after accepting those terms duly amended by the petitioner,\n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n    the parties acted upon the same. There was no amendment to the                  term\n\n    &quot;Governing terms : Singapore Commodity Exchange&quot;. The vessel thereafter\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n    shifted   contained goods in question. The respondent had thereafter made a\n\n    request for reduction of rate which was not accepted by the         petitioner. All\n\n    the correspondence referred to and relied upon       in the petition, as well as\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    referred to by the respondent, including inter party correspondence, refers to\n                              \n    the sales contracts. Perusal of the sales contracts and also purchase orders\n                             \n    which was issued subsequently in the case of first sale contract and also\n\n    considering subsequent conduct of both the parties, it is clear that both the\n        \n\n    sales contracts were concluded contracts and were duly acted upon by both\n     \n\n\n\n    the parties. In my view, merely because the respondent did not sign sales\n\n    contract or did not return the copy thereof duly signed to the petitioner, would\n\n    not mean that the terms and conditions         recorded in such sales contracts\n\n\n\n\n\n    would not be binding. In view of the fact that the respondent had acted upon\n\n    the terms and conditions of the sales contract,          which       included the\n\n\n\n\n\n    provisions of Singapore Commodity Exchange, which contained arbitration\n\n    clause, in my view <a href=\"/doc/153260/\" id=\"a_27\">section 7(5)</a> the provisions of Singapore Commodity\n\n    Exchange i.e. rules framed therein stood incorporated as part of the terms\n\n    and conditions of the sales contracts      containing arbitration clause. The\n\n    parties having acted upon such terms and conditions are bound by arbitration\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                            ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:37:41 :::</span>\n                                             18/36                   ARBP-174.12.sxw\n\n    clause. In my view, the arbitration clause contained in the sales contract\n\n    though not signed by both the parties, but having acted upon, would amount\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                    \n    to arbitration agreement      in view of <a href=\"/doc/1534152/\" id=\"a_28\">section 7(4)</a> read with 7(5) of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                            \n    <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_29\">Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996</a>. I am, therefore, not inclined to accept\n\n    the submission of the respondent that there was no arbitration agreement\n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n    agreed upon by and between the parties.

The normal procedure is that the brokers from\n     both sides first agree on the vital terms over phone/telex\n     (these terms relate to Freight, Type of Ship, Lay Can (Period\n                     \n     of shipping), Demurrage Rate, Cranes, etc.) At this stage, no\n     agreement is formally signed but the terms are binding on\n     both the parties, as per the Contract of Affreightment (CoA),\n                    \n     which in the present case was entered into on the next day,\n     i.e. 17.10.2007. Certain minor modifications could go on\n     from either side on mutual agreement but in the absence of\n     any further modification, the originally agreed terms of the\n     CoA are binding on both the parties.

What needs to be understood in this context is that\n              the agreement to submit to arbitration must be in writing.\n              What is an agreement in writing is explained by para 2 of\n              Article II. If we break down para 2 into elementary parts, it\n              consists of four aspects. It includes an arbitral clause (1) in a\n\n\n\n\n\n              contract containing an arbitration clause signed by the\n              parties, (2) an arbitration agreement signed by the parties,\n              (3) an arbitral clause in a contract contained in exchange of\n              letters or telegrams, and (4) an arbitral agreement contained\n              in exchange of letters or telegrams. If an arbitration clause\n              falls in any one of these four categories, it must be treated as\n\n\n\n\n\n              an agreement in writing. In the present case, we may advert\n              to the fact that there is no letter or telegram confirming the\n              contract as such but there is certain correspondence which\n              indicates a reference to the contract in opening the letters of\n              credit addressed to the Bank to which we shall presently\n              refer to. There is no correspondence between the parties\n              either disagreeing with the terms of the contract or\n              arbitration clause. Apart from opening the letters of credit\n              pursuant to the two contracts, the appellant also addressed a\n              telex message on 23.4.1990 in which there is a reference to\n              two contracts bearing Nos.S-142 and S-336 in which they\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:37:41 :::</span>\n                                               26/36                    ARBP-174.12.sxw\n\n               stated that they want to invoke force majeure and the\n               arbitration clauses in both the contracts which are set forth\n               successively and thus it is clear that the appellant had these\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \n               contracts in mind while opening the letters of credit in the\n               bank and in addressing the letters to the bank in this regard.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">               May be, the appellant may not have addressed letters to the\n\n\n\n\n                                                               \n               respondent in this regard but once they state that they are\n               acting in respect of the contracts pursuant to which letters of\n               credit had been opened and they are invoking the force\n               majeure clause in these two contracts, it obviously means\n               that they had in mind only these two contracts which stood\n\n\n\n\n                                                              \n               affirmed by reason of these letters of credit.

The courts of law\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                         \n                are meant for imparting justice between the parties.

The facts of the present case leave no manner of\n                doubt that Jagannath obtained the preliminary decree by\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n                playing fraud on the court. A fraud is an act of deliberate\n                deception with the design of securing something by taking\n                unfair advantage of another. It is a deception in order to gain\n                                 \n                by another&#x27;s loss. It is a cheating intended to get an\n                advantage. Jagannath was working as a clerk with Chunilal\n                Sowcar. He purchased the property in the court auction on\n                                \n                behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. He had, on his own volition,\n                executed the registered release deed (Exhibit B-1S) in favour\n                of Chunilal Sowcar regarding the property in dispute. He\n                knew that the appellants had paid the total decretal amount\n                to his master Chunilal Sowcar. Without disclosing all these\n        \n\n                facts, he filed the suit for the partition of the property on the\n                ground that he had purchased the property on his own behalf\n     \n\n\n\n                and not on behalf of Chunilal Sowcar. Non-production and\n                even non-mentioning of the release deed at the trial\n                tantamounts to playing fraud on the court. We do not agree\n                with the observations of the High Court that the appellants-\n                defendants could have easily produced the certified\n\n\n\n\n\n                registered copy of Exhibit B-15 and non-suited the plaintiff.\n                A litigant, who approaches the court, is bound to produce all\n                the documents executed by him which are relevant to the\n                litigation. If he withholds a vital document in order to gain\n                advantage on the other side then he would he guilty of\n\n\n\n\n\n                playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">    28.    The learned counsel also placed reliance upon the judgment of the Supreme\n\n    Court in the case of Gaurishankar and another Vs. Joshi Amba Shankar Family Trust\n\n    (1996) 3 Supreme Court Cases 310 and Narmada Bachao (supra) on the similar\n\n    issue. However, considering the facts of this case, I am of the view that there was no\n\n    suppression of any document by the petitioner either before the arbitral tribunal or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 19:37:41 :::</span>\n                                                35/36                    ARBP-174.12.sxw\n\n    in this court. Mr. Savla the learned counsel for the petitioner in my opinion is right\n\n    in contending that the second page of purchase order was inadvertently not\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                        \n    annexed to the present petition. However, the same was produced before the arbitral\n\n\n\n\n                                                                \n    tribunal. It is submitted that the petitioner would not have been benefited by not\n\n    annexing the second page of the purchase order as the parties were governed by the\n\n    concluded sales contract and not by the purchase order. In my view reliance placed\n\n\n\n\n                                                               \n    by the respondent on the judgment of the Supreme Court referred to above is of no\n\n    assistance to the respondent.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                 \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">    29.\n                                \n           In my view, the respondents have not furnished any proof before this court\n\n    as to why the enforcement of the foreign award dated 18th December, 2009 may be\n                               \n    refused. The respondents had made counter claim before the arbitral tribunal and\n\n    thereafter did not challenge the award of claim in favour of the petitioner and\n\n    rejection of the counter claim against the respondents in any court of law. In my\n        \n\n\n    view, the said foreign award is enforceable under Part II and is binding           for all\n     \n\n\n\n    purposes on the parties under <a href=\"/doc/144997/\" id=\"a_79\">section 46</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act,\n\n    1996. I am therefore, of the view that the foreign award is already stamped as decree\n\n\n\n\n\n    and petitioner holding such foreign award has become entitled for enforcement of it\n\n    having taken     effective steps for execution of the award. As this court has taken a\n\n    view that the said foreign award is enforceable, the petitioner can proceed to take\n\n\n\n\n\n    further effective steps for execution of the same. In the circumstances, the petitioner\n\n    is directed to put the award in execution in accordance with the rules of this court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">    The Petition is accordingly made absolute in terms of prayer clause (a) and (b).
