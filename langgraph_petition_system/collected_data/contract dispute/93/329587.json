The contract bond contemplated\nguaranteed performance\tof the\twork at\t various  stages  in\naccordance with\t the time  schedule prescribed\tand provided\nfor completion\tand commissioning  of the  plant after trial\nrun by\tMay 15,\t 1984. According  to the appellant, the time\nwas  essentially   and\tindisputably   the  essence  of\t the\ncontract.\n     As per  the terms\tand conditions of the contract bond,\naccording to  the appellant, the respondent was to furnish a\nperformance bank guarantee for Rs.16.5 lakhs and yet another\nbank guarantee\tfor Rs.33  lakhs as  security for the monies\nadvanced by  the appellant to the respondent for undertaking\nthe work.  Both these  guarantees as  also the contract bond\nentitled the  appellant to  invoke them\t and call  for their\nrealisation and\t encashment on the failure of the respondent\nto perform  the obligations for which the appellant was made\nthe sole judge.\n     It was alleged that the respondent defaulted at various\nstages and  finally failed  to complete\t the work within the\nstipulated time.  The appellant\t invoked the  two guarantees\none after  the other,  and thereafter  proceeded to have the\nplant completed,  etc. According to the appellant, the plant\ncould actually\tbe commissioned for commercial production in\nJuly/August, 1985.\n     The respondent, on August 4, 1986, filed an application\nunder <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_1\">section  41</a> of  the Arbitration Act, 1940 <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_2\">(The Act</a>) in\nthe court  of the  Civil Judge,\t praying for  an  injunction\nrestraining the appellant from realis-\n1125\ning and\t encashing the\tbank  guarantees.  The\tCivil  Judge\ndismissed the  application. The\t respondent filed a revision\npetition before\t the High  Court, which\t allowed  the  same,\nholding that  the invocation  of the  performance guarantees\nwas illegal,  and the  contentions of the appellant that the\nperformance guarantees\tconstituted independent and separate\ncontracts between the guarantor bank and the beneficiary and\ncreated\t independent  rights,  liabilities  and\t obligations\nunder the  guarantee bonds  themselves, as  being &quot;technical\npleas&quot;. The  High Court, however, directed the respondent to\nkeep alive  the bank  guarantee during\tthe pendency  of the\narbitration proceedings. The appellant then moved this Court\nfor relief by special leave.\n     Allowing the appeal, The Court,\n^\n     HELD: Per Sabyasachi Mukharji, J.\n     Under the terms agreed to between the parties, there is\nno scope  of injunction.  The High  Court proceeded  on\t the\nbasis that  this was  not an  injunction sought\t against the\nbank but  against the  appellant. But  the net effect of the\ninjunction is  to restrain the bank from performing the bank\nguarantee. That\t cannot be  done. One  cannot do  indirectly\nwhat one  is not free to do directly. The respondent was not\nto  suffer   any  injustice  which  was\t irretrievable.\t The\nrespondent can\tsue the\t appellant for damages. There cannot\nbe any basis in the case for apprehension that irretrievable\ndamage would  be caused,  if any.  His Lordship\t was of\t the\nopinion that  this was not a case in which injunction should\nbe granted.  An irrevocable commitment either in the form of\nconfirmed bank\tguarantee or  irrevocable letter  of  credit\ncannot be  interfered with  except if  a case  of fraud or a\ncase  of   a  question\t of  apprehension  of  irretrievable\ninjustice has  been  made  out.\t This  is  the\twell-settled\nprinciple of  the law  in England.  This is  also the  well-\nsettled principle  of law in India. No fraud and no question\nof irretrievable injustice was involved in the case. [1138C-\nF]\n     In\t order\t to  restrain\tthe  operation\t either\t  of\nirrevocable letter  of credit  or  of  confirmed  letter  of\ncredit or  of bank  guarantee, there  should  be  a  serious\ndispute and  a good  prima facie  case of  fraud and special\nequities in  the form  of preventing irretrievable injustice\nbetween the  parties; otherwise,  the very  purpose of\tbank\nguarantees would  be negatived\tand the\t fabric\t of  trading\noperation would be jeopardised. The commitments of the banks\nmust be\t honoured free\tfrom  interference  by\tthe  courts;\notherwise, trust  in  commerce\tinternal  and  international\nwould be  irreparably damaged.\tIt is  only  in\t exceptional\ncases, that is, in\n1126\ncases of  fraud or  in cases of irretrievable injustice that\nthe court  should  interfere.  This  is\t not  a\t case  where\nirretrievable injustice\t would be done by enforcement of the\nbank guarantee. This is also not a case where a strong prima\nfacie case  of-fraud in entering into a transaction was made\nout. The High Court should not have interfered with the bank\nguarantee. The\tjudgment and  order of\tthe High  Court\t set\naside. The  order  of  the  Civil  Judge  restored.[1141A-B;\n1142D-H]\nPer K. Jagannatha Shetty, J. (concurring):\n     The crux  of  the\tmatter\trelates\t to  the  obligation\nassumed by the bank under a performance guarantee. [1143B]\n     Whether the  obligation is\t similar to  the one arising\nunder a\t letter of credit? Whether the Court could interfere\nin  regard  to\tsuch  obligation,  and\tif  so,\t under\twhat\ncircumstances? These are the questions raised in the appeal.\n[1143B-C]\n     The primary  question for\tconsideration is whether the\nHigh Court  was justified  in restraining the appellant from\ninvoking the  bank guarantees.\tThe basic nature of the case\nrelates to  the obligations  assumed by\t the bank  under the\nguarantees given  to the  appellant. If\t under the  law, the\nbank cannot  be prevented  by the  respondent from honouring\nthe  credit   guarantees,  the\t appellant  also  cannot  be\nrestrained from invoking the guarantees. What applies to the\nbank must  equally apply  to the  appellant. Therefore,\t the\nframe of the suit by not impleading the bank cannot make any\ndifference in  the position  of law.  Equally, it  would  be\nfutile to  contend that\t the court was justified in granting\nthe injunction\tsince it  has found  a prima  facie case  in\nfavour of  the respondent.  The question  of  examining\t the\nprima facie case or balance of convenience does not arise if\nthe court cannot interfere with the unconditional commitment\nmade by\t the bank  in the  guarantees in question. [1144C-D;\n1145A-B]\n     The modern\t documentary  credit  had  its\torigin\tfrom\nletters of  credit. The\t letter of credit has developed over\nhundreds of years of international trade. It was intended to\nfacilitate  the\t  transfer  of\tgoods  between\tdistant\t and\nunfamiliar buyer  and seller.  It was  found difficult for a\nbuyer to  pay for  goods prior to their delivery. The bank&#x27;s\nletter\tof   credit  came   to\tbridge\tthis  gap.  In\tsuch\ntransactions, the seller (beneficiary) receives payment from\nthe issuing  bank when he presents a demand as per the terms\nof the\tdocuments. The bank must pay if the documents are in\norder and the terms of credit are satisfied. The bank,\n1127\nhowever, was not allowed to determine whether the seller had\nactually shipped the goods or whether the goods conformed to\nthe requirements  of the  contract. Any\t dispute between the\nseller and the buyer must be settled between themselves. The\nCourts, however, in carving out an exception to this rule of\nabsolute independence,\theld that if there has been a &quot;fraud\nin the\ttransaction&quot;, the bank could dishonour beneficiary&#x27;s\ndemand for  payment. The  Courts  have\tgenerally  permitted\ndishonour only\ton the\tfraud of  the beneficiary,  not\t the\nfraud of somebody else. [1145C, E-H; 1146A]\n     In modern\tcommercial transactions, various devices are\nused to\t ensure performance  by the contracting parties. The\ntraditional letter of credit has taken a new meaning. Stand-\nby letters  of credit  are also\t used in  business  circles.\nPerformance  bond   and\t guarantee  bond  are  also  devices\nincreasingly  adopted\tin  transactions.  The\tCourts\thave\ntreated ch  documents as  analogous to\tletter of  credit. l\n1148E]\n     Whether it\t is a  traditional letter of credit or a new\ndevice, like  performance bond or performance guarantee, the\nobligation of  the bank\t appears to  be the  same. Since the\nbank pledges  its own  credit, involving  its reputation, it\nhas no\tdefence except\tin the\tcase of fraud. The nature of\nthe fraud  that the  courts talk  about is  the fraud  of an\n&#x27;egregious  nature  as\tto  vitiate  the  entire  underlying\ntransaction&quot;. It  is the fraud of the beneficiary, not fraud\nof somebody else. The bank cannot be compelled to honour the\ncredit in  such cases. In such cases, it would be proper for\nthe bank  to ask  the buyer  to approach  the court  for  an\ninjunction. The court, however, should not lightly interfere\nwith the  operation of\tirrevocable documentary\t credit.  In\norder to  restrain the\toperation of  irrevocable letter  of\ncredit, performance  bond or  guarantee, there\tshould be  a\nserious dispute to be tried and there should be a good prima\nFacie act of fraud . [1149E-H; 1150A]\n     The sound\tbanking system\tmay, however,  require\tmore\ncaution in  the issuance  of irrevocable documentary credit.\nIt would  be for  the banks to safeguard themselves by other\nmeans, and,  generally, not  for the courts to come to their\nrescue with  injunctions unless\t there is established fraud.\nThe appeal  must be  allowed, and  the order  of  the  civil\njudge, restored.

It appears that\nthe appellant,\ta State\t Government enterprise,\t on or about\n17th  of   May,\t 1983  entered\tinto  a\t contract  with\t the\nrespondent-a private  limited company  for  the\t supply\t and\ninstallation  of   a  Vanaspati\t  manufacturing\t  plant\t  at\nHarducharu\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">1129</span>\nin the\tDistrict of Nainital, in the State of Uttar Pradesh.\nThe contract  bond contemplated, according to the appellant,\nguaranteed  performance\t  of  work   at\t various  stages  in\naccordance with\t the time  schedule prescribed\ttherein\t and\nprovided for completion and commissioning of the plant after\ndue trial  run by the 15th May, 1984. The appellant contends\nthat time  was essentially  and indisputably  the essence of\nthe contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">     The contention  of the  appellant was  that as  per the\nterms and  conditions of  the contract\tbond, the respondent\nwas to\tfurnish a  performance bank  guarantee for  Rs\t16.5\nlakhs and  yet another\tbank guarantee\tfor Rs.33  lakhs  as\nsecurity for  the monies  advanced by  the appellant  to the\nrespondent  for\t  undertaking  the   work.  Both  these\t two\nguarantees as  also the contract bond entitled the appellant\nto invoke them and call for their realisation and encashment\non the\trespondent&#x27;s failing  to perform the obligations for\nwhich the appellant was made the sole judge\n     The 15th of May, 1984 was the date fixed for completion\nand commissioning  of the plant after 15 days&#x27; trial run for\ncommercial production.\tIt was alleged that between the 26th\nof December,  1984 and\t28th of January, 1985 the respondent\ndefaulted at  various stages  and finally failed to complete\nthe work  within the  stipulated time. The appellant invoked\nthe two\t guarantees  one  after\t the  other.  The  appellant\nthereafter on  15th March,  1985 proceeded to have the plant\ncompleted  and\tthe  plant  was\t formally  inaugurated.\t The\nappellant  contends   that  the\t  plant\t could\tactually  be\ncommissioned for commercial production in July/August, 1985.\nThe respondent on 4th of August, 1986 filed a petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_3\">section 41</a>  of the  Arbitration Act 1940 (hereinafter called\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_4\">Arbitration\t Act</a>), in  the Court  of  the  Civil  Judge,\nLucknow praying\t for an order restraining the appellant from\nrealising and  encashing the  bank guarantees.\tThe  learned\nCivil Judge  for the  reasons indicated\t in his\t order dated\n8.8.86 declined\t to issue  any injunction  and dismissed the\napplication\n     Being  aggrieved\tby  the\t  aforesaid  decision,\t the\nrespondent went\t up before  the Allahabad  High\t Court.\t The\nlearned Single\tJudge of  the Allahabad\t High Court,  by the\nimpugned  judgment  of\t20th  February,\t 1987,\tallowed\t the\nrevision petition  and\theld  that  the\t invocation  of\t the\nperformance guarantees\twere illegal  and further  held\t the\ncontentions of the appellant that the performance guarantees\nconstituted independent\t and separate  contracts between the\nguarantor bank\tand the\t beneficiary and created independent\nrights, liabilities and obligations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">1130</span>\nunder the  guarantee bonds  themselves, as  being &quot;technical\npleas.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     On\t 17th  May,  1983,  as\tmentioned  hereinbefore,  an\nagreement had  been executed  between the  appellant and the\nrespondent wherein it was decided as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t  &quot;WHEREAS  THE\t  PCF  (the  appellant\therein)\t has\n\t  decided to  set up  a Vanaspati Plant of 62 5 M.T.\n\t  per day  Vanaspati Capacity, comprising of 70 M.T.\n\t  per day  hardening capacity  based on 95% usage of\n\t  soyabean oil\tas raw\toil 62.5  M.T. per day, post\n\t  refining   capacity,\t 72   M.T.   deodoursisation\n\t  capacity and\t72 M.T filling and packing capacity,\n\t  complete with\t all  necessary\t utilities  such  as\n\t  water\t and   steam  Distribution   Equipments\t oil\n\t  Storage Section  Electrification and\tDistribution\n\t  Equipments   Automatic    Weighing   filling\t and\n\t  packing/sealing   equipments\t and   fire-fighting\n\t  equipments etc,  at Halducharu,  District Nainital\n\t  (UP) lying  at Bareilly-Haldwani  road  about\t 3.5\n\t  Kms.\tfrom  Lalkuan  towards\tHaldwani.&quot;  and\t the\n\t  agreement further stated:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t  &quot;AND WHEREAS\tthe seller  (the respondent  herein)\n\t  has undertaken  to provide  technical know-how and\n\t  fabricate, design, engineer, manufacture, procure,\n\t  import, supply, erect, instal, give trial runs and\n\t  commission the  Vanaspati Complex  as referred  to\n\t  above\t complete  in  all  respects  at  Halducharu\n\t  District-Nainital  (U.P.)  as\t per  specifications\n\t  contained at\tAnnexures &#x27;A&#x27;  to &#x27;Q&#x27;  and signed by\n\t  both the  parties in\ttoken of incorporation as an\n\t  integral part\t of this  agreement with  guaranteed\n\t  performance\ton    the   terms   and\t  conditions\n\t  hereinafter appearing and contained.\n\t  AND  WHEREAS\t the  contract\tprice  here-in-after\n\t  mentioned is based on the &#x27;Seller&#x27;s undertaking to\n\t  com  mission\t and  make   ready  for\t  commercial\n\t  production the  said Vanaspati  Complex by May 15,\n\t  1984 and if the seller fails to do so the contract\n\t  price\t shall\t stand\treduced\t to  the  extent  as\n\t  hereinafter provided.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t  AND  WHEREAS\t the  contract\t price\t hereinafter\n\t  mentioned  is\t  also\tbased\ton  the\t  guaranteed\n\t  performance of the said Vanaspati Complex as here-\n\t  in-after  provided  and  it  is  a  term  of\tthis\n\t  Agreement that if the said Vanaspati Complex fails\n\t  to give the guaranteed performance as hereinafter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">1131</span>\n\t  specified, the  contract price shall stand reduced\n\t  to the extent hereinafter provided.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">     Clause 1.6\t stipulated that  the date  of commissioning\nand handing  over shall\t be the\t date on which the PCF takes\nover the  complete Plant  after successful commissioning and\nfulfilling  of\t guaranteed  performance  specified  in\t the\nagreement.

The High Court was of the view that prima facie\nit appeared that the plant was handed over\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1134</span>\nafter a\t trial run  and that  the commercial  production had\nstarted and A this has not been assailed as a fact. The High\nCourt was  of the  view, that  in these\t circumstances\tthis\ncannot be  said that  the invocation  order  was  final\t and\nirrevocable. The  High Court  was further  of the  view that\nhaving taken  over  the\t possession  of\t the  plant  it\t was\nnecessary to consider all the aspects and held that the bank\nguarantees could  not be  invoked. The High Court was of the\nview  that   it\t was  not  a  question\tof  restraining\t the\nperformance of any bank guarantee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">     I am,  however, unable  to agree.\tThe principles\tupon\nwhich the bank guarantees could be invoked or restrained are\nwell-settled  our   attention  was  also  drawn\t to  several\ndecisions of  the High\tCourt as  well\tas  of\tthis  Court.\nReference  had\talso  been  made  to  some  of\tthe  English\ndecisions.  So\tfar  as\t the  position\tof  English  law  is\nconcerned, the\tprinciples by  now are\twell-settled. I will\nrefer to some of the decisions and explain the position.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     The question  arose  before  the  Court  of  Appeal  in\nEngland in  Hamzeh Melas  &amp; Sons  v. British Imex Industries\nLtd., [1958] 2\tQ.B  .D.  127.\tThere  the  plaintiffs,\t a\nJordanian firm,\t contracted to purchase from the defendants,\na British  firm, a  large quantity of reinforced steel rods,\nto be  delivered  in  two  instalments\tPayment\t was  to  be\neffected by  the opening  in favour of the defendants of two\nconfirmed letters  of credit  with the Midland Bank Ltd., in\nLondon, one  in respect\t of each  instalment. The letters of\ncredit were  duly opened  and the  first was realized by the\ndefendants on  the delivery  of the  first  instalment.\t The\nplaintiffs complained  that  instalment\t was  defective\t and\nsought an  injunction to  bar the  defendants from realizing\nthe second  letter of  credit. Justice\tDonovan refused\t the\napplication. The  plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal\nin England.  It was  held that\talthough the  Court had wide\njurisdiction to\t grant injunction,  this was  not a  case in\nwhich, in the exercise of its discretion, it ought to do so.\nThe Court  of Appeal emphasised that an elaborate commercial\nsystem had  been built\tup on  the footing  that a confirmed\nletter of  credit constituted  a bargain  between the banker\nand the\t vendor of  the goods, which imposed upon the banker\nan absolute  obligations to pay, irrespective of any dispute\nthere might  be between the parties whether or not the goods\nwere up\t to contract.  The  principle  was  that  commercial\ntrading must go on the solemn guarantee either by the letter\nof credit  or by  bank\tguarantee  or  irrespective  of\t any\ndispute between contracting parties whether or not the goods\nwere upto  contract. The  banks cannot\tbe absolved of their\nresponsibility to  meet the  obligations. Lord\tJenkins L.J.\nObserved that a vendor of goods selling against a con\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">1135</span>\nfirmed letter of credit was selling under the assurance that\nnothing would  prevent it from receiving the price. That was\nof no  mean advantage when goods manufactured in one country\nwere sold  in another. Though, in this case no international\ntrade was  involved, bank  guarantee was  uninvocable and on\nthat  assurance\t  parties  have\t  bargained  This  principle\nenunciated by Lord Justice Jenkins has been invokved by this\nCourt in some decisions in case of confirmed bank guarantee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">     The Court\tof Appeal in England had occasion once again\nto consider  this question  in Elian and Rabbath (Trading as\nElian &amp;\t Rabbath). v.  Matsas and  Matsas &amp;  ors., [1966]  2\nLloyd&#x27;s List  Law Reports  495. In  that case injunction was\ngranted to  prevent irretrievable injustice. There the facts\nwere peculiar In that case the first defendants&#x27; Greek motor\nvessel Flora  M was  chartered by  Lebanese  charterers\t for\ncarriage of  plaintiffs&#x27; cargo\t(consigned to  Hungary) from\nBeirut to  Rijeka.  Discharge  was  delayed  at\t Rijeka\t and\nshipowners exercised  lien on  cargo in respect of demurrage\nThird defendant bank put up guarantee in London in favour of\nsecond\tdefendants  (first  defendants&#x27;\t London\t agents)  to\nsecure release\tof cargo.  There was a claim by Yugoslavians\nto distrain  on goods,\tinvolving ship\tin further delay and\nmaster of  Flora M,  on lifting\t original lien,\t immediately\nexercised another  lien in respect of extra delay (which was\nraised when Hungarian buyers put up  2000) Two years later,\nshipowners claimed  arbitration with  charterers  to  assess\ndemurrage for  which first lien was exercised and claimed to\nenforce\t guarantee.   Plaintiff\t claimed   declaration\tthat\nguarantee  was\t not  valid   and  injunction\tto  restrain\nshipowners or  their agents  from enforcing  guarantee First\nand  second   defendants  appealed   against   granting\t  of\ninjunction by  Blain, J.  It was held by the Court of Appeal\nthat it\t was a\tspecial case in which the Court should grant\nan  injunction\t to  prevent  what  might  be  irretrievable\ninjustice. Lord\t Denning, M  R., observed  that although the\nshippers  were\t not  parties\tto   the   bank\t  guarantee,\nnevertheless they had a most imporant interest in it. If the\nMidland Bank  Ltd., paid  under this  guarantee, they  would\nclaim against  the Lebanese  bank, who\tin turn\t would claim\nagainst\t the  shippers.\t The  shippers\twould  certainly  be\ndebited with  the account.  On being  so debited, they would\nhave to\t sue the  shipowners for  breach  of  their  promise\nexpress or implied, to release the goods. Lord Denning, M R,\nfurther posed the question were the shippers to be forced to\ntake that  course? or  can they short-circuit the dispute by\nsuing the  shipowners at  once for an injunction? He further\nobserved on  page 497  of the Report that this was a special\ncase in\t which injunction should be granted. Lord Denning, M\nR. went on to observe that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">1136</span>\nthere was a prima facie ground for saying that, on the telex\nmessages A  which passed  (and indeed,\ton the\tfirst  three\nlines of the guarantee) the shipowners promised that, if the\nbank guarantee\twas given,  they would release the goods. He\nfurther observed that the only lien they had in mind at that\ntime was  the lien  for demurrage.  But would anyone suppose\nthat the  goods would  be held for another lien? It can well\nbe argued  that the guarantee was given on the understanding\nthat the  lien was  raised and\tno further lien imposed, and\nthat when  the shipowners,  in breach  of that understanding\nimposed a  further lien,  they were  disabled from acting on\nthe guarantee  But as  mentioned here-in-before,  this was a\nvery special case and I shall notice that Lord Denning, M R.\ntreated this as a very special case and in later decision he\nexpressed his views on this matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">     This question was again considered by the Queen s Bench\nDivision by  Mr. Justice Kerr in R.D. Harbottle (Mercantile)\nLtd. and  Another v.  National Westminister  Bank  Ltd.\t and\nothers, [1977]\t2 All  England Law Reports 862. In this case\ninjunction  was\t sought\t on  a\tquestion  in  respect  of  a\nperformance bond. The learned Single Judge Kerr, J. gave the\nfollowing views:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\t  &quot;i) only  in exceptional  cases would\t the  courts\n\t  interfere  with   the\t machinery   of\t irrevocable\n\t  obligations assumed  by banks.  In the  case of  a\n\t  confirmed performance\t guarantee, just  as in\t the\n\t  case of a confirmed letter of credit, the bank was\n\t  only concerned  to ensure  that the  terms of\t its\n\t  mandate and  confirmation had\t been complied\twith\n\t  and was  in no  way concerned with any contractual\n\t  disputes  which  might  have\tarisen\tbetween\t the\n\t  buyers and sellers. Accordingly, since demands for\n\t  payment had  been made  by the  buyers  under\t the\n\t  guarantees and  the plaintiffs had not established\n\t  that the  demands were fraudulent or other special\n\t  circumstances,   there   were\t  no   grounds\t for\n\t  continuing the injunctions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">\t  &quot;ii) It  was right  to discharge  the\t injunctions\n\t  against the  bank,  the  fact\t that  the  Egyptian\n\t  defendants had  taken no  part in  the proceedings\n\t  could not  be a  good ground for maintaining those\n\t  injunctions.\t   Further,\t equally      strong\n\t  considerations applied  in favour of the discharge\n\t  of   the    injunctions   against   the   Egyptian\n\t  defendants, and  their failure  to participate  in\n\t  the proceedings  did not  preclude the  court from\n\t  discharging the injunctions against them.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">1137</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">     In my  opinion the\t aforesaid  represents\tthe  correct\nstate of  the A\t law. The  Court dealt\twith three different\ntypes of cases which need not be dilated here\n     In\t Edward\t Owen  Engineering  Ltd.  v.  Barclays\tBank\nInternational Ltd.,  [1978] 1 All England Law Reports 1976.\nEnglish suppliers,  entered  into  a  contract\twith  Libyan\nbuyers to  supply goods\t to them  in Libya  The contract was\nsubject to  a condition\t precedent that the plaintiffs would\narrange for a performance bond or guarantee to be given, for\nten per cent of the contract price, guaranteeing performance\nof their  obligations under  the contract.  Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs instructed  the defendants  their bankers to give\non their behalf a performance guarantee for the sum of pound\n50,203.\t Acting\t  on  those   instructions  the\t  defendants\nrequested a  bank in  Libya to issue performance bond to the\nbuyers for  that sum, and promised the Libyan bank that they\nwould pay  the amount  of the  guarantee  on  first  demand,\nwithout any  conditions or  proof. The\tLibyan bank issued a\nletter of  guarantee for  pound 50,203\tto  the\t buyers\t The\ncontract between  the plaintiffs and the buyers provided for\npayment of  the price  of the  goods supplied by a confirmed\nletter of  credit. The letter of credit opened by the buyers\nwas not\t a confirmed letter of credit and did not therefore,\ncomply with  the contract Because of that non-compliance the\nplaintiffs repudiated  the contract.  Although\tit  was\t the\nbuyers who appeared to be in default and not the plaintiffs,\nthe buyers  nevertheless claimed  on the  guarantee given by\nthe Libyan  bank who  in turn claimed against the defendants\non the guarantee they had given The plaintiffs issued a writ\nagainst the  defendants claiming  an injunction\t to restrain\nthem from  paying any  sum under the performance guarantee A\njudge granted  the plaintiffs  an interim  injunction in the\nterms of the injunction claimed by the writ but subsequently\nanother\t judge\tdischarged  the\t injunction  The  plaintiffs\nappealed to the Court of Appeal in England. It was held by a\nBench consisting  of Lord Denning M. R., Browne and Geoffrey\nLane, LJ  that a  performance guarantee\t was  similar  to  a\nconfirmed letter  of credit.  Where therefore,\ta  bank\t had\ngiven a\t performance guarantee it was required to honour the\nguarantee according  to its  terms  and\t was  not  concerned\nwhether either\tparty to  the contract\twhich  underlay\t the\nguarantee was in default The only exception to that rule was\nwhere fraud by one of the parties to the underlying contract\nhad been  established and  the bank had notice of the fraud.\nAccordingly,  as  the  defendants&#x27;  guarantee  provided\t for\npayment on  demand without  proof or  conditions, and was in\nthe nature  of a  promissory note  payable on demand and the\nplaintiffs had\tnot established\t fraud on  the part  of\t the\nbuyers, the defendants were re-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">1138</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">quired to  honour their\t guarantee on the demand made by the\nLibyan Bank.  It followed  that the  judge had been right to\ndischarge the  injunction  and\tthat  the  appeal  would  be\ndismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">     Lord Denning,  M.R. held that Justice Kerr was right in\ndischarging the injunction and reiterated that the bank must\nhonour its  commitment. The principle must be that upon that\nbasis trade  and commerce are conducted. Lord Denning, M.R.,\nindicated at  page &#x27;984\t that seeing that the bank must pay,\nand will  probably come\t down on  the English  suppliers  on\ntheir counter-guarantee, it followed that the only remedy of\nthe English  suppliers was  to sue  the Libyan customers for\ndamages. The  contract contained  a clause  giving exclusive\njurisdiction to the courts of Libya.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">     In the instant case, the learned Judge has proceeded on\nthe basis that this was not an injunction sought against the\nbank  but   this  was  the  injunction\tsought\tagainst\t the\nappellant But  the  net\t effect\t of  the  injunction  is  to\nrestrain the  bank from\t performing the\t bank guarantee That\ncannot be  done. One  cannot do\t indirectly what  one is not\nfree  to   do  directly.   But\ta  maltreated  man  in\tsuch\ncircumstances is  not remedyless  The respondent  was not to\nsuffer any injustice which was irretrievable. The respondent\ncan sue the appellant for damages. In this case there cannot\nbe any\tbasis for  apprehension that  irretrievable  damages\nwould be caused if any. I am of the opinion that this is not\na case\tin which injunction should be granted An irrevocable\ncommitment either in the form of confirmed bank guarantee or\nirrevocable letter  of\tcredit\tcannot\tbe  interfered\twith\nexcept\tin   case  of  fraud  or  in  case  of\tquestion  of\napprehension of\t irretrievable injustice  has been made out.\nThis is\t the well-settled  principle of\t the law in England.\nThis is\t also a well-settled principle of law in India, as I\nshall presently\t notice from  some of  the decisions  of the\nHigh Court and decisions of this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">     In the  instant case there was no fraud involved and no\nquestion of irretrievable in justice was involved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">     Before, however,  I deal  with the\t decisions of  India\nreference may be made to a decision of the House of Lords in\nUnited City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. and others v. Royal\nBank of\t Canada and others, [1982] 2 All England Law Reports\n720 where  it  was  reiterated\tthat  the  whole  commercial\npurpose\t for  which  the  system  of  confirmed\t irrevocable\ndocumentary credits  had  been\tdeveloped  in  international\ntrade was to give the seller of goods an assured right to be\npaid before he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">1139</span>\nparted with control of the goods without risk of the payment\nbeing refused  reduced or deferred because of a dispute with\nthe buyer.  It followed that the contractual duty owed by an\nissuing or confirming bank to the buyer to honour the credit\nnotified by  him on  presentation of  apparently  conforming\ndocuments by  the seller  was  matched\tby  a  corresponding\ncontractual liability  on the part of the bank to the seller\nto pay\thim the\t amount of the credit on presentation of the\ndocuments The bank&#x27;s duty to the seller was only vitiated if\nthere was  fraud on  the part  of the  seller, and  the bank\nremained under a duty to pay the amount of the credit to the\nseller even  if the documents presented, although conforming\non their  face with  the terms\tof the\tcredit, nevertheless\ncontained  a   statement  of  material\tfact  that  was\t not\naccurate. These\t principles must in my opinion apply in case\nof bank guarantees in internal trade within a country.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"588000\" id=\"span_12\">I may  notice that in India, the trend of law is on the\nsame line In the case of <a href=\"/doc/588000/\" id=\"a_5\">Texmaco Ltd. v.

This  Court observed that the\nHigh Court  was wrong  in granting  the temporary injunction\nrestraining the\t appellant bank\t from recalling\t the  amount\npaid to\t the respondent\t bank. This  Court  reiterated\tthat\nCourts usually\trefrain from granting injunction to restrain\nthe performance\t of the\t contractual obligations arising out\nof a  letter of credit, or a bank guarantee between one bank\nand another. If such temporary injunction were to be granted\nin a  transaction between a banker and a banker, restraining\na bank\tfrom recalling\tthe amount due when payment was made\nunder reserve  to another  bank or in terms of the letter of\nguarantee or  credit executed by it the whole banking system\nin the country would fail\n     The Court\thowever, observed  that\t the  opening  of  a\nconfirmed letter of credit constituted a bargain between the\nbanker and  the seller\tof the\tgoods which  imposed on\t the\nbanker an  absolute obligation\tto pay.\t The banker  was not\nbound or  entitled to  honour the bills of exchange drawn by\nthe seller  unless they\t and such  accompanying documents as\nmight be  required thereunder, were in exact compliance with\nthe terms of the credit.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1871958\" id=\"span_21\">This principle  was again\treiterated by  this Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1871958/\" id=\"a_12\">Centax\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">1142</span>\n(India) Ltd.  v.

Otherwise,  trust in  commerce internal\t and\ninternational would  be irreparably  damaged.

I\nwish, however,\tto draw\t attention to some of the aspects of\nthe matter  to which  I attach\timportance. The\t crux of the\nmatter relates to the obligation assumed by the bank under a\nperformance guarantee.\tWhether the obligation is similar to\nthe one\t arising under a letter of credit? Whether the Court\ncould interfere\t in regard  to such  obligation, and  if so,\nunder what  circumstances? These are the questions raised in\nthis appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">     The facts which are relevant for my purpose are these:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     On May  17, 1983,\tM/s. Singh  Consultants &amp;  Engineers\n     (Pvt.) Ltd.  (&quot;SCE (P)  Ltd.&quot;) entered  into a contract\n     with U.P.\tCooperative Federation\tLtd. (&quot;UPCOF  Ltd.&quot;)\n     for constructing  a Vanaspati  manufacturing  plant  at\n     Haldpur, District\tNainital, U.P. The contract required\n     that UPCOF Ltd. should be given two bank guarantees for\n     proper construction and successful commissioning of the\n     plant. In accordance with the terms of the contract,the\n     Bank of  India gave  two guarantees  in favour of UPCOF\n     Ltd.,   one    for\t  Rs.16,50,000\t and   another\t for\n     Rs.33,00,000.   These   contain   similar\t terms\t and\n     conditions. Thereunder,  the bank has undertaken not to\n     revoke the\t guarantee in any event before the expiry of\n     the due  date. The\t Bank has  also undertaken  to\tmake\n     unconditional payments  on demand. without reference to\n     SCE (P) Ltd. The guarantee also provides that the UPCOF\n     Ltd. was  the sole\t judge for  deciding whether  SCE(P)\n     Ltd. has  fulfilled the  terms of\tthe contract or not.\n     The guarantee  was thus  undisputedly irrevocable\twith\n     absolute discretion for UPCOF Ltd. to invoke the same.\n     The  dispute  arose  between  the\tparties\t as  to\t the\nerection and  performance of  the  plant.  The\tSCE(P)\tLtd.\napprehending that  the bank  guarantees would  be invoked by\nthe UPCOF  Ltd, approached  the Court  of the  Civil  Judge,\nLucknow for a restraint order against the latter. The action\nwas brought  under <a href=\"/doc/28932/\" id=\"a_14\">Sec.\t 41</a> of the Arbitration Act read with\norder 39  r.  1\t and  2\t <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_15\">of  the  Code\tof  Civil  Procedure</a>\ncontending inter-alia,\tthat there  was no  default  in\t the\nconstruction or delivery of possession of the plant. But the\nUPCOF Ltd.  had a  different version.  It contended that the\nconstruction  was   not\t within\t  the  time   schedule\t and\nperformance of the plant was not up to the mark. It also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">1144</span>\ncontended that\tthe Court should not grant injunction in the\nmatter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     The trial\tcourt refused  to interdict  UPCOF Ltd.\t the\nSCE(P) Ltd.  took up  the matter  in revision before Lucknow\nBench of  the Allahabad High Court. The learned Judge before\nwhom the  matter came  up for  disposal was of the view that\nSCE(P) Ltd.  has made  out a prima facie case . It has prima\nfacie proved  that the plant was delivered after a trial run\nand commercial\tproduction had\tstarted. So stating, learned\nJudge allowed  the revision  and granted  the relief  sought\nfor. The  UPCOF Ltd.  was restrained  from invoking the bank\nguarantees. The\t learned Judge,\t however, issued a direction\nto SCE(P)  Ltd. to keep alive the bank guarantees during the\npendency of the arbitration proceedings.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     The UPCOF Ltd. by special leave has come up before this\nCourt challenging  the validity\t of the\t order of  the\tHigh\nCourt. The Primary question for consideration is whether the\nHigh Court  was justified  in restraining the appellant from\ninvoking the  Bank guarantees?\tThe submission\tof Mr.\tA.B.\nDiwan learned  counsel for  the appellant  rested on the law\ngoverning the irrevocable letter of credit where courts keep\nthemselves away\t from the liability assumed by the banks. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1871958\" id=\"span_26\">In\nsupport of  the submission, the counsel strongly relied upon\nthe two\t decisions of this Court: (i) United Commercial Bank\nv.. <a href=\"/doc/1871958/\" id=\"a_16\">Bank  of India  &amp; Ors., [1981] 3 SCR 300 and (ii) Centax\n(India) Ltd.  v. Vinmar\t Impex Inc. &amp; Ors.</a> [1986] 4 SCC 136.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">Mr. V.M. Tarkunde, learned counsel for the respondent or the\nother hand,  urged that\t both the  said\t decisions  are\t not\nrelevant since\tthe present  case concerns  with rights\t and\nobligations of\tparties under  a construction  contract. The\nrights under the contract in question are justiciable in the\nCourt of  law. The  performance guarantee  given by the Bank\nflows from  the terms  of the construction contract. But the\nissues to  be determined  in the  suit do  not relate to the\nobligations of\tthe bank  under the guarantees given and the\nbank is\t also not  a party  to the suit. The counsel further\nurged that the respondent has established a prima facie case\nto justify the grant of injunction and this Court should not\ninterfere with the discretionary relief granted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">     The argument  for the  respondent is  attractive but it\nseems to  overlook the\tbasic nature  of the case. The basic\nnature of the case relates to the obligations assumed by the\nbank under  the guarantees given to UPCOF Ltd. If under law,\nthe bank  cannot be  prevented by  SCE(P) Ltd from honouring\nthe  credit  guarantees,  the  UPCOF  Ltd.  also  cannot  be\nrestrained from invoking the guarantees. What applies\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">1145</span>\nto the\tbank must equally apply to UPCOF Ltd. Therefore, the\nframe of the suit by not impleading the bank cannot make any\ndifference in  the position  of law.  Equally, it  would  he\nfutile to  contend that\t the court was justified in granting\nthe injunction\tsince it  has found  a prima  facie case  in\nfavour of  the SCE(P)  Ltd. The\t question of  examining\t the\nprima facie case or balance of convenience does not arise if\nthe court cannot interfere with the unconditional commitment\nmade by the bank in the guarantees in question.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">     The modern\t documentary  credit  had  its\torigin\tfrom\nletters of  credit. We\tmay, therefore, begin the discussion\nwith the traditional letter of credit. Paul R. Verkuil in an\narticle [Bank  Solvency\t and  Guaranty\tLetters\t of  Credit,\nStandford Law Review V. 25 (1972-73 at p. 719)] explains the\nsalient features of a letter of credit in these terms: C\n\t  &quot;The letter  of credit  is a contract. The issuing\n\t  party-usually\t  a   bank-promises   to   pay\t the\n\t  &#x27;beneficiary&#x27;-traditionally a\t seller of  goods-on\n\t  demand  if   the  beneficiary\t  presents  whatever\n\t  documents may\t be required by the letter. They are\n\t  normally the\tonly two  parties  involved  in\t the\n\t  contract. The bank which issues a letter of credit\n\t  acts\tas   a\tprincipal,  not\t as  agent  for\t its\n\t  customer, and\t engages its  own credit. The letter\n\t  of credit  thus &#x27;evidences-irrevocable  obligation\n\t  to honour  the draft\tpresented by the beneficiary\n\t  upon compliance with the terms of the credit.&quot;\n     The letter\t of credit  has been developed over hundreds\nof years  of international  trade. It was most commonly used\nin conjunction with the sale of goods between geographically\ndistant parties.  It was intended to facilitate the transfer\nof goods between distant and unfamiliar buyer and seller. It\nwas found  difficult for  the seller to rely upon the credit\nof an  unknown customer.  It was  also found difficult for a\nbuyer to  pay for  goods prior to their delivery. The bank&#x27;s\nletter of  credit came into existence to bridge this gap. In\nsuch transactions, the seller (beneficiary) receives payment\nfrom issuing  bank when he presents a demand as per terms of\nthe documents.\tThe bank  must pay  if the  documents are in\norder and  the terms  of credit\t are  satisfied.  The  bank,\nhowever, was not allowed to determine whether the seller had\nactually shipped the goods or whether the goods conformed to\nthe requirements  of the  contract. Any\t dispute between the\nbuyer and the seller must be settled between themselves. The\nCourts, however,  carved out  an exception  to this  rule of\nabsolute independence.\tThe Courts  held that  if there\t has\nbeen &quot;fraud in the transaction\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">1146</span>\nthe bank  could dishonour  beneficiary&#x27;s demand for payment.\nThe A  Courts have generally permitted dishonour only on the\nfraud of the beneficiary, not the fraud of somebody else.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">     It was perhaps for the first time the said exception of\nfraud to  the rule of absolute independence of the letter of\ncredit has been applied by Shientag, J. in the American case\nof Sztejn  v. J.  Henry Schroder  Banking  Corporation,\t (31\nN.Y.S. 2d  631). Mr. Sztejn wanted to buy some bristles from\nIndia and so he entered into a deal with an Indian seller to\nsell him  a quantity.  The issuing  bank issued\t a letter of\ncredit to the Indian seller that provided that, upon receipt\nof  appropriate\t documents,  the  bank\twould  pay  for\t the\nshipment. Somehow  Mr. Sztejn  discovered that\tthe shipment\nmade was  not crates  of bristles,  but crates\tof worthless\nmaterial and  rubbish. He  went to  his bank  which probably\ninformed him  that the\tletter of  credit was an independent\nundertaking of the bank and it must pay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">     Mr. Sztejn\t did not  take that sitting down. He went to\ncourt and  he sought  an injunction. Now in 1941 people just\ndid not\t get injunctions  against payment  under letters  of\ncredit. The  defendant bank, against its customer, filed the\nequivalent of  a motion\t to dismiss  for failure  to state a\nclaim. In  that posture all the allegations of the complaint\nwere taken  as true,  and those allegations were gross fraud\nthat the  holders in  due course  were\tinvolved.  On  those\nfacts, the court issued an injunction against payment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">     The exception  of fraud  created in  the above case has\nbeen codified  in sec. 5-114 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\nIt has\tbeen accepted  by Courts in England.

The exception for fraud on the\n\t  part of  the beneficiary  seeking to avail himself\n\t  of the  credit is a clear application to the maxim\n\t  ex trupi  cause  non\toritur\tactio  or  if  plain\n\t  English is  to be preferred, &#x27;fraud unravels all&#x27;,\n\t  the courts will not allow their process to be used\n\t  by a dishonest person to carry out a fraud.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1834541\" id=\"span_30\">This was  also the\t view taken  by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1834541/\" id=\"a_17\">United\nCommercial Bank</a>\t case [1981]  3 SCR  300.

Sen, J. following the decision\nin the\t<a href=\"/doc/1834541/\" id=\"a_18\">United Commercial Bank</a> case said: &quot;We do not see why\nthe same principles should not apply to a banker&#x27;s letter of\nindemnity.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">     It is  true that both the decisions of this Court dealt\nwith  a\t  contract  to\t sell  specific\t  commodities  or  a\ntransaction of\tsale of\t goods with an irrevocable letter of\ncredit.\t But  in  modern  commercial  transactions,  various\ndevices are  used to  ensure performance  by the contracting\nparties. The  traditional letter  of credit  has taken a new\nmeaning. In  business circles, standby letters of credit are\nalso used.  Performance bond and guarantee bond are also the\ndevices increasingly  adopted in  transactions.\t The  Courts\nhave treated such documents as analogous to letter of cedit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">     A case  involving the  obligations under  a performance\nguarantee was  considered by  the Court\t of Appeal in Edward\nOwen Engineering  Ltd. v. Barclay&#x27;s Bank International Ltd.,\n[1978]\t1 All  E.R. 976.  The facts in that case are these:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">English sellers\t entered into a contract to supply and erect\nglass-houses in\t Libya. The  Libyan buyers  were to  open an\nirrevocable letter  of credit  in favour of the sellers. The\nsellers told  their  English  bank  to\tgive  a\t performance\nguarantee. The\tEnglish bank  instructed a  Libyan  bank  to\nissue a\t performance bond  in favour  of the  buyers  for  a\ncertain sum  and gave  their  guarantee\t payable  on  demand\nwithout proof  or conditions  to cover\tthat sum. The Libyan\nbank issued  a bond  accordingly. The  sellers\treceived  no\nconfirmed letter  of credit  and refused to proceed with the\ncontract. The  sellers obtained\t in  interim  injunction  to\nprevent the  English bank  from paying\ton the guarantee. On\nappeal Lord Denning M.R. said:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">1149</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">\t       &quot;So as on takes instance after instance these\n\t  performance guarantees  are  virtually  promissory\n\t  notes payable\t on demand.  So long  as the  Libyan\n\t  customers make  an honest  demand, the  banks\t are\n\t  bound to  pay and  the banks will rarely, if ever,\n\t  be in\t a position  to know  whether the  demand is\n\t  honest or  not. At  any rate they will not be able\n\t  to prove it to be dishonest. So these will have to\n\t  pay. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">And said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t       &quot;All this  leads to  the conclusion  that the\n\t  performance guarantee\t stands on a similar footing\n\t  to a\tletter of  credit.  A  bank  which  gives  a\n\t  performance guarantee\t must honour  that guarantee\n\t  according to its terms. It is not concerned in the\n\t  least with  the relations between the supplier and\n\t  the  customer:   nor\twith  question\twhether\t the\n\t  supplier has\tperformed his contractual obligation\n\t  or not;  nor with the question whether supplier is\n\t  in default  or not. The bank must pay according to\n\t  its  guarantees,   on\t demand\t if  so\t stipulated,\n\t  without proof or conditions. The only exception is\n\t  when there  is a clear fraud of which the bank has\n\t  noticed. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">     Whether it\t is a  traditional letter of credit or a new\ndevice like  performance bond  or performance guarantee, the\nobligation  of\t banks\tappears\t to  be\t the  same.  If\t the\ndocumentary credits  are irrevocable  and  independent,\t the\nbanks must  pay when  demand is made. Since the bank pledges\nits own\t credit involving  its reputation, it has no defence\nexcept in  the case  of fraud.\tThe  bank&#x27;s  obligations  of\ncourse should  not be  extended to  protect the unscrupulous\nseller, that is the seller who is responsible for the fraud.\nBut, the  banker must be sure of his ground before declining\nto pay.\t The nature  of the fraud that the Courts talk about\nis fraud  of an\t &quot;egregious nature  as to vitiate the entire\nunderlying transaction&quot;. It is fraud of the beneficiary, not\nthe fraud  of somebody\telse. If  the bank  detects  with  a\nminimal investigation  the fraudulent  action of the seller,\nthe payment  could be  refused. The bank cannot be compelled\nto honour  the credit  in such\tcases. But  it may  be\tvery\ndifficult for  the bank\t to take  a decision  on the alleged\nfraudulent action. In such cases, it would be proper for the\nbank  to  ask  the  buyer  to  approach\t the  Court  for  an\ninjunction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">     The Court,\t however, should  not lightly interfere with\nthe operation  of irrevocable  documentary credit.  I  agree\nwith my learned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">1150</span>\nbrother\t that\tin  order   to\trestrain  the  operation  of\nirrevocable letter of credit, performance bond or guarantee,\nthere should be serious dispute to be tried and there should\nbe a  good prima  facie acts of fraud. As Sir John Donaldson\nM.R. said  in Bolivinter  oil SA  v. Chase  Mannattan Bank &amp;\nors. [1984] 1 All E.R. 35 1 at 352:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\t       &quot;The  wholly   exceptional  case\t  where\t  an\n\t  injunction may  be granted  is where\tit is proved\n\t  that the  bank knows\tthat any  demand for payment\n\t  already made\tor which may thereafter be made will\n\t  clearly be  fraudulent. But  the evidence  must be\n\t  clear both  as to  the fact of fraud and as to the\n\t  bank&#x27;s knowledge.  It would certainly not normally\n\t  be   sufficient    that   this    rests   on\t the\n\t  uncorroborated  statement  of\t the  customer,\t for\n\t  irreparable damage  can be done to a bank&#x27;s credit\n\t  in the  relatively brief  time which\tmust  elapse\n\t  between the  granting of such an injunction and an\n\t  application by the bank to have it discharged.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">     From the  above discussion, what appears to me is this:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">The sound  banking system may, however, require more caution\nin the issuance of irrevocable documentary credits. It would\nbe for\tthe banks to safeguard themselves by other means and\ngenerally not  for the\tcourt to  come to  their rescue with\ninjunctions  unless  there  is\testablished  fraud.  In\t the\nresult, this  appeal must be allowed. The judgment and order\nof the\tAllahabad High Court dated February 20, 1987 must be\nset aside  and the  order of  learned Civil  Judge,  Lucknow\ndated August 8, 1986 restored.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">S.L.\t\t\t\t\t     Appeal allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">1</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>","numcites":11,"numcitedby":469,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":329587,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"bank fraud","formInput":"bank%20fraud"},{"value":"temporary injunction","formInput":"temporary%20injunction"},{"value":"irretrievable injustice","formInput":"irretrievable%20injustice"},{"value":"international trade","formInput":"international%20trade"},{"value":"letter of credit","formInput":"letter%20of%20credit"},{"value":"all india reporter","formInput":"all%20india%20reporter"},{"value":"special equity","formInput":"special%20equity"},{"value":"contractual obligations","formInput":"contractual%20obligations"},{"value":"grant of injunction","formInput":"grant%20of%20injunction"},{"value":"performance guarantee","formInput":"performance%20guarantee"},{"value":"no interim injunction","formInput":"no%20interim%20injunction"},{"value":"bank guarantee ","formInput":"bank%20guarantee%20"},{"value":"performance bank guarantee","formInput":"performance%20bank%20guarantee"},{"value":"lien","formInput":"lien"},{"value":"fraud case","formInput":"fraud%20case"},{"value":"what is commercial production","formInput":"what%20is%20commercial%20production"},{"value":"it is well settled principle","formInput":"it%20is%20well%20settled%20principle"},{"value":"irretrievable","formInput":"irretrievable"},{"value":"beneficiaries  filter:  trust cases","formInput":"beneficiaries%20%20filter%3A%20%20trust%20cases"},{"value":"\"prima facie case\"","formInput":"%22prima%20facie%20case%22"}],"cats":[{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"},{"value":"special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court","formInput":"tag:special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
