The appellant has called in question the\n\norder passed by the 19th Addl. City Civil and Sessions\n\nJudge at Bengaluru (CCH-18) [&#x27;trial court&#x27; for short&#x27;] on\n\ninterim applications in O.S.Nos.7648, 7649, 7650 and\n\n7651 of 2017, filed by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 8</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 [&#x27;Act&#x27; for\n\nshort] and consequently allow the interim applications.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     3.      Facts in brief are, 1st respondent filed Civil\n\nSuits bearing O.S.Nos.7648, 7649, 7650            and 7651 of\n\n2017 before the trial court against the appellant and 2nd\n\nrespondent     herein,   inter   alia   seeking    permanent\n\ninjunction restraining the appellant from invoking the\n\nBank Guarantees issued under Letter of Award [LOA]\n\nand the 2nd respondent from taking any action in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                -6-</span>\n\n\nrelation to the said Bank Guarantees. The contract was\n\nentered by the appellant with the 1st respondent herein\n\nvide LOA dated 15.5.2013 inter alia for design, supply,\n\nerect, test and commission the electrical balance of\n\nPlant for 2x660 MW Power plant project.             The 1st\n\nrespondent issued unconditional Bank Guarantees in\n\nterms of the aforesaid LOA. The appellant has invoked\n\nsome of the Bank guarantees for 1st respondent&#x27;s breach\n\nof terms of the LOA and the same were honoured by the\n\n2nd respondent-Bank.       The 1st respondent filed Civil\n\nSuits   before   the   trial    court   seeking   permanent\n\ninjunction restraining the defendant No.1/appellant\n\nfrom encashing the Bank guarantees and restraining\n\nthe defendant No.2/respondent No.2-Bank from acting\n\non the basis of the letter of invocation issued by the\n\nappellant demanding invocation of Bank Guarantees.\n\nThe appellant entered appearance before the trial court\n\nand filed application/s IA-2 under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 8</a> of the Act\n\nseeking reference of parties to arbitration.       The trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                            -7-</span>\n\n\ncourt dismissed the said application/s. Being aggrieved,\n\nthe appellant has preferred these appeals.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">     4.    Learned counsel Sri.Ajay.J.N, appearing for\n\nthe appellant contended that in terms of Clause 21 of\n\nthe LOA, the appellant and the 1st respondent agreed to\n\nsettle all the disputes whatsoever within the said LOA\n\nby way of arbitration.      The   arbitration clause    as\n\ncontained in General Conditions of Contract (GCC) has\n\nbeen incorporated by reference as between the appellant\n\nand 1st respondent.    In terms of clause 19 of GCC, the\n\nparties agreed to constitute an arbitral Tribunal as per\n\nthe procedure expressly stipulated therein.        The 1st\n\nrespondent filed Civil Suits before the trial court against\n\nthe appellant and 2nd respondent inter alia seeking\n\npermanent injunction restraining the appellant from\n\ninvoking the Bank Guarantees issued under Letter of\n\nAward [LOA] and the 2nd respondent from enchashing\n\nthe same on the ground that the 1st respondent had not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                           -8-</span>\n\n\nbreached the terms of contract/LOA. The trial court\n\ndismissed the IA-2 filed by the appellant without\n\nappreciating clause 21 of LOA and clause 19 of the\n\nGCC.    Clause 19 of the GCC has been expressly\n\nincorporated in the arbitration clause in the LOA and 1st\n\nrespondent has agreed to the contractual terms and\n\ncannot be allowed to renege from the same. The trial\n\ncourt evidently misconstrued GCC to be a company;\n\nignored the terms of GCC produced before it vide\n\nappellant&#x27;s memo dated 17.11.2017; merely on the\n\nground that clause 19 of &quot;GCC Company&quot; has not been\n\nproduced by both the parties.    It was submitted that\n\nwhen the parties expressly and unequivocally agreed to\n\nsettle the disputes arising out of the LOA by way of\n\narbitration, the trial court ought to have referred the\n\nmatter for arbitration and hence, the impugned order is\n\nliable to be set-aside. It was further submitted that as\n\nper the pleadings, 1st respondent did not dispute the\n\narbitration clause contained in clause 19 of the GCC\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                            -9-</span>\n\n\nstood incorporated by reference into arbitration clause\n\nin the   LOA,   however erroneously contended         that\n\nrespondent No.1 is not bound by clause 19 of the GCC\n\nsince it was not a party. The impugned order is based\n\non an erroneous understanding of the contractual terms\n\nand conditions of the disputes between the parties\n\ninasmuch the trial court holding the commission of the\n\nUnit would tantamount to completion of the project as\n\nper the requirements of LOA and the arbitration clause\n\ndoes not survive for consideration, while it is not even\n\nthe pleadings of the 1st respondent before the trial court.\n\nThus, it was contended that there is no discussion\n\nabout <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8</a> of the Act by the trial court while\n\nexamining about the arguments advanced by the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties.     On the basis of the\n\napplication filed under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8</a> of the Act, contract\n\nwas completed between the parties. Thus filing suits for\n\ninjunction to restrain the defendant No.1/appellant\n\nfrom invoking the Bank Guarantees is unsustainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">                           - 10 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\nThe trial court without appreciating these vital aspects\n\nproceeded to reject the application on some flimsy\n\ngrounds which cannot be upheld in these appeals.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">     5.

Learned Senior counsel Sri.K.G.Raghavan\n\nfor Sri.Anind Thomas, learned counsel appearing for\n\nrespondent No.1 submitted that indeed there were three\n\ncontracts,   first   one   between   the   appellant   and\n\nSembcopor Gayatri Power Limited, to which respondent\n\nNo.1 was not a party. Trial court considered the said\n\nSembcopor Gayatri Power Limited as &quot;GCC company&quot;.\n\nSecond contract was between the appellant and the 1st\n\nrespondent; sub-contract in which arbitration clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">                           - 12 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">\nwas referred to, in terms of clause 21.0 incorporating\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_12\">Article   19.0</a> of GCC; third contract between the\n\nappellant and the 2nd respondent, pertaining to the\n\nBank Guarantees executed by the 1st respondent in\n\nterms of LOA to which 1st respondent was not a party.\n\nThus, learned Senior counsel contended that these\n\nthree contracts are independent and separate, unless a\n\nspecial reference to arbitration clause is mentioned in\n\nthe Bank guarantee, the same cannot be read into a\n\nBank gurantee and when there is no arbitration clause\n\nin the Bank Guarantee, the application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 8</a>\n\nof the Act is not maintainable. Thus, it was submitted\n\nthat if the two contracts are separate, arbitration clause\n\nin the original contract cannot be imported in the\n\ncontract of Bank guarantee.        The original arbitration\n\nagreement may be very wide or general in terms but\n\nthat certainly does not include a dispute arising under a\n\nseparate agreement with a separate party, i.e. Bank\n\nguarantee and the Bank.      It was contended that the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">                            - 13 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">\nmemo along with clause 19 of GCC filed before trial\n\ncourt by the appellant does not bear the signature of the\n\nparties. Hence, the court below proceeded to decide the\n\nmatter as no clause 19 of the GCC was placed on\n\nrecord. It was argued that while considering the\n\napplication for referring the parties to arbitration, the\n\ncontents of the plaint as also the arbitration agreement\n\nand in which the applicant wants the court to read the\n\naverments has to be examined. Respondent No.1 had\n\nmade it clear in the plaint before the trial court that the\n\nBank guarantee had not incorporated the arbitration\n\nclause.   Thus, it was submitted that the order of the\n\ntrial court in its entirety has to be examined rather than\n\nfinding   fault   with   some   abbreviations   i.e.   GCC,\n\nconstruing it as a company. Harmonious reading of the\n\nJudgment impugned would disclose the mind of the\n\ncourt in arriving at a decision.      The trial court on\n\nappreciation of the material facts rightly rejected the\n\napplication filed by the appellant as no case was made\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                                 - 14 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">\nout    for   referring   the    matter    to   arbitral    Tribunal\n\ninasmuch as invoking of the Bank guarantees by the\n\nappellant.     According to the learned Senior counsel,\n\nthere was no occasion for the appellant to invoke the\n\nBank Guarantees of the concluded contract.                   It was\n\nsubmitted that application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8</a> of the Act\n\nwas considered by the trial court.                 There is no\n\ndefects/deficiencies as pointed out by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner in dismissing the applications.\n\nThus, he seeks for dismissal of the appeals.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">       7.

It is the contention of the appellant that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 19</a> of the GCC has to be incorporated in terms of\n\nclause 21.0 of LOA.      Much emphasis is placed by the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant on this GCC said to\n\nhave been submitted before the trial Court which has\n\nnot been considered.       The said GCC filed along with\n\nmemo as per Annexure-F in MFA No.1235/2018 bears\n\nthe seal and signature of the appellant-company.\n\nExcept the seal and signature of the appellant-company,\n\nthis document does not bear the signature of other\n\ncompany with whom this GCC has been executed. In\n\nsuch circumstances, placing reliance on this document\n\nwould not lend any assistance to the appellant.\n\nSubsection    (2)   of   <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_27\">Section     8</a>   mandates   that   the\n\napplication referred to in Subsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8</a>\n\nshall not be entertained unless it is accompanied by\n\noriginal arbitration agreement or duly certified copy\n\nthereof. Further the proviso appended thereto provides\n\nthat original arbitration agreement or certified copy\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                           - 23 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\nthereof is not available with the party applying for\n\nreference to arbitration under Subsection (1) and the\n\nsaid agreement or certified copy retained by the other\n\nparty to that agreement, then, the party so applying\n\nshall file such an application along with copy of the\n\narbitration agreement and a petition praying the court\n\nto call upon the other party to produce the original\n\nagreement or its duly certified copy before that court. It\n\nis manifest that neither original arbitration agreement\n\nor duly certified copy thereof was accompanied with the\n\napplication filed by the appellant in terms of Subsection\n\n(1) of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8</a> nor it is the case of the appellant coming\n\nwithin the ambit of the proviso thereof. It is obligatory\n\non the court to refer the dispute to arbitration if the\n\nparameters specified in Subsection (2) and the proviso\n\nthereof are complied with.         Hence, trial court has\n\ncategorically observed that no clause 19 of the GCC was\n\nfurnished by either of the parties to examine the\n\napplicability of arbitration clause by reference in terms\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                            - 24 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">\nof LOA. Though no explicit reference is made to <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n\n8</a> of the Act, the reasoning/finding of the trial court is in\n\nconformity with the said provision. Hence, it cannot be\n\nheld that there was no application of mind by the trial\n\ncourt in rejecting the applications.        The pith and\n\nsubstance relating to the provision gains credence\n\nrather than quoting a provision\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">      11.   It is true that the trial court referred GCC as\n\na company perhaps for the reason that said GCC was\n\nexecuted between the appellant and M/s Sembcopor\n\nGayatri Power Limited, a company. However, the\n\nreasons assigned and decision arrived denotes that\n\nplaintiff/ respondent No.1 was not a party to the said\n\nGCC. It has been observed that Clause 19 referred to in\n\nthe GCC was not made available before the court.\n\nHowever, respondent No.1 in paragraph 23 of the plaint\n\nhas admitted about the arbitration clause in LOA,\n\nstated that the same is not applicable and invoked, as\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">                           - 25 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">\nthe Defendant No.2/respondent No.2, which is an\n\nintegral and inextricable part of the cause of action and\n\nagainst whom reliefs have been expressly sought, is not\n\nparty to LOA and the cause of action cannot be\n\nbifurcated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_64\">     12.      Learned counsel for the appellant mainly\n\nargued that the suit is not maintainable or in other\n\nwords, an obligation was cast on the trial court to\n\nexamine the ouster of the Civil Court where an\n\narbitration clause has been contemplated in the LOA.\n\nThe cause of action in the suits filed by respondent No.1\n\nis relating to the Bank Guarantees, as such the crucial\n\nquestion would be whether the Bank guarantee is a\n\nseparate contract to which the plaintiff/respondent No.1\n\nis not a party and contains any arbitration clause to\n\nrefer the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8</a> of the Act. To answer this question, it would\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">                            - 26 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">\nbe beneficial to refer to the relevant Judgments referred\n\nto by the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">     13.    In the case of Befesa Agua&#x27;s case (supra),\n\nthe High court of Madras has held thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">            45.   Further, as per Clause 14.2, the\n     Second Applicant, who is the Contractor shall\n     deliver to the Company, namely the Second\n     Respondent, a Performance Guarantee&#x27; of all\n     obligations and responsibility, which may\n     derive from the execution of the contract,\n     which shall be issued by a Bank, which is\n     acceptable    for   the   Second   Respondent.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">     Similarly, under Clause 15.2, the Performance\n     Guarantee has to be executed in connection\n     with   the obligations    and   responsibilities,\n     which may derive from the execution of the\n     Supply Contract. Therefore, having regard to\n     the execution of these Bank Guarantee as per\n     Clause 14.2 of the ECC contract and Clause\n     15.2 of the Supply Contract, the question is\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">                                - 27 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">\n     whether the Arbitration Clause in those\n     contracts can be incorporated into the Bank\n     Guarantee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"20317\" id=\"span_12\">14.

The\nArbitration Clause from another contract can\nbe incorporated into the contract (where such\nreference       is    made),        only        by    a   specific\nreference to Arbitration Clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">(iii) Where a contract between the parties\nprovides that the execution or performance of\nthat contract shall be in terms of another\ncontract    (which        contains         the       terms   and\nconditions relating to performance and a\nprovision       for    settlement          of    disputes      by\nArbitration), then, the terms of the referred\ncontract in regard to execution/performance\nalone will apply, and not the Arbitration\nAgreement in the referred contract, unless\nthere is special reference to the Arbitration\nClause also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">(iv)    Where the contract provides that the\nstandard form of terms and conditions of an\nindependent trade or professional institution\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">                         - 29 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">\n(as for example the Standard Terms and\nConditions of a Trade Association) will bind\nthem or apply to the contract, such standard\nform of terms and conditions including any\nprovision for Arbitration in such Standard\nTerms and Conditions, shall be deemed to the\nincorporated by reference.

In our opinion, the point is now well-\n    settled. A bank guarantee may be furnished in\n    terms of a particular contract between two\n    parties. In terms of the conditions of the\n    contract, a bank guarantee may be provided by\n    a bank in favour of one of the parties to the\n    original      contract    (hereinafter    called          &quot;the\n    beneficiary&quot;). As to the question of enforcement\n    of the bank guarantee by the beneficiary\n    against the bank, the rights and liabilities are to\n    be governed by the bank guarantee itself and\n    not by the terms and conditions of the original\n    contract. The bank guarantee itself is a contract\n    separate from the original contract pursuant to\n    which the bank guarantee is furnished. The\n    bank is not a party to the original contract.\n    Similarly, the party at whose instance the bank\n    guarantee       is   furnished       pursuant        to    the\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                       - 32 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">agreement, is not a party to the bank guarantee.\nThe bank guarantee is to be enforced if it\ncomplies with the terms and conditions of the\nbank guarantee itself and not when there is any\ndefault or breach of the terms and conditions of\nthe main contract. If the condition for payment\nunder the bank guarantee is fulfilled, then such\npayment is to be made to the beneficiary though\nultimately it may be open to the party at whose\ninstance the bank guarantee was furnished to\nfile a suit for damages against the other parties\nto the contract. It is open to such parties also to\nfile any suit against the bank for recovery of\nany amount, if any, if the bank has acted\ncontrary to the transaction between the bank\nand such other parties. That is no ground for\nholding that the original contract is to be treated\nas part of the guarantee or that the arbitration\nagreement in the original contract can be\nincorporated in the bank guarantee. If the two\ncontracts are separate, the arbitration clause in\nthe original contract cannot be imported in the\ncontract of bank guarantee. In that event, the\narbitration clause in the parent contract cannot\ninclude the question as to whether the terms\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                          - 33 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">and conditions of the bank guarantee have been\nfulfilled.   Whether     the   bank      guarantee   is\nenforceable or not does not depend on the terms\nand conditions of the original contract. In this\nparticular case, Clause (b) as such makes it\nquite clear that the alleged dispute sought to be\nraised therein is the dispute regarding the right\nof the beneficiary under the bank guarantee to\nenforce the bank guarantee as against the\nbank. It has nothing to do with any breach of\ncontract by the beneficiary under the parent\ncontract.    A   claim   arising   out    of   a   bank\nguarantee is not a dispute arising out of the\noriginal contract. As we have pointed out,\nClause (b) as such relates to the right of the\nbeneficiary against the bank on the basis of the\nsaid bank guarantee and not the right of the\nbeneficiary as such against the other party to\nthe contract under the said original contract.\nThe original arbitration agreement may be very\nwide or general in terms, but that certainly does\nnot include a dispute arising under a separate\nagreement with a separate party, that is, the\nbank guarantee and the bank.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">                                - 34 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1087099\" id=\"span_14\">16.   The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1087099/\" id=\"a_40\">Indowind Energy Limited</a>&#x27;s case (supra) has observed\n\nthus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">              &quot;15. Wescare puts forth the agreement\n        dated 24.2.2006 as an agreement signed by\n        the    parties   containing       an   arbitration\n        agreement but the said agreement is signed\n        by    Wescare    and    Subuthi    and   not   by\n        Indowind. It is not in dispute that there can\n        be appointment of an arbitrator if there was\n        any dispute between Wescare and Subuthi.\n        The question is when Indowind is not a\n        signatory to the agreement dated 24.2.2006,\n        whether it can be considered to be a `party&#x27; to\n        the arbitration agreement. In the absence of\n        any document signed by the parties as\n        contemplated under Clause (a) of Sub-Section\n        (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 7</a>, and in the absence of\n        existence of an arbitration agreement as\n        contemplated in Clauses (b) or (c) of Sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">        Section (4) of Section 7 and in the absence of\n        a contract which incorporates the arbitration\n        agreement by reference as contemplated\n        under Sub-Section (5) of Section 7, the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">                           - 35 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">\n     inescapable conclusion is that Indowind is not\n     a party to the arbitration agreement. In the\n     absence of an arbitration agreement between\n     Wescare and Indowind, no claim against\n     Indowind or no dispute with Indowind can be\n     the   subject-   matter   of   reference   to   an\n     arbitrator. This is evident from a plain, simple\n     and normal reading of <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 7</a> of the Act.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">     17.   Much emphasis is placed by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant on the Judgment of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Ananthesh Bhakata\n\n(supra), wherein while examining the issue that when\n\nall the parties are not parties to the retirement\n\ndeed/partnership deed, the court shall not be entitled to\n\nmake the reference relying on the arbitration agreement,\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held that the plaintiffs\n\nadmittedly being parties to the arbitration agreement, it\n\ndoes not lie in their mouth to contend that since some\n\nof the defendants whom they have impleaded was not\n\nparty to the arbitration agreement, no reference can be\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">                           - 36 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">\nmade to the Arbitrator. In the facts of the case, it was\n\nheld that, it cannot be said that merely because one of\n\nthe defendants i.e. defendant No.6 therein was not a\n\nparty to the arbitration agreement, the dispute between\n\nthe parties which essentially relates to the benefits\n\narising out of the retirement deed and partnership deed\n\ncannot be referred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">     18.   In the case of Utkarsh Tubes and Pipes, the\n\nHigh court of Calcutta has held thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     &quot;27. The real cause of action in the plaint is\n     recovery of the price of goods sold and\n     delivered. Under the said agreement, the\n     plaintiff has furnished a bank guarantee.\n     The said bank guarantee is still valid. The\n     bank guarantee is a separate contract. The\n     said contract has nothing to do with the\n     underlying contract of supply of materials\n     under the purchase order. It may have a\n     connection in the sense that the said bank\n     guarantee was furnished as a part of the\n     agreement under which the goods were\n     supplied, but for all intents and purposes, it is\n     a separate contract.       A contract of bank\n     guarantee is to be seen as an independent of\n     the insulate the matter covered thereby from\n     the disputes that may arise under the\n     underlying contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                           - 37 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">     28. The plaintiff can have a separate cause\n     of action against the bank if the bank has\n     acted in breach of the said guarantee or has\n     committed any fraud. The Court has to see\n     the real purpose in joining the bank in this\n     proceeding. The cause of action against the\n     plaintiff No.1 and the cause of action against\n     the plaintiff No.2 are different. The Court can\n     direct a separate trail. The joinder of cause of\n     action or joinder of parties are only enabling\n     provisions. The Court, in my view, having\n     regard to the object of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_43\">Arbitration and\n     Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, in such a situation, is\n     required to find out the real controversy\n     between the parties and if the Court is of the\n     view that the other party has been impleaded\n     in order to avoid arbitration, the Court should\n     ignore such addition and refer the parties to\n     arbitration. In the instant case, I have already\n     held that the real controversy is between the\n     plaintiff and the defendant No.1. The joinder\n     of the defendant No.2 is made obviously to\n     avoid arbitration since the plaintiff perceived\n     bias or impartially in the appointment of an\n     arbitrator under the arbitration clause.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">     19.   In Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. -v- Jayesh\n\nH.Pandya and Another reported in (2003) 5 SCC 531\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held thus:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           &quot;15.   The relevant language used in\n     Section 8 is &quot;in a matter which is the subject\n     matter of an arbitration agreement&quot;, Court is\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                       - 38 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">required to refer the parties to arbitration.\nTherefore, the suit should be in respect of &#x27;a\nmatter&#x27; which the parties have agreed to refer\nand   which   comes      within   the   ambit   of\narbitration agreement. Where, however, a suit\nis commenced - &quot;as to a matter&quot; which lies\noutside the arbitration agreement and is also\nbetween some of the parties who are not\nparties to the arbitration agreement, there is\nno question of application of <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 8</a>.

The next question which requires\nconsideration is even if there is no provision\nfor partly referring the dispute to arbitration,\nwhether such a course is possible under\n<a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 8</a> of the Act? In our view, it would be\ndifficult to give an interpretation to <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 8</a>\nunder which bifurcation of the cause of action\nthat is to say the subject matter of the suit or\nin some cases bifurcation of the suit between\nparties who are parties to the arbitration\nagreement and others is possible.

If bifurcation of\n     the   subject    matter       of   a   suit   was\n     contemplated, the legislature would have\n     used appropriate language to permit such a\n     course.

It is observed that the question\n\nwhich confronts this court is a bit different- the non\n\nparties to the two sets of arbitration agreement are\n\nneither necessary, nor proper for the adjudication of\n\ndisputes. No attempt is made by the plaintiff to show\n\nhow defendant Nos.3, 4 and 5 have any concern or are\n\nconnected with the dispute relating to termination of\n\ncontract, or the dispute with Alstom for its alleged\n\nbreach of terms of the Project agreement.</span> It is held that\n\nin these circumstances, the inescapable inference is\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">                           - 40 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_100\">\nthat they were included in the suit, as defendant, to\n\ncircumvent and possibly to defeat the arbitration clause.\n\nIt is held that so far as adjudication of the two sets of\n\ndisputes i.e. between the plaintiff and Alstom on the one\n\nhand and the plaintiff and NTPC are concerned, none of\n\nthe other defendants i.e. defendant Nos.3, 4 and 5 are\n\nnecessary parties.      It was the case where Bank\n\nguarantee had been encashed and concession was made\n\nto that extent besides this concession, the plaintiff has\n\nnot shown how it had- or can have any cause of action\n\nagainst the Bank.       The plaint was bereft of any\n\naverments concerning the Banks breach of any legal\n\nduty or contractual obligations, or with the encashment\n\nof the Bank guarantee, by NPTC was tainted by fraud.\n\nIn the circumstances, the said Judgment is not\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_101\">     21.

It is not in dispute\n\nthat no arbitration clause is provided in the said Bank\n\nguarantees.        Thus, the Bank Guarantees executed\n\nbetween the appellant and respondent No.2-Bank being\n\na separate contract, no arbitration clause can be\n\ninvoked, placing reliance on clause 21.0 of LOA\n\nreferring to clause 19.0 of GCC.         It is well settled\n\nprinciple   that    arbitration   agreement   between    the\n\nappellant and respondent No.1 cannot be deemed or\n\nconstrued to be an arbitration agreement in respect of\n\nanother guarantor who was not party to the arbitration\n\nagreement. The arbitration agreement as defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/749436/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 7(4)(a)(b)</a> of the Act is sine qua non for invoking\n\nthe arbitration clause.       Indisputably, an arbitration\n\nclause in another document would get incorporated into\n\na contract by reference, provided the contract should\n\ncontend a clear reference to the documents containing\n\narbitration clause and an intention to incorporate the\n\narbitration clause into the contract must be explicit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">                             - 42 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_105\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">     22.
