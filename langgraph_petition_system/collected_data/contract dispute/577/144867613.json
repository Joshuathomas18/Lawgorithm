The applicant participated in the bids and emerged successfully. Ultimately, the parties namely, CMRL and JV entered into a contract dated 18.03.2011. The said Contract is hereinafter called as &#x27;Contract Agreement&#x27;. Pursuant to the Contract Agreement , the applicant furnished Bank Guarantees that are alive as on today, as follows:\n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Bank Guarantee No.ICCI Bank\nValue of the BG\nin Rs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">Date of Expiry\n0393BG00071211/\n0393BG00071011\n        68,86,45,320.00\n                 30.04.2017\n\nBank Guarantee No.(Bank of Baroda)\nValue of the BG\nin Rs.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">Date of Expiry\n291011GPER014911\n            9,32,88,100\n                        30.06.2017\n\nBank Guarantee No.ICCI Bank\nValue of the BG\nin Rs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">Date of Expiry\n039BG00071111/\n039BG00070911\n          62,20,62,230\n             31.07.2017\n0393BG00068314\n            2,00,00,000\n             01.12.2016\n0393BG00068014\n            2,00,00,000\n             01.12.2016\n0393BG00072611\n          31,10,31,115\n             30.06.2017\n\n\t3(iii). The schedule duration for completion of the project was originally fixed as 1521 days from the date of commencement, which is on  02.04.2011. The applicant had mobilised all the required resources and were progressing with the work. However, during the execution of the said works, there were several delays and hindrance that the applicant Company had to face which are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\ta. Delay in handing over of work site\n\tb. Delay in approval of traffic management    \t     plan\n\tc.  Delay in utility diversion works\n\td. Delay in getting permission for                       \t    barricading from traffic department.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">\te.

Delays due to withdrawal of consent to \t     M/s. AGCF\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">l. Delays on account of Extra/ Additional   items of work in utility diversions.\n</blockquote>          \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Therefore, there was a delay in project execution due to the above major impediments, hindrances. Thus, the applicant has sought for interim extension of time for about 208 days through their letter dated 01.06.2012. The CMRL , by their letter dated 09.06.2012 did not consider the request. However, the work continued. The applicant made a second interim extension request through letter dated 10.04.2013 requesting the CMRL to grant cumulative extension of time for 419 days for completion of the project and extend the project completion upto 23.07.2016. After several meetings and persuasion CMRL agreed to tentatively revise the milestone dates and accordingly, the addendum No.I  to the  Contract Agreement was entered into between the parties wherein the applicant was to substantially complete the works for all the three stations as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\ta.

Even after the extension of time as granted supra, the applicant had to again face several hindrances which disturbed the work. The hindrances faced were as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\ta. delay in handing over of work areas.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\tb. additional time required for diverting the unchartered utilities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\tc. Delay due to restriction on working night shifts by the traffic \t\t    authorities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\td. Delay due to change in thickness of entry/ exist D walls by GC\n\te. Delay due to suspension of Government estate station excavation \t    works by GC.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\tf.

Delay in approvals for various proposals by GC.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\tm. Additional time needed on account of additional monsoon seasons    \t     due to prolongation of works. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">Therefore, the applicant had no other option but to seek further extension of time through their letter dated 26.09.2014. However, the CMRL by its letter dated 15.10.2014 refused to consider the request for extension. In the meantime, the applicant invoked Clause 20.3 of the Contract Agreement and sought for consideration of the Dispute Adjudication Board, as per the provisions of the contract so as to settle and resolve the dispute smoothly. First of the letter with such request was addressed on 06.12.2012 and there was no response from the CMRL and reminders were sent on 01.04.2013 and 10.09.2013. Only on 07.11.2013, the CMRL responded by saying that there are impediment in forming the Dispute Adjudication Board and requested to offer the willingness of the applicant to nominate Adjudicator from the panel of Arbitrators from Indian Council for Arbitration. By letter dated 20.11.2013 followed by another letter dated 21.08.2014, the applicant gave consent for the same. Thereafter, the CMRL, by letter dated 15.09.2014 nominated their own employee as sole member of the said Board. This was opposed by the applicant and the respondent was requested to proceed to the next stage of referring the matter to arbitration.\n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\t3(v). In such a scenario, the JV partner namely MMS created various problems and unilaterally suspended their portions of the work. The GAMMON which is a lead partner had issued a default notice to MMS by letter dated 15.11.2014. The applicant informed the CMRL about its intention of step in proposal in case JV partner fails to perform its obligations. The JV partner once again, deserted and abandoned the work and has also vacated the office premises. The Directors of the said partner are all Russians and they traveled back to their home country leaving the applicant and the CMRL in lurch. At this juncture, the CMRL instead of lending its helping hand, has chosen to issue notice seeking to terminate the Contract. At this juncture, the General Consultant of CMRL through letter dated 11.05.2015 directed the applicant to show cause as to why the CMRL should not terminate the Contract. Similar letter was sent again on 15.05.2015. The applicant in response to those letters, informed through their letter dated 18.05.2015 informed  that the tunneling works for Package III was started on 14.05.2015 which establishes willingness of GAMMON to step in expertise to resume the tunnel work.  GAMMON  through letter dated 23.05.2015 requested the CMRL to expedite the step in proposal. The General Consultant of the CMRL through letter dated 28.05.2015 called upon the GAMMON to respond before 29.05.2015 to the notice  to correct issued by the CMRL. It was also indicated therein that until a satisfactory response is given,  the permission for step in would not be given. The GAMMON through letter dated 28.05.2015 indicated a way forward. Similar letter was sent on 5.6.2015 reiterating the earlier stand including the non-payments from the respondent for the tunnel works to the applicant. The General Consultant through their letter dated 08.06.2015 informed that the GAMMON has not demonstrated the technical and financial competence to complete the full scope of works and therefore, informed that CMRL will not consent GAMMON to step in to complete the tunnel works. The GAMMON issued a detail reply on 16.06.2015 reiterating the earlier stand and requested the CMRL to release substantial payments against the commitments made by the applicant to the tune of Rs.100 crores. The CMRL has not paid the certified amount by the General Consultant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">\t\t3(vi). The work could not be completed as per the original schedule and the reasons are not attributable to the applicant as it is evident from the extension of time proposal submitted by the applicant. The respondent has extended the issuance of take over certificate upto 31.03.2016 from the original contract period, viz., 01.06.2015. However, the respondent recovered the entire mobilising advance sanctioned from the bills which was disproportionate to the value of works completed. This being so, the CMRL had in great haste and without considering the GAMMON offer of stepping in rights, issued show cause notice dated 20.06.2015 to terminate the contract. This was replied by the applicant by letter dated 03.07.2015. The applicant also submitted a revised programme through their letter dated 10.07.2015. However, without considering all the above facts and circumstances, the CMRL has terminated the Contract, by letter dated 13.07.2015. The applicant has already completed 63% of the work and termination of contract. At this stage, if the contract is handed over to the third party, the same would cause further delay and also  damage to the property. The applicant would be put to irreparable hardship and injury.\n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\t3(vii). The CMRL, without making the payments of lawful dues payable to the applicant, terminated the contract and are initiating steps for invocation of the Bank Guarantees furnished by the applicant. Therefore, these applications are filed, one set against the invocation of bank guarantees and another set , against the termination of the contract. \n</blockquote>\t\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\t4. The Chennai Metro Rail Limited filed a common counter affidavit in all the above applications. The sum and substance of the contentions of CMRL are as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\t4(i) The CMRL had entered into contract with the Joint Venture consortium of Gammon India Ltd., and Mosmetrostroy. The contract was based on the pre-qualification criteria met by the JV. The applicant as an individual organization did not meet the pre-qualification criteria. Therefore, CMRL recognized only the Joint Venture as the contractor and would continue to recognize only the Joint Venture. As per Clause 8.5(g) of the JV Agreement, only the Supervisory Board (SB) of the JV should take a decision regarding initiation of legal action or Arbitration. No documentary proof is filed before this Court to show the decision taken by the Supervisory Board to file the present application. Therefore, the Application is not maintainable and the same is liable to be dismissed in limini. The Government of Tamil Nadu created a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for implementing the Chennai Metro Rail Project. This SPV named as &quot;Chennai Metro Rail Limited&quot; was incorporated on 03.12.2007 under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_11\">Companies Act</a>. It has now been converted into a Joint Venture of Government of India and Government of Tamil Nadu with 49/51 equity holding. Only firms and joint ventures pre-qualified under the procedure were allowed to bid for the works in July 2010. Finally, based on combination analysis, lowest tender price was selected. In the least cost combination analysis, the Applicant was found to be the lowest bidder for two packages namely UAA-02 and UAA-03. Accordingly, Contract UAA-02 &quot;Design and Construction of Underground Stations at Government Estate, LIC Building and Thousand Lights and Associated Tunnels&quot; at a cost of Rs.918.22 Crores and Contract UAA-03, &quot;Design and Construction of Underground Stations at Gemini, Teynampet, Chamiers Road and Saidapet and Associated Tunnels&quot; at cost of Rs.1014.42 crores were awarded to the applicant. The agreement for the work was signed on 18th March 2011 and work commenced on 2nd April 2011.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\t4(ii).  The JV had been time and again warned about their slow progress and have been advised to improve their productivity by mobilizing additional resources. Though, the JV committed to make improvements, actual mobilization at site never happened as committed. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t4(iii).  There was a  slow progress of work in the part of the applicant in executing of the project and the same is also a factor noted while issuing show cause notice and subsequent termination as per FIDIC terms. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t4(iv). Considering the slow progress of work by the applicant in executing certain work, the Supervisory Board of the JV itself decided to entrust the scope of work for structural works to two  of the bottom-up stations namely Government Estate and Saidapet to their JV partner,  Mosmetrostroy to directly execute the work under their control. This shows that the applicant (the present surviving JV partner who claims step-in right) itself had failed to execute its own scope of work in the initial stage.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">\t4(v). On 21.08.2012, a Resolution was passed by the Supervisory Board, the Board itself recognized the failure on the part of the applicant to produce atleast 140 rings per week with due quality falling within its own scope of work and therefore, decided that this work should be entrusted to  Mosmetrostroy. After having thorough consideration, the board, though initially decided to terminate the contract, has however decided to constitute a sub-committee of the board members for detail review of the matters and suggest way forward.  Sub-Committee held detailed deliberations with CMRL officials and the JV top management. After discussions, JV top management agreed on following actions;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\ta) It has been jointly agreed by JV to entrust the scope of work for structural works of two of the bottom-up stations namely Government estate and Saidapet to their JV partner MMS to directly execute the work under their control.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\tb) JV further agreed to engage other sub-contracting agencies to entrust the structural work of remaining five stations. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">However, M/s. Gammon \u0016 Mosmetrostroy JV again failed to meet with their own commitments and the progress of works continued to suffer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">\t4(vi). During April 2013, JV sought interim extension of time. Extension of time of 304 days and 295 days respectively were awarded on 16.08.2013 to UAA-02 and UAA-03 packages and the key dates were accordingly revised.  Despite the same, the applicant did not show any progress in the works. It has been noticed that JV was consistently failing to adhere to the revised work programmes. The applicant addressed a letter to this respondent seeking for further extension of time for the third time with regard to contract UAA-03. After considering the request of the applicant by the letter dated 20.10.2014, this respondent already granted extension of time upto 31.03.2016 vide letter dated 16.08.2013 and thus this request was not considered. The JV inspite of being given chances to devise an adoptable strategy to recover all delays accrued, was unable to demonstrate its ability to complete the works even as per the revised schedule.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">\t4(vii). Having regard to the time left over, it is highly impossible for the applicant to complete atleast the station work on or before 31.03.2016. So far, the applicant has completed the station work to an extent of 45%. By the letter dated 07.11.2013, the applicant was called upon to convey its willingness to appoint adjudicator from the panel of Arbitrators maintained by Indian Council of Arbitration for want of Adjudicators in the Indian Council for arbitration. This respondent nominated its member and the same was communicated to the applicant on 15.09.2014. Having agreed that the dispute can be referred for arbitration, the applicant did not accept the member nominated by this respondent. The major expertise in Tunneling works and technical know-how for this contract was provided by M/s. OJSC Mosmetrostroy. M/s. Mosmetrostroy ceased all operations in site for three months between September and December 2014. The highlight of all these failures came on 30.04.2015 when the JV partner, M/s. Mosmetrostroy abandoned the Contracts without fully discharging their duties. The applicant ought to have completed the works under the contract by March 2015. On 27.01.2015, the applicant addressed a letter to this respondent undertaking to complete the work under Package UAA-03 by June, 2016. While sending the reply on 03.07.2015 to the show cause notice dated 20.06.2015, the applicant came forward with a new case that it will complete the construction under the packages UAA-03 and UAA-04 by December 2017. Since the applicant did not have the where withal to proceed with the works, and more particularly, in the absence of any expertise in tunneling works and coupled with the fact of abandonment of the project by M/s.Mosmetrostroy, this respondent was compelled to act in accordance with the contract Provisions. On 20.06.2015, a detailed show cause notice was issued to the  applicant to show cause as to why the contract should not be terminated on the expiry of 14 days.  On 03.07.2015, the applicant sent a reply to the show cause notice. The reply was duly considered by this respondent and by the proceedings dated 13.07.2015, order of termination was issued terminating the contract. \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">\t4(viii). After the contract was terminated, on 14.07.2015, the applicant made a mention as to the receipt of the copy of letter of intent issued by M/s. SELI OVERSEAS, a Italy based company for the purpose of carrying out the tunneling works. Even in the communication dated 16.06.2015, issued by the applicant, there was no mention by the applicant expressing its intention to execute the balance tunneling works though the Italian company. Further, in view of the fact that the termination of contract has been given effect to, the same is no longer available to the applicant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\t4(ix). This respondent has extended funds in the form of special advances to the tune of Rs. 80 crores to the JV to fund their site operations and these payments have been made even though there is no provision in the contract. Some payments were released directly to the vendors whose list was furnished by the JV. As adequate resources were not pumped in by the JV, even after provision of special advances, the works did not gain adequate momentum required to complete the works as per revised schedule.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">\t4(x). The fact remains that the contract has been terminated by the letter dated 13.07.2015 and the same was given effect to. Whereas, the application invoking <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 was filed only on 15.07.2015. In those circumstances, the question of staying the order of termination does not arise. Thus, the reliefs sought for in Application Nos. 4685 and 4686 of 2015 has become infructuous. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">\t4(xi). The contract is independent of the Bank Guarantee. Further, the Bank Guarantees are not conditional. With regard to the Bank Guarantee issued by Bank of Baroda, which is the subject matter of O.A. No. 732 of 2015, the same was given against the Mobilisation Advance in the year 2011 and not as stated in Para 37 of the affidavit. The validity of the Bank Guarantee has expired and hence, this respondent did not take any action to invoke the Bank Guarantee. Hence the allegations to the contrary are denied.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">\t4(xii). Already, there has been substantial delays in the commissioning of Corridor 1 on account of the UAA-02 and 03 contracts which has led CMRL to schedule the revenue operations as late as August 2016 against the planned completion by mid 2015. By delaying the protect further, the date of restoration of roads and handing over to the highways department would be delayed further.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">\t4(xiii). The balance of convenience lies in favour of this respondent because the relief sought for by the applicant can be compensated by way of money if the Arbitrator holds that the termination is not valid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">\t5. The applicant filed a common rejoinder affidavit and a common rejoinder additional affidavit wherein they have reiterated the contentions already raised in the affidavit filed in support of the applications. Both sides have also filed their written submissions. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\t6. Based on the above pleadings of the respective parties and submissions made on behalf of them, the following issues arise for consideration in these applications:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\t(a) Whether the applications filed for interim injunction restraining the Chennai Metro Rail Limited from invoking the respective Bank Guarantees are maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\t(b) If the answer to the above question(a) is in affirmative, whether under the facts and circumstances of the case, the Chennai Metro Rail Limited is to be restrained from invoking or negotiating or receiving any amount in the respect of the subject matter Bank Guarantees,  pending disposal of the arbitral proceedings.    \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\t(c) Whether the applicants in Application Nos. 4685 and 4686 of 2015 are entitled for stay of the operation of the order of termination dated 13.07.2015 passed by the Chennai Metro Rail Limited.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">\t7. I have heard both sides at length. I have given careful consideration to the pleadings, submissions and case laws made, submitted and relied on by the respective parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\t8. O.A.Nos.731, 732 and 734 of 2015 are filed for an order of interim injunction restraining the Chennai Metro Rail Limited from invoking the Bank Guarantees referred to in the respective applications. Insofar as these applications are concerned, the respondents have raised a preliminary objection with regard to the maintainability of these applications under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">\t9. The sum and substance of the objections against the maintainability of these applications are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\tThe subject matter of Bank Guarantees are independent contracts and unless a specific arbitration clause is mentioned in the bank guarantee or a clear reference to the Arbitration clause contained in other supplementary contract between the parties is made therein, <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 9</a> of the said Act cannot be invoked by the parties to the Bank Guarantees. It is their case that the subject matter of Bank Guarantees, not containing the arbitration clause, cannot be called for in question before this Court by invoking <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 9</a> of the above said Act. It is their further case that apart from not reflecting any arbitration clause, the subject matter Bank Guarantees also do not refer to any arbitration clause in any contract between the parties.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\t10. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_1\">In support of the above said submission, the learned Advocate General appearing for the Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. strongly relied on a decision of the learned  Single Judge reported in 2013(<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_17\">3) CTC 414 Befesa Agua v. IVRCL Infrastructure and Project Ltd.

It is their further case that the GAMMON India Limited is not authorised to file these applications independently when the contract was entered by CMRL on one side and GAMMON and OJSC Mosmetrostory JV on the other side. Thus, it is contended by them that either GAMMON or MMS severally be construed and recognised as parties to the said Contract independently. It is their further case that the above applications could have been filed only with the approval and consent of MMS which is mandatory in terms of Clause 8.5(g) of th Joint Venture Agreement and in the absence of the same, these applications are not maintainable.\t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">\t12. It is their further contention that even to initiate process of arbitration against the employer namely CMRL, the presence of both parties, namely GAMMON and MMS is essential. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">\t13. Further, it is contended that  the Contract between the parties is determinable in nature, as both parties can terminate the Contract at their instance, as per <a href=\"/doc/1400696/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 14(1)</a> of the Specific Relief Act. Such contract which is  in nature  determinable, cannot be specifically enforced and as per <a href=\"/doc/1436285/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 41</a> of the Specific Relief Act and consequently,  no injunction  can be granted in such matters. Therefore, on this ground also, the applications are not maintainable. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">\t14. Per contra, the sum and substance of the submissions made by the learned  senior counsels appearing on behalf of the applicants, insofar as the issue with regard to the maintainability is concerned, are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_2\">14(i) There is no dispute that the documents referred under Clause 2 of the Contract Agreement shall be deemed to be read and construed as part of the said agreement. One of such document is the \u0013guarantee with the system\u0014  and format of the Bank Guarantee is also given by the CMRL. The Bank Guarantee also specifically recites about the contract in it. Therefore, the Bank Guarantee cannot be separated from the main contract and it has to be treated as part and parcel of the main Contract. The Bank Guarantees are independent only to the extend that it is given by the Bank in favour of the beneficiaries. However, it is linked to the performance of the work and contract.  The decision of the learned single Judge reported in 2013(<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_20\">3) CTC 414 Befesa Agua v. IVRCL Infrastructure and Project Ltd.</a> are factually distinguishable and cannot be applied to the facts and circumstances of the present case. Reliance of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court decision reported in 2009(7) SCC 696 (M.R.Engineers and Contracts Pvt.Ltd. v.

Therefore<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_21\">, <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_22\">the said decision</a></a> will not help the CMRL in any manner.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_3\">In any event, the decision made in 2013(3) CTC 414 (<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_23\">Befesa Agua v.

MMS was deemed to be in material breach under clause 19.1 of JV Agreement. The supervisory Board consists of two members, one member from each party and the member appointed by lead party is the Chairman of the Board. The Supervisory Board  is mainly for deciding all the matters of primary importance and such exercise is not required, when one party commits material breach as the supervisory board is inter se between the parties. Clause 19.4 (a) of JV Agreement permits removal of defaulting party. The intention of getting approval of CMRL for removal of default party and step in rights is related to only for carrying out the defaulting parties work by competent agency. Clause 19.5 stipulates that defaulting party shall seize to have any further decision making authority. The JV Agreement provides for removal of defaulting party and hence, JV agreement subsists even without the  non defaulting party. Consequently, the contract between CMRL and JV also subsists. Clause 8.5(a) of JV agreement is not operational, since MMS abandoned the work and committed material breach. Clause 20.2 of JV agreement deals with termination of JV agreement. Such termination will take effect only on certain events to happen. As per the above said clause, JV agreement stands to be terminated only when all of the events mentioned therein had taken place. There is no prohibition in the JV agreement against non-defaulting party in approaching the remedy available in the main contract.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">\t15.

It is a fact that all other Bank Guarantees involved in these applications are also similar in nature with the very same Clauses.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">\t24. Based on these factual aspects of the matter, let me now consider the maintainability issue. \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">\t25. Indisputably, the Joint Venture Agreement entered into between the GAMMON  and MMS forms part of the contract agreement dated 18.03.2011 entered between the Joint Venture and Chennai Metro Rail Limited. This is evident from Clause 2 of the Contract Agreement which states that several documents referred to therein including the Joint Venture Agreement shall be deemed to form and be read and construed as part of the Contract Agreement. Apart from showing Joint Venture Agreement  as part of the Contract Agreement, the &quot;Guarantee for the system&quot; is also shown as one of the documents as referred to as the documents deemed to form and be read and construed as part of the Contract Agreement.  Therefore, it is evident that neither this Joint Venture agreement nor the document given as Guarantee for the system can be treated as independent document without having any connection whatsoever with the Contract Agreement. By specifically referring those documents as part of the Contract Agreement, it is evident that the parties to the agreement are fully conscious of their intention in making those documents also as part and parcel of the Contract Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">\t26. Clause 13 of the Joint Venture agreement deals with bonds and guarantees wherein it is contemplated that the Joint Venture shall provide with Guarantees, bonds and securities, etc., in connection with the Contract. Therefore, it is evident that the Bank Guarantee executed by the Joint Venture, admittedly, in respect of the Contract which is the subject matter ofContract Agreement dated 18.03.2011, has emerged as per the terms of the Joint Venture, namely, Clause 13.1  followed by the Contract Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\t27. A perusal of the terms and conditions of the Bank Guarantee furnished by the respective Banks, which are referred to supra, would establish the fact that they were furnished only in connection with the contract awarded by the CMRL in favour of the Joint Venture, more particularly, in respect of the specific work of the Contract. It cannot be, therefore, said that those Bank Guarantees are furnished as an independent act by the bank or by the guarantor  as an action totally unconnected with the Contract Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">\t28. Thus, I am of the considered view that the JV Agreement, the Contract Agreement and Bank Guarantee, are interlinked with each other and therefore, it cannot be said that such Bank Guarantee furnished by the respective Banks is to be treated as an independent Contract.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">\t29. Admittedly, when  furnishing of such Bank Guarantee is a mandatory obligation under or in respect of the Contract entered into between the parties, it goes without saying  they are not independent Contracts as contended by the CMRL. Once, it is found that they are not independent Contracts, it follows that the guarantor/ contractor  to the Contract Agreement is entitled to seek interim relief against invocation of the Bank Guarantee by invoking <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act before this Court, in case of any dispute that has arisen between the parties which has to be settled by the Arbitral Tribunal. \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">\t30. In fact, the Bank Guarantees are meant to safeguard the interest of the person in whose favour such guarantee is issued at the instance of a person in whose favour the work is assigned. In other words, in these type of cases, the Bank Guarantee is issued at the instance of the Guarantor/ Contractor  to the beneficiary/ employer. The invocation of the Bank Guarantee so furnished, depends upon various facts and circumstances  of each case and the terms and conditions stipulated in the Contract between the parties. Therefore, in pursuant to any dispute, if the employer has chosen to invoke the bank guarantee, certainly,  the other party is entitled to question the same  before  the Court by invoking <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act when it is an admitted fact that such Contract Agreement between the parties contains the Arbitration Clause. No doubt, whether the guarantor is entitled to get any protection under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_26\">section 9</a> of the said Act is to be considered and decided based upon facts and circumstances of each case.  In this case, I have already extracted the relevant arbitration clause referred to in the Contract Agreement. When such being the position, the employer, namely CMRL, after terminating the contract, if  makes an attempt to invoke the Bank Guarantee, certainly, the JV can maintain an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 9</a> of the said Act to restrain the CMRL from invoking those bank guarantees. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">\t31. In fact the above clauses referred in the Bank guarantee would only indicate that the Bank cannot refuse to perform its part of the obligations under the Bank Guarantee when it is sought to be invoked by citing a reason that  any suit or other legal proceedings including the arbitral proceedings are pending between the guarantor  and the beneficiary. However, in my considered view, such Clause will not debar or prohibit the guarantor  from seeking a protection  order from the Court by invoking the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_28\">section 9</a> of the said Act restraining the employer from invoking the bank guarantee,  provided if he can able to establish that such invocation either before or during or after the arbitral proceedings would cause &quot;irretrievable injury or injustice&quot; to him. In other words, the prohibition contained in the said clause is only against the Bank and not against the Guarantor.  Whether the CMRL is entitled to  invoke  the Bank guarantee or not is another question which has to be decided on merits, which I will deal in the latter part of this order. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_87\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_4\">32. The decision  reported in 2013(<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_29\">3) CTC 414 Befesa Agua v. IVRCL Infrastructure and Project Ltd.   (R.S.Ramanathan,J</a>) is strongly relied on by the learned Advocate General appearing for the CMRL in support of his contention that in the absence of Arbitration clause in the Bank Guarantee, the arbitration clause mentioned in the Contract Agreement cannot be  read into  the bank guarantee so as to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 9</a> of the said Act.  First of all, it is seen that <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_31\">the said decision</a> of the learned Single Judge is  now the  subject matter of challenge before the Division Bench of this Court in O.S.A.No.177 of 2013 etc.  and the  Division Bench of this Court by its order dated 16.04.2013 granted interim injunction restraining the 3rd respondent therein from remitting any money pursuant to the demand notice in reference to the subject matter of the bank guarantee therein and the said interim order is extended until further orders and is said to be in force. Even otherwise, from the perusal of the facts and circumstances of <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_32\">the above case</a>,  it is seen that they are totally different and distinguishable. It is seen <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_33\">in that case</a> that the first respondent and the first applicant therein  jointly formed a Joint Venture and consequently, they incorporated the second respondent therein as a special purpose vehicle to undertake the project from the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. It is further seen that the 2nd respondent therein consequently, entered into an agreement with CMWSSB and entered a bulk water purchase agreement. In pursuant to entering into such bulk water purchase agreement, the second respondent therein sub-contracted the work to 2nd and 3rd applicants therein by way of entering into separate agreement. Under the project contracts, the applicants therein were obliged to submit the bank guarantee in favour of the 2nd respondent and accordingly, they submitted the bank guarantee. Under those  circumstances, it was contended therein that the bank guarantees furnished are distinct and separate agreement entered into between the applicants and the respondents 1 and 2 therein as they do not contain any arbitration clause and consequently, the application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_34\">section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot be maintained for the purpose of determining the dispute arising under such Bank Guarantee. Based on the above stated facts and circumstances and by following the decision of the Apex Court reported in 2009(7) SCC 696 (M.R.Engineers and Contracts Pvt.Ltd. v. Som Datt Builders Ltd.,) the learned Judge found that the arbitration clauses cannot be incorporated with the Bank Guarantees therein since mere reference to the original contract will not make the arbitration clause be read into Bank Guarantees.</span> \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_5\">33. Thus, from a perusal of the discussion made by the learned Judge and the facts and circumstances of <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_35\">the above case</a> would show that they are not similar to the facts of the present case. I have already discussed about  Clause 2 of the Contract Agreement specifically stating that document of &quot;guarantee for the system&quot; and &quot;Joint Venture Agreement&quot; along with other documents referred to therein are deemed to form part of the Contract Agreement.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_6\">I do not think that any similar Clause was there in the Contract Agreement in the above referred <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_36\">Befesa</a>&#x27;s case.</span>\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_7\">34. I have also referred to Clause 13 of the Joint Venture Agreement dealing with furnishing of Bank Guarantee by the Joint Venture.  I have also referred to the relevant Bank Guarantees issued by the Bank specifically referring  the subject matter Contract Agreement entered into between the parties. When that being the factual position in the present case, it cannot be said that merely because the Bank Guarantee does not contain the arbitration clause, the same cannot be prevented from getting invoked by invoking the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 9</a> of the said Act. Once, the parties have specifically agreed that the Joint Venture Agreement and the guarantee for the system apart from the other documents referred to therein under Clause 2  of the Contract Agreement is to   form part of the contract agreement and to be read and construed as part of the said agreement, it automatically follows that the arbitration clause contained in the contract agreement has to read into the Bank Guarantee and hence,  they cannot be heard to say that the Bank Guarantee is an independent contract and cannot be put to challenge against its invocation as there is no specific arbitration clause therein. When these are all distinct and different facts of the present case, I do not think that <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_38\">the above decision</a> of the learned single Judge (R.S.Ramanathan, J) is helping the respondents in any manner as the facts of that case followed by such decision are on different footing.</span>\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">\t35. The Honourable Supreme Court as well as the High Court in very many decisions have considered as to what constitutes precedent and observed that a decision is a precedent on its own fact and each case presents it own feature and relying on such decision without looking into the factual  background of the case before the Court is clearly impermissible. It is also well settled that even one additional  or different fact may make a world of difference between the conclusions arrived at in two cases. The following decisions are relevant to be quoted for the above said proposition.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">\t(a) In (2008) 1 MLJ 501 (SC), Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Raj Kumari, the Honourable Supreme Court has held in paragraph Nos.12, 13 and 15 as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">\tReliance on the decision without looking into the factual background of the case before it is clearly impermissible.  A decision is a precedent on its own facts.  Each case presents its own features.  It is not everything said by a Judge while giving a judgment that constitutes a precedent.  The only thing in a Judge&#x27;s decision binding a party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason it is important to analyse a decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi.  According to the well-settled theory of precedents, every decision contains three basic postulates: &quot; (i) findings of material facts, direct and inferential.  An inferential finding of facts is the inference which the Judge draws from the direct, or perceptible facts; (ii) statements of the principles of law applicable to the legal problems disclosed by the facts; and (iii) judgment based on the combined effect of the above.  A decision is an authority for what it actually decides.  What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein nor what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">.....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">.....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">\tCourts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed.

No doubt there are two decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court Court one reported in   2008 (13) SCC 658 (<a href=\"/doc/1432379/\" id=\"a_43\">Bharat Karasondas Thakkar Vs.

Paras Finance Co., Mankanwar  and others</a> (2007 (10) SCC 82) expressing two different views. In this aspect,  my considered view is that  for the application of binding precedents,  the facts of each case  has to be seen  and only after considering  and satisfying with the similarity of those facts with that of the facts of the  case on hand, the <a href=\"/doc/324107/\" id=\"a_45\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/324107/\" id=\"a_46\">laid down in</a></a> such decision can be applied as a binding precedent.</span></span>     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"623061\" id=\"span_14\">In fact  the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in a decision reported in  2003 (2) SCC  111 (<a href=\"/doc/623061/\" id=\"a_47\">Bhavnagar University Vs.

Further,  the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court  in a decision reported in 2006 (3 ) SCC 434 (Bombay Dyeing &amp; Mfg. Co.

An order of this Court, it is well known, must be construed having regard to the text and context in which the same was passed.  For the said purpose, the orders of this Court were required to be read in their entirety. A judgment, it is well settled, cannot be read as a statute.  (See <a href=\"/doc/1510498/\" id=\"a_48\">Sarat Chandra Mishra Vs. State of  Orissa</a> (2006 SCC (L&amp;S) 182 and State of Karnataka Vs.C.Lalitha (2006 (2) SCC 747). Construction  of a judgment, it is well settled should be made in the light of the factual  matrix involved therein.  What is more important  is to see the issues involved  therein and the context wherein the observations were made.

On consideration of the law <a href=\"/doc/1510498/\" id=\"a_49\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the above said decisions reported in 2003 (2) SCC 111 (<a href=\"/doc/623061/\" id=\"a_50\">Bhavnagar University Vs. Palitana Sugar  Mills Pvt. Ltd.</a>, ) as well as 2006 (3) SCC 434 (Bombay Dyeing &amp; Mfg. Co. Ltd.,(3) Vs.Bombay Environmental Actin Group and Others), what follows is that to apply the precedential value of  a particular decision,  one has to  see the facts and circumstances  of the particular case and only when the said facts and circumstances  of that particular case are identically similar  to that of the facts and circumstances of the case on hand, the decision made in the said case can be considered as a binding precedent.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"324107\" id=\"span_17\">By applying  the said principle,  I find the decision rendered in 2007 (10) SCC 82 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/324107/\" id=\"a_51\">Sumtibai &amp; Others Vs.

Thus, it is clear that a decision can become a binding precedent only when the facts and circumstances of such case are similar to and identical with that of the case on hand.

Som Datt Builders Ltd.,) in support of his conclusion. A perusal of the above said decision of the Apex Court would show once again  that the facts and circumstances of that case are totally different and distinguishable. In that case, before the Honourable Supreme Court, it is seen that PWD of Kerala Government entrusted works to one Som Datt Builders, the respondent before the Apex Court. The agreement between the PWD and Som Datt Builders had arbitration clause. However, Som Datt Builders sub-contracted certain works to M.R. Engineers which contained a clause that sub-contract shall be carried out on terms and conditions as applicable in the main contract. When dispute has  arisen between Som Datt Builders and the sub-contractor, an Application under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act came to be filed by the sub-contractor  relying upon the principal contract between PWD and Som Datt Builders. In that scenerio, the  Honourable Supreme Court has found that the working of the sub-contract disclose only the intention to incorporate by reference to the terms of the main contract and the arbitration clause in the main contract did not form part of the sub-contract between the parties.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_19\">But, in the case on hand, presence of clause 2 of Contract Agreement makes a world of difference  and hence<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_55\">, <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_56\">the above decision</a></a> of the Apex Court followed by the learned single Judge in <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_57\">Befesa</a>&#x27;s case, also does not help the respondents in any manner.</span> \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_20\">38.

On the other hand<a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_59\">, <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_60\">the said decision</a></a> came to be rendered considering the merits of the case to reject the application filed under 39 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_61\">Rule 1 of C.P.C</a>. read with <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 9</a> of the said Act seeking for injunction restraining the respondents therein from invoking the Bank Guarantee.

On the other hand an unreported decision of  a learned Single Judge of this Court made in O.A.No.221 of 2014 dated 30.04.2015 is cited on behalf of the applicant to contend that for the purpose of deciding as to whether the terms of the main contract including the arbitration clause are applicable to the bank guarantee, it is necessary to refer to the main contract.  The learned Judge held at Paragraph No.13 and 21 as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">\t&quot;13.It cannot be disputed that the bank guarantee is a separate and distinct contract.  When the bank guarantee is invoked, the banker has no option, but to disburse the amount.  However, it is to be noted that the origin of the bank guarantee is based on the contract between the two parties, to which bank is not a party.  For the purpose of deciding as to whether the terms of the main contract including the arbitration clause are applicable to the bank guarantee, it is necessary to refer to the main contract, that is the Letter of Intent entered into between the parties and the bank guarantees..\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">\t..21. As held by the Honourable Supreme Court, the Section empowers the court to grant such interim measures of protection, by use of the words Just and Convenient.  It is to be noted here that the courts, while hearing an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, are empowered to grant prohibitory orders against a garnishee, even though the third party, against whom the relief is sought for, is not a party to the arbitration agreement, as the relief is in the nature of securing the claim of the applicants, if the requirements under Civil Procedure Code for grant of interim orders are satisfied.  It is also pertinent to mention here that the applicant has approached this Court before the invocation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_21\">40. After relying on the above said decision, the learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the above said decision being the latest one, the same has to be relied on in preference to the decision made by R.S.Ramanathan,J. in <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_65\">Befesa Ajua</a> case.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1064096\" id=\"span_22\">For that proposition, they relied on <a href=\"/doc/1064096/\" id=\"a_66\">AIR 2003 Karnataka 456, Karnataka STate Road Transport Corporation, Bangalore vs R.Maheswari</a>, wherein the Full Bench of Karnataka High Court held at paragraph No.22 as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"152574308\" id=\"span_23\">&quot;22.The argument of learned counsel M.R.A.Achar is that in the later decision, the earlier decision was not followed.  The controversy is not acceptable as it is well settled law of precedent that where there are two judgments rendered by the Benches consisting of equal number of Judges as in this case, the later in time would prevail and hence we are bound by the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_67\">R.Venkatesham Chetty</a>&#x27;s case <a href=\"/doc/152574308/\" id=\"a_68\">referred to above</a>.

Another contention raised by CMRL against the maintainability of the applications against invoking of Bank guarantee, is that the GAMMON cannot maintain the applications individually as admittedly, MMS is not in the picture and abandoned  the contract. Therefore, it is their contention that  in the absence of MMS, joint venture does not exist and consequently,  GAMMON cannot maintain these applications. I am not able to  accept the above contention. First of all,  it is to be seen that these applications are not filed by GAMMON in its individual capacity but by the joint venture itself. In other words, these applications are filed not by GAMMON alone but by joint venture. Whether joint venture exists even after MMS abandoned the contract is not a simple question to be answered  in negative simply by considering the above stated position alone. On the other hand, existence of joint venture, even after exist of MMS need to be considered and decided by considering clause 19 which deals with default of a party; Clause 19.7 which gives the right to other party to  retain all assets of plants, equipments and material provided by the joint venture for the completion of the works; Clause 19.11 which deals with step-in rights of the lead party; Clause 20.2 contemplating as to at what point of time the joint venture agreement stands terminated. Therefore, all these clauses in the joint venture agreement are very much crucial and essential clauses for deciding whether the joint  venture exists even after one party abandons. A perusal of those clauses, prima facie indicate that the contention of the CMRL is not correct. Therefore, the above clauses certainly, have to be construed as showing  prima facie case in favour of the applicant for grant of interim order against invoking of Bank Guarantee.  Therefore, the above contention raised by CMRL cannot be sustained. \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">\t42. Another objection raised by CMRL against maintainability is that there is no resolution passed by the Supervisory Board of the Joint Venture to file the case before this Court. It is their contention that when the Board consists of both GAMMON and MMS, the GAMMON alone cannot take a decision and file these applications in the absence of MMS. I am not able to appreciate the said contention since the Supervisory Board as contemplated under Clause 8 of the Joint Venture Agreement consists of two members, one appointed by each party and the member appointed by lead party shall act as a chairman of the Supervisory Board. Further, Clause 8.7 contemplates that if quorum is not achieved or if a quorum  again in the adjourned meeting is not achieved, the decision shall be taken by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in a bonafide manner. Therefore, in view of the above said Clause dealing with the Supervisory Board, it cannot be said that the GAMMON being the lead party and also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is powerless to question against any action of the employer in respect of the contract entered into between the parties. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">\t43. Therefore, I answer the first issue in affirmative by holding  that  these applications seeking for injunction to restrain the CMRL from  invoking  the Bank Guarantee  are  maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 9</a> of  the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">\t44. As I have found the first question regarding the maintainability of the applications in affirmative holding that they are maintainable, now I need to examine the other two questions which are on merits.\t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">\t44.  Before answering these questions, let me first consider the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">\t9. Interim measures, etc., by Court \u0016 A party may, before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award but before it is enforced in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1282684/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 36</a>, apply to a Court :-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">\t(i) for the appointment of a guardian for a minor or a person of unsound mind for he purposes of arbitral proceedings; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">\t(ii) for an interim measure of protection in respect of any of the following matters, namely:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">\t(a) the preservation, interim custody or sale of any goods which are the subject-matter of the arbitration agreement;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">\t(b) securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">\t(c) the detention, preservation or inspection of any property or thing which is the subject-matter of the dispute of arbitration, or as to which any question may arise therein and authorising for any of the aforesaid purposes  any person to enter upon any land or building in the possession of any party or authorising any samples to be taken or any observation to be made or experiment to be tried, which may be necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full information or evidence;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">\t(d) interim injunction or the appointment of a receiver;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">\t(e) such other interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient,\nand the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of, and in relation to, any proceedings before it.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">\t45. A perusal of the above said provision of law would show that it is intended only for the purpose of providing some interim relief or measures by Court to a party  before or during or after arbitral  proceedings  but before the award  is enforced in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1282684/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 36</a>. In other words, it could be seen that the Court which exercise the power under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_75\">section 9</a> is not deciding the main dispute between the parties in any manner and on the other hand, it is only to provide an interim measure of protection as may appear to the Court to be just and convenient apart from other purposes as stipulated under sub-clause 1 and 2 of <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 9</a>. Needles to say that a party who comes to the Court to invoke its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 9</a>, undoubtedly, comes with a hue and cry seeking for interim protection either before or during or after arbitral proceedings. When the main dispute between the parties has to be decided only in the arbitral proceedings and the scope of interference with such award by the Court is contemplated  only when an application is filed under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 34</a> of the said Act, exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 9</a> for providing some interim relief or measures, is to be construed only as a balancing act and not as a a damaging or decisive act on merits. In other words, the approach of the Court while exercising the power under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 9</a> must be in the form of first- aid, provided, the party who seeks  such interim measure has made out a prima facie case for getting such treatment. As the party who approaches the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 9</a> has already suffered some injury at the hands of the other side and  the merits of which has to be decided ultimately under the arbitral proceedings, the Court should, in a given facts and circumstances of the case, at this stage, find out a via media between both parties so that interest of both parties is protected. Especially, in  cases where the arbitral proceedings is yet to commence, the role of the Court, as far as possible, is only to preserve the subject matter of Arbitration Agreement and protect the interest of both parties by way of passing a balancing order, as the merits of the dispute arising out of the arbitration agreement yet is to be considered and decided by the arbitral proceedings. At the same time, it should not be taken to mean that in all cases under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 9</a>, such exercise need to be done. As I have already stated the facts and circumstancesthe case should satisfy the Court that exercise need to be made in the interest of both parties. Keeping this principle in mind, let me consider the facts and circumstances of the present case to find out as to whether the applicant is entitled to the interim orders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">\t46. Admittedly, the subject matter of Bank Guarantees are sought to be invoked as a consequential action resulting out of the order of termination dated 13.07.2015 passed by the CMRL against the applicant. It is also not in dispute that as against the order of termination, the aggrieved party can raise a dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal, in view of the fact that the Contract Agreement entered into between the parties provides an arbitration clause, which I have already extracted supra. Though both sides have elaborately made their respective pleadings and submissions on merits for and against the termination of Contract  by inviting this Court&#x27;s attention to various facts and circumstances as well as various clauses contained in the Joint Venture Agreement as well as in the Contract Agreement, I am not inclined to go into  those aspects and give a finding as to whether the termination is valid or not, since such issue is for the Arbitral Tribunal to consider and decide on merits. Therefore, if any observation or finding, even by way of passing reference, is made in this order on the merits of the order of termination, the same  would not only prejudice the mind of Arbitral Tribunal and also virtually result in the Arbitral Proceedings an empty formality. Therefore, I find that all the points raised before this Court by both the parties regarding the merits of the termination of Contract are to be raised and agitated only before the Arbitral Tribunal. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">\t47. Application Nos.4685 and 4686 of 2015 are filed seeking for stay of termination order. It is seen from the order of termination dated 13.07.2015 that the termination takes effect from the date of the said order, which means that  the termination has already taken place from 13.07.2015 onwards. I have already pointed out as to whether the termination of the contract is valid or not is the question that has to be considered and decided only in the arbitral proceedings and this Court, at this stage, that too, while considering the application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 9</a> of the said Act, cannot go into the validity or otherwise of the order of termination and  give its finding on the same. Therefore, the question of staying the termination order also does not arise, more particularly, when the order of termination has already given effect to. On the other hand, if the termination is stayed, it would amount to revival of  the contract between the parties. In effect, even before the Arbitral Tribunal decides the dispute, granting of stay of termination would indirectly result in deciding the matter in favour of the applicant,  even though if it is sought for as an interim measure. Hence, I do not propose to do such exercise as I consider that the validity of termination is the main dispute which to be agitated before the Arbitration Tribunal. \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1737629\" id=\"span_25\">48. The learned Advocate General Mr.A.L.Somayaji appearing for the respondents relied on <a href=\"/doc/1737629/\" id=\"a_84\">AIR 2000 Delhi 450, Rajasthan Breweries Limited v. Stoh Brewery Company</a>, in support of his contention that the contract specifically determinable cannot be specifically enforced.  In paragraph No.14 of <a href=\"/doc/1737629/\" id=\"a_85\">the above decision</a>, it has been observed as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">\t&quot;14. The effect of breach of a contract by a party seeking to specifically enforce the contract under the Indian law is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 16(c)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1221024/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 41(e)</a> of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.  Clause (e) of <a href=\"/doc/1436285/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 41</a> of the Specific Relief Act provides that injunction cannot be granted to prevent the breach of contract, the performance of which would not be specifically enforced.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">\t49. In the case on hand, the contract between the parties is already terminated. Whether such termination is valid or not has to be gone into and decided only in the arbitral proceedings.  Therefore, the question as to whether the contract is specifically determinable and consequently, the same cannot be specifically enforced, is a question that would arise for consideration before the arbitral proceedings and therefore, this Court, at this stage, is not to decide such issue.  Accordingly, I decide the question in respect of stay of termination of the contract  against the applicant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_108\">\t50. The next question is as to whether the respondents are entitled to invoke the Bank Guarantee in pursuant to the order of termination. No doubt, the bank guarantee sought to be invoked is a consequential action  pursuant to the order of termination. It is also true that the Bank Guarantee furnished contains a clause that the Bank shall pay to the employer any money so demanded notwithstanding any dispute or disputes raised by the Contractor in any suit or proceedings pending before any Court or Tribunal or Arbitrator/s relating thereto and the liable under this guarantee shall be absolute and unequivocal. Therefore, it is contended  by the respondent that they are entitled to invoke the bank guarantee. \t\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_109\">\t51. Per contra, the learned senior counsels appearing on the side of the applicant contended that while the applicant is entitled to challenge the termination of contract before the Arbitral Tribunal by raising very many grounds on merits as contended herein, they are entitled to get protection from this Court, in the meantime,  as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 9</a> of the said Act to preserve the subject matter of dispute during the pendency of the Arbitral proceedings. Therefore, it is contended by the learned senior counsel, staying the termination order and passing an order of injunction preventing the CMRL from invoking the Bank guarantee is essential and imminent, so as to preserve the subject matter of dispute during the pendency of the arbitral proceedings.  I have already found that staying of termination cannot be granted as it has already been given effect to and if stay is granted, it would amount to reviving the contract itself. Preserving the subject matter does not mean restoring the parties to their original position that existed before the termination. Therefore, I am of the view that the applicants  are not justified in seeking for the stay of termination order. However, insofar as the invocation of bank guarantee is concerned, it has to be seen as to whether the applicants are entitled to protection by way of passing an interim order of injunction. \t\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">\t52. In this case, the GAMMON and MMS became a Joint Venture and entered into Contract Agreement with the CMRL. It is seen that while executing the work and after completion of considerable percentage of such work, one of the partner namely MMS abandoned the project and left the country, thereby leaving the GAMMON as well as CMRL in lurch. According to GAMMON, which is a lead party as per the Joint Venture Agreement, it is entitled to step in at the place of MMS and continue the contract work by bringing in any third party in the place of MMS. In this aspect, clause  19.11 JV agreement is relied on by the applicant which deals with step in right which reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">\t19.11 Step-in Rights of the LP: In the event of a default by the other Party due to which Employer expressly indicates its intention to suspend or terminate the Contract or levy liquidated damages or penalties for the breach or default under the Contract of an amount mutually agreed by parties hereto and no reasonable action to remedy such breach or default is initiated by the other Party within fourteen (14) days of the service of such notice, then the LP shall have the right to take over and complete the other Party&#x27;s Scope of Work for the account and at the risk and cost of such Party subject to the approval of the Employer.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">LP may exercise its discretion to invoke the Step-in Rights at any time as indicated in this clause above.  The discretion of the LP not to exercise its step-in rights shall not be deemed to be a waiver of its rights at any time.  In any case the other Party shall remain liable as a Defaulting Party as indicated in this Agreement.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_112\">\t53. It is the further case  of the applicant that even though CMRL has extended the time for completion of the projection and when the time so granted has not expired, they should have waited till the completion of the extended period and permitted the applicant, in the meantime, to exercise the step in right and to bring in another party to complete the project. It is their case that they have made several request to CMRL for exercising the step in right and the same was not  considered. Per contra, it is the contention of CMRL that the Joint Venture has delayed the project and sought for extension one after another. It is their further case that MMS  which abandoned the project has in fact made complaint against GAMMON that they were slow in completing their work. It is the further case of the CMRL that the work undertaken under the Contract entered between JV and CMRL, cannot be permitted to be continued by another third party at the instance of GAMMON. It is also the contention of the CMRL that once the MMS abandoned the project, the JV automatically comes to an end and therefore, the GAMMON cannot independently act as though the JV continues. To this submission, the applicant relies on Clause 20.2 of JV Agreement  to contend that only when all the events referred to under the said clause have taken place, the Joint Venture Agreement can be said to have come  to an end and till such time, it survives. Clause 20.2 of JV Agreement reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">\t20.2 This Agreement shall stand terminated when all of the following events have occurred:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">i) all the Works have been completed and all obligations under the terms of the Contract have been performed or the Contract has been terminated;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">ii) all bonds and guarantees including counter guarantees have been returned or have expired and all accounts have been closed without reserves;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">iii) all pending issues, disputes or differences arising out of or in connection with the Joint Venture&#x27;s activities have been settled; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">iv) all tax assessments have been completed and settled.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"209592\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"375173\" id=\"span_27\">54.  The learned Advocate General further relied on a decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court reported in 2005(<a href=\"/doc/375173/\" id=\"a_90\">5) ALD 450, Gvprel-Mee(J.V.), vs Government of Andhra Pradesh</a> and 2007(<a href=\"/doc/209592/\" id=\"a_91\">6) M.L.J. 525, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited vs Rajarajeswari Agency</a> in support of his submission that joint venture cannot survive, if one of the partner of joint venture goes out of the contract.</span></span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">\t55.  In my considered view, the observations made in the above decisions is not to be applied uniformly in all cases where there is a joint venture partners.  Needless to say that the terms of the joint venture agreement place a major role to decide as to whether the other partner of joint venture can continue even if one of the joint venture goes out.  In this case, I have already pointed out that there is a clause in joint venture agreement dealing with step in right under Clause No.19.11.  Further Clause 20.2 of JV Agreement contemplates when the said agreement stands terminated. Therefore, I find the above decisions are also not helping the respondents in any manner. No doubt the issue as to whether the joint venture continues or not  in view of clause 19.11 and clause 20.2 has also to be gone into and decided in the arbitral proceedings by considering the above said clause 19.11 and 20.2.  When such issue is to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal, this Court at this stage, is not required to go into such issue and give finding.  However, existence of these distinct and different facts have to be considered as a strong prima facie case in favour of the applicant to decide the applications against invocation of Bank Guarantees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">\t56. Needless to say that the other contentions touching upon the merits of termination  raised by both parties are to be considered and decided only by the Arbitral Tribunal and therefore, at this stage, I am not inclined to go into the same and give any finding. What is to be seen at this stage is as to whether the applicants have made out a prima facie case for an order of interim injunction against the invocation of Bank Guarantee. In other words, this Court has to see as to what would be the appropriate order which would protect the interest of both parties during the pendency of Arbitral Tribunal. Both sides relied on several decisions on this aspect touching upon the invocation of Bank Guarantees which are as follows: \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"737188\" id=\"span_28\">57. Mr.Sathish Parasaran, learned counsel appearing for the applicant relied on 1975(<a href=\"/doc/737188/\" id=\"a_92\">1) SCC 199, The Godhra Electricity Co. Ltd., vs The State of Gujarat</a>, in support of his submission that even if there is any ambiguity in the written contract between the parties, subsequent conduct of the parties are relevant for consideration to find out as to what was the actual intention of the parties in respect of the contract.  Paragraph No.11 of <a href=\"/doc/737188/\" id=\"a_93\">the above decision</a> reads as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">\t&quot;11.In the process of interpretation of the terms of a contract, the court can frequently get great assistance from the interpreting statements made by the parties themselves or from their conduct in rendering or in receiving performances under it.  Parties can, by mutual agreement, make their own contracts; they can also by mutual agreement remake them.  The process of practical interpretation and application, however, is not regarded by the parties as a remaking of the contract; nor do the courts so regard it.  Instead, it is merely a further expression by the parties of the meaning that they give and have given to the terms of their contract previously made.  There is no good reason why the courts should not give great weight to these further expressions by the parties, in view of the fact that they still have the same freedom of contract that they had originally.  The American Courts receive subsequent actings as admissible guides in interpretation.  It is true that one party cannot build up his case by making an interpretation in his own favour.  It is the concurrence therein that such a party can use against the other party.  This concurrence may be evidence by the other party&#x27;s express assent thereto, by his acting in accordance with it, by his receipt without objection of performances that indicate it, or by saying nothing when he knows that the first party is acting on reliance upon the interpretation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">\t58. The learned counsel Mr.Sathish Parasaran for the applicant relied on 1988(1) SCC 174, UP Coop Federation Ltd. v. Singh Consultants &amp; Engineers (P) Ltd., in support of his submission that the bank guarantees cannot be permitted to be invoked in order to prevent irretrievable injustice between the parties.  Paragraph No.28 of the above decision reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">\t&quot;I am, however, of the opinion that these observations must be strictly considered in the light of the principle enunciated.  It is not the decision that there should be a prima facie case.  In order to restrain the operation either of irrevocable letter of credit or of confirmed letter of credit or of bank guarantee, there should be serious dispute and there should be good prima facie case of fraud and special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties.  Otherwise the very purpose of bank guarantees would be negatived and the fabric of trading operation will get jeopardised.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">\t59. Mr.R.Thiyagarajan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Chennai Metro Rail Limited submitted that the beneficiary is the best Judge to decide as to when and for what reason the bank guarantee to be revoked.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_29\">In support of such submission, he relied on the decision of the Apex Court reported in 2006(<a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_94\">2) SCC 728, Bses Ltd (Now Reliance Energy Ltd) vs Fenner India Ltd and another</a>.  However, perusal of the above said decision also shows that there are two exceptions to the Rule that the Bank must pay according to the tenure of the guarantee, on demand without proof or condition.  The first exception is fraud which the Bank has noticed and the second exception is when there are special equities in favour of injunction viz., &quot;irretrievable injury&quot; or &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot; .  Paragraph No.10 of <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_95\">the said decision</a> reads as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_30\">&quot;10.There are, however, two exceptions to this rule.  The first is when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks to benefit.  The fraud must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction.  The second exception to the general rule of non-intervention is when there are &quot;special equities&quot; in favour of injunction, such as when &quot;irretrievable injury&quot; or &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot; would occur if such an injunction were not granted.  The general rule and its exceptions has been reiterated in so many judgments of this Court, that in <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_96\">U.P. State Sugar Corpn v. Sumac International Ltd.</a>, (1997) 1 SCC 568, (hereinafter &quot;U.P. State Sugar Corpn&quot;) this Court, correctly declared that the law was &quot;settled&quot;.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">\t60. Therefore, it is clear that the court can always go into the question as to whether irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice would occur, if such an injunction is not granted in favour of the guarantor.  If the Court is satisfied that the application of such exception to the general Rule is warranted based on the facts and circumstances of the case, there cannot be any impediment for the court to grant such an order of injunction only for the purpose of preventing the &quot;irretrievable injury&quot; or &quot;irretrievable injustice&quot; to the parties concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_31\">61. 2008 (<a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_97\">1) SCC 544, Vinitec Electronics Private Ltd. vs HCL Infosystems Ltd.</a>, is relied on by the learned Senior Counsel for CMRL to contend that the bank is bound to honour the bank guarantee if it is unconditional.  Paragraph No.22 reads as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">\t&quot;22. In the present case the amended clause does not refer to any of the clauses specifically as such but on the other hand the Bank had undertaken responsibility to pay any sum or sums within the guaranteed limit upon receipt of written demand from the Company.  The operative portion of the bank guarantee furnished by the Bank does not refer to any of the conditions for payment under the Bank guarantee.  It is true that the bank guarantee furnished makes a reference to the principal agreement between the parties in its preamble.  Mere fact that the bank guarantee refers to the principal agreement in the preamble of the deed of guarantee does not make the guarantee furnished by the Bank to be a conditional one unless any particular clause of the agreement has been made part of the deed of guarantee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">\t62. In the case on hand, it is not only the bank guarantee refers to the principal agreement in the deed of guarantee but the contract agreement entered between the parties also refers to the joint venture agreement as well as the guarantee for the system as forming part of the contract agreement.  Therefore, the relevant terms and conditions referred to under the joint venture agreement  followed by the contract agreement would certainly have to be read into the bank guarantee terms also so as to find out as to whether the beneficiary is entitled to invoke the same or not.  In this case, the termination had taken place admittedly even before the expiry of the time granted by the CMRL to the applicant for completion of the project.  It is seen from the Addendum No.1 to Contract UAA-02 entered on 16.08.2013 that the time schedule for completion of the work was extended as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">A\nGovernment Estate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">1597</span>\n16-Aug-2015\n   B\nLIC\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">1673</span>\n31-Oct-2015\n   C\nThousand Lights\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">1688</span>\n15-Nov-2015\nKD11\nAchieve issuance of Taking Over Certificate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">1825</span>\n31-Mar-2016\nKD12\nAchieve issuance of Performance Certificate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">2555</span>\n31-Mar-2018\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">\t63. When that being the facts and circumstances of the present case, I am of the view that the invoking of the bank guarantee in pursuant to the termination of the contract even before the expiry of its time, would certainly cause irretrievable injury to the guarantor and if it is permitted, it would amount to irretrievable injustice done to them.  Therefore, I find <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_98\">the above decision</a> is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">\t64. The following decisions are relied by the learned Senior Counsel Mr.R.Thiagarajan appearing for the CMRL strongly opposing to the injunction application against the invocation of the bank guarantee.  1999 (8) SCC 436, Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd vs State of Bihar, wherein at paragraph No.8, it has been observed as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">\t&quot;8.Now, a bank guarantee is the common mode of securing payment of money in commercial dealings as the beneficiary, under the guarantee, is entitled to realise the whole of the amount under that guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending dispute between the person on whose behalf the guarantee was given and the beneficiary.  In contracts awarded to private individuals by the Government, which involve huge expenditure, as, for example, construction contracts, bank guarantees are usually required to be furnished in favour of the Government to secure payments made to the contractor as &quot;advance&quot; from time to time during the course of the contract as also to secure performance of the work entrusted under the contract.  Such guarantees are encashable in terms thereof on the lapse of the contractor either in the performance of the work or in paying back to the Government &quot;advance&quot;, the guarantee is invoked and the amount is recovered from the Bank.  It is for this reason that the courts are reluctant in granting an injunction against the invocation of bank guarantee, except in the case of fraud, which should be an established fraud, or where irretrievable injury was likely to be caused to the guarantor.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">\t65. Perusal of the facts and circumstances of the case before the Apex Court would show that HCCL was awarded a contract by the State of Bihar and the period of contract was for 42 months and the work was to be completed by 24.10.1992.  The HCCL had not adhered to the schedule of the work and on the other hand, abandoned the same after it had received the mobilisation advance.  Therefore, the subject matter bank guarantees therein were invoked.  Considering the above stated facts, the Apex Court has held as supra.  The facts of the present case are totally different as the abandonment was not by the joint venture in toto,  apart from the fact that the extended period of contract has not come to an end on the date of issuing the order of termination. Moreover, the step in clause contained in the Joint Venture Agreement strongly relied on by the applicant plays a vital role in deciding the rights of the respective parties. Therefore, I find that the above decision is factually distinguishable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"218672\" id=\"span_37\">66. 1991(<a href=\"/doc/218672/\" id=\"a_99\">4) SCC 230, General Electric Technical Services Company Inc. vs Punj Sons (P) Ltd</a>, is relied on in support of the contention against the grant of injunction.  In the above said decision, the Apex Court has held that the bank has committed honour it has to pay as per the undertaking.  It is also observed that the bank cannot be interdicted by the court in the absence of fraud or special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice between the parties.  Here again, perusal of the facts and circumstances of the above said case would show that the first respondent therein who was a contractor failed to complete the project within the stipulated time as per the contract inspite of repeated opportunities given to them.  Thereafter the employer therein terminated the contract and sought to invoke the bank guarantee.  As the present case is on a different footing as discussed supra, this decision is also factually distinguishable and not helping the CMRL.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_38\">67. 1997(<a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_100\">1) SCC 568, U.P.State Sugar Corporation vs Sumac International Ltd.</a>, is relied to contend that injunction cannot be granted and the court should be slow in granting injunction to restrain the realisation of the bank guarantee.  The facts of the above said case would also disclose that the contractor therein failed to complete the work therein within the time granted and further extended therein and consequently the employer therein terminated the contract thereafter and invoked the bank guarantees.   Therefore, the facts of the present case are totally different one and hence<a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_101\">, <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_102\">the above decision</a></a> is not helping the respondents in any manner.  Even otherwise, the Apex Court in the very same decision has also considered the exception for granting injunction at paragraph No.12 as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">\t&quot;12.The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by now well settled.  When in the course of commercial dealings an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes.  The bank giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer.  The very purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated.  The courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank guarantee.  The courts have carve out only two exceptions.  A fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee.  Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so.  The second exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties concerned.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">Therefore, the Court has to necessarily see as to whether the invoking of the bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to any of the parties to the contract.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"7094\" id=\"span_39\">68. AIR 2007 Supreme Court 2716, <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_103\">Mahatma Gandhi Sahakara Sakkare Karkhane vs National Heavy Engg. Coop. Ltd.</a> is further relied on to contend that bank guarantee without any demur is recoverable.  Here again the facts of <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_104\">the above case</a> would show that the respondents therein failed to perform his part of the contract within the stipulated time.  He failed to commission the plan in terms of the agreement within the stipulated time inspite of repeated notice.  Therefore, the above said case is also factually distinguishable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"7094\" id=\"span_40\">69. An unreported decision of the learned Single Judge of this Court made in O.A.Nos.656 to 659 of 2011 dated 29.06.2012 is cited once again to contend that invocation of bank guarantee cannot be stalled.  Perusal of <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_105\">the said decision</a> would show that the learned Judge has observed at paragraph No.26 that the Bank guarantee can be invoked unless fraud or irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice is established.  The learned Judge found therein that there was no allegation of fraud or irretrievable injury or injustice <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_106\">in that case</a>.   There also it appears that the contractor therein has not performed the contract work as per the stipulation and they have not made any progress in the work.  The facts of the present case being a different one as discussed supra<a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_107\">, <a href=\"/doc/7094/\" id=\"a_108\">the above case</a></a> relied on is also not helping the respondent.</span>  \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_130\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"684433\" id=\"span_41\">70. <a href=\"/doc/684433/\" id=\"a_109\">AIR 1951 SC 280, Bishundeo Narain vs Seogeni Rai</a>, is relied on by the learned senior counsel for the CMRL to contend that the parties pleading fraud must file full particulars.  In this case, I do not think that the applicant has made any specific allegation of fraud on the part of the CMRL.  On the other hand, their contention is that the irretrievable injury and injustice would be caused to them, if the bank guarantee is invoked during the pendency of the arbitral proceedings.  Therefore<a href=\"/doc/684433/\" id=\"a_110\">, <a href=\"/doc/684433/\" id=\"a_111\">the said decision</a></a> is also not relevant for consideration for the present case.</span>\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\">\t 71. The Courts have repeatedly held that the exception for refusing to grant injunction against invocation of Bank Guarantee is fraud and irretrievable injury. In my considered view, fraud and irretrievable injury need not necessarily go together.  Once fraud is pleaded and proved that is the end of the matter for granting injunction. In such a scenerio, there need not be any irretrievable injury to exist. Fraud vitiates everything.  Hence, I am of the view that both fraud and irretrievable injury need not necessarily co-exist for seeking injunction. If any one of the same exists, the Court can consider the same.  Therefore, this Court has to see as to whether irretrievable injury and injustice would be caused to the applicants if the Bank Guarantees are invoked during the pendency of arbitral proceedings.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_132\">\t72. On careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case, I find that irretrievable injury would be caused to the applicant if the injunction against the invocation of Bank Guarantee is refused and that it would lead to an irretrievable injustice to the applicant.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_133\">\t73. It is claimed that 60% of the work was already completed by Joint Venture and therefore, the  remaining work  to be completed is only 37%. Even to complete the said work, the lead party namely GAMMON sought permission from CMRL to exercise the step in right as contemplated under Clause 19.11. The said request was not considered by CMRL for various reasons. Admittedly, the CMRL has extended the time for completion of the contract and  the extended time has not admittedly  expired on the date of issuing the termination order. The GAMMON has not simply sought for permission to bring in a third party by exercising the step in right without making any bonafide attempt. On the other hand, it is a matter of fact that GAMMON sought to bring in an Italian company for completing the remaining work. This was also not considered by CMRL. Such attempt of GAMMON certainly, show the bonafide on their part in completing the project. It is also claimed that the CMRL has not settled some bills in respect  of the works already completed to the tune of Rs.100 crores. However, this claim is denied by CMRL by stating that the applicant cannot expect CMRL to pump in a sum of Rs.100 crores when the JV  has admittedly failed and its JV partner had abandoned the project. Needless to say that this claim by the applicant and denial by the respondent is a matter to be gone into by the Arbitral Tribunal. These are all the facts prima facie indicate that termination of the contract followed by the attempt to invoke the bank Guarantee would certainly cause irretrievable injury to the applicant. Inspite of all those facts, if injunction is refused, in my considered view, it would cause to the applicant  not only an irretrievable injury but also irretrievable injustice. In fact, the very termination of contract, not stayed by this Court, has already caused irretrievable injury. Whether termination is valid or not is to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal. However, as the termination, not stayed  by  this  Court has caused  irretrievable  injury to the applicant, pending  disposal  of  the  arbitral proceedings , further  injury can  be  averted  by  granting  the  injunction against invoking Bank Guarantees. It should  also  be noted that not granting of stay of termination by this Court in this proceedings is not based on merits of the rival contentions of the parties, but  on  the  reason that  termination has  already  come  into  force  and  staying  the  same  would  revive  the  party to  their  original  position. Further, it is a matter of fact that already the CMRL has invoked two bank guarantees which are the subject matter in other two applications in Application Nos.730 &amp; 733 of 2015. As the Bank Guarantees have been invoked in those matters, those applications were dismissed by this Court on 07.08.2015. \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">\t74. Admittedly, the Bank Guarantees  given by the applicant are  alive and the CMRL can at any time, invoke the same. Therefore, the interest of the CMRL is well protected by the Bank Guarantees furnished by the applicant. If those Bank guarantees are continued to be alive during the arbitral proceedings and even thereafter, during the pendency of the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 34</a> of the said Act, the interest of the CMRL is in no way be affected or prejudiced. On the other hand, if the Bank guarantees are invoked in the mean time, certainly, the applicant would be put to great financial strain as the concerned Banks which had given Bank Guarantee would ultimately, bounce upon the applicant to pay the money. In my considered view, this would certainly make the applicant to suffer even before the Arbitral Tribunal decides the main  dispute between the parties.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">\t75.  At the same time, as this Court has not stayed the termination, it is open to the CMRL to go ahead with the project and complete the same by employing a new contractor  for which, they have already taken steps by issuing paper publication inviting tenders. Since the project is an important project which cannot brook the delay any more, this Court cannot prevent the respondent from going ahead with the project and complete the same with the third party. Therefore,  the interest of the CMRL, in this aspect, is also well protected.\t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">\t76.
