Both these interim applications can be disposed of by a\n\ncommon order because they involve common question of law\n\nrelating to invocation and encashment of Bank Guarantee.\n\nFacts are also similar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">4.   Some background of both the applications needs to be\n\ngiven because the counsel appearing for the parties have\n\ninsisted that these cases are clearly distinguishable from the\n\nfacts of long line of judgments of the Supreme Court which lay\n\ndown how limited is the interference of the courts with\n\ninvocation and encashment of Bank Guarantee.               Counsel\n\nstated that analysis of facts and careful perusal of the relevant\n\ndocuments is necessary because that would make it clearly\n\nevident that the Bank Guarantees of these cases are\n\nconditional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">5.   We shall first turn to Shapoorji&#x27;s case.    On 15/5/2010\n\nShapoorji entered into a PPA with GUVNL for supply of 800\n\nMW Power on the terms and conditions stated in the PPA. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                            Page 4 of 73</span>\n                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nterms include the fulfilment of Conditions Subsequent by\n\nShapoorji as provided in <a href=\"/doc/452639/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 3.1.</a> Shapoorji could not fulfil\n\nthe Conditions Subsequent.        According to Shapoorji its\n\ninability to fulfil the Conditions Subsequent is solely due to\n\ncircumstances beyond its control as it was impacted by Force\n\nMajeure Events. Shapoorji sought extension of time to fulfil\n\nthe conditions subsequent vide letters dated 02/07/2012,\n\n30/01/2013,      10/05/2013,     29/07/2013,       10/02/2015,\n\n21/04/2015 and 27/07/2015.         Extension was granted by\n\nGUVNL till 14/02/2013 on 09/10/2012.          On 19/03/2013\n\nagain extension was granted upto 14/05/2013.          Because of\n\nthe request of Shapoorji again on 29/06/2013 extension of\n\ntime was granted until 14/11/2013 subject to Shapoorji\n\ndepositing an additional Performance Bank Guarantee of\n\nRs.80 crores.     On 03/08/2013 GUVNL again informed\n\nShapoorji that time would be extended subject to Shapoorji\n\ndepositing additional Performance Bank Guarantee of Rs.80\n\ncrores.     On   07/01//2014,     13/03/2014,      07/05/2014,\n\n30/06/2014, 21/08/2014 and 28/11/2014 GUVNL requested\n\nShapoorji   to   submit   additional   Contract     Performance\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                           Page 5 of 73</span>\n                                                    Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nGuarantee of Rs.80 crores. However it was not furnished. On\n\n29/12/2014, 07/02/2015, 15/04/2015, 06/08/2015 and\n\n20/08/2015 GUVNL sent letters to Shapoorji stating that the\n\nexisting Contract Performance Guarantee of Rs.240 cores will\n\nbe   encashed      unless    additional    Contract     Performance\n\nGuarantee of Rs.80 crores is furnished. It was not furnished.\n\nShapoorji&#x27;s request was that additional Contract Performance\n\nGuarantee may not be insisted upon and extension of time be\n\ngranted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">6.   On 26/05/2015 Shapoorji filed Petition No.1511 of 2015\n\nagainst GUVNL, inter alia praying (i) for evolving a mechanism\n\nfor determination of tariff for supply of electricity under the\n\nPPA or otherwise so as to ensure that the adverse impact of\n\nthe Change in Law Events and/or unforeseen/uncontrollable\n\nevents     which   are   listed   in   paragraph   17    thereof       is\n\nadjusted/absorbed/offset into the tariff by revising the tariff to\n\nthe extent of such impact so as to make the Project\n\neconomically viable and (ii) to direct the Respondent to extend\n\nthe time period for achieving the Conditions Subsequent in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                              Page 6 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nterms of Article 3.1.1. of the PPA by a suitable further period\n\nof at least 6 months from the date of final decision of the State\n\nCommission in respect of the present petition and to\n\ncorrespondingly extend the Scheduled Delivery Date, without\n\ninsisting for any additional Contract Performance Guarantee.\n\nShapoorji stated in this petition, inter alia, that promulgation\n\nof Indonesian Regulation No.17 of 2010 by Indonesian\n\nGovernment, subsequent to the PPA, is a Change in Law\n\nand/or Force Majeure Event which has increased the price of\n\nimported coal and has impacted viability of the PPA. In this\n\npetition, IA No.7 of 2015 was filed by Shapoorji for interim\n\nrelief. It must be stated here that GUVNL also filed Petition\n\nNo.1526 of 2015 before the State Commission seeking\n\nsubmission of an additional Contract Performance Guarantee\n\nof Rs.80 crores by Shapoorji.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">7.   On 07/02/2017 both the petitions i.e. Petition No.1511\n\nof 2015 and Petition No.1526 of 2015 were listed before the\n\nState Commission. It is the case of Shapoorji that statement\n\nwas made by officers of GUVNL that Contract Performance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                            Page 7 of 73</span>\n                                               Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nGuarantee will not be encashed and therefore the State\n\nCommission adjourned the matters.       GUVNL has filed an\n\naffidavit on 13/02/2017 before the Gujarat High Court that no\n\nsuch statement was made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">8.   On 08/02/2017 a Termination Notice was issued by\n\nGUVNL to Shapoorji invoking Article 3.4.2 of the PPA that the\n\nContract Performance Guarantee of Rs. 240 crores furnished\n\nby ICICI Bank would be encashed and GUVNL would be\n\nentitled to recover an additional amount of Rs.80 crores. On\n\n09/02/2017 Shapoorji filed IA No.3 of 2017 praying that\n\npending hearing and final disposal of Petition No.1511 of\n\n2015, GUVNL be restrained from encashing the Contract\n\nPerformance Guarantee or on insisting on any additional\n\nContract   Performance     Guarantee.     Since     the      State\n\nCommission did not take up the matter, Shapoorji filed Special\n\nCivil Application No.2360 of 2017 before the Gujarat High\n\nCourt.   On 28/03/2017 the Gujarat High Court disposed of\n\nthe said application directing the State Commission to dispose\n\nof the cases on the date fixed by it. Without going into the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                         Page 8 of 73</span>\n                                                Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nmerits of the case, the High Court passed an order of status\n\nquo till the hearing is over and order is passed by the State\n\nCommission. The High Court however observed that it will be\n\nopen to the State Commission to pass appropriate order on\n\ninterim applications.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">9.   On 28/04/2017 Shapoorji filed an application before the\n\nGujarat High Court seeking a direction that the State\n\nCommission should hear the main petition being Petition\n\nNo.1511 of 2015 along with all the interim applications. This\n\nrequest was not acceded to by the High Court, hence on\n\n03/05/2017     Shapoorji   withdrew   the   application.         On\n\n18/05/2017 after hearing the parties the State Commission\n\ndismissed IA No.3 of 2017.     As already stated, order dated\n\n18/05/2017 is challenged in Shapoorji&#x27;s appeal and instant IA\n\nNo.384 of 2017 is filed in the said appeal praying that pending\n\ndisposal of this appeal the impugned order be stayed and\n\nGUVNL be restrained from invoking/encashing the existing\n\nContract Performance Guarantee provided by ICICI Bank to\n\nGUVNL.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                          Page 9 of 73</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">10.   We shall now turn to Essar Power&#x27;s case. Essar Power\n\nentered into PPA dated 15/05/2010 with GUVNL whereunder\n\nEssar Power agreed to establish the generating station and\n\ngenerate and supply electricity for a contracted capacity of 800\n\nMW on the terms and conditions stated in the PPA. The terms\n\ninclude the fulfilment by Essar Power of the Conditions\n\nSubsequent as provided in <a href=\"/doc/452639/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 3.1</a> of the PPA. Essar Power\n\ncould not fulfil the Conditions Subsequent.        According to\n\nEssar Power, the said inability was due to circumstances\n\nbeyond its control as it was impacted by Force Majeure\n\nEvents.   On 04/06/2011, GUVNL issued a letter to Essar\n\nPower stating that it had not submitted sufficient data in\n\nsupport of fulfilment of Conditions Subsequent though 12\n\nmonths from the effective date had elapsed. On 12/08/2011,\n\nGUVNL sent a letter to Essar Power stating that it&#x27;s request for\n\nextension of time till 15/03/2012 could not be granted and\n\nrequested Essar Power to furnish an additional Contract\n\nPerformance Guarantee for Rs.12 crores per week for the delay\n\nperiod.   On 18/08/2011, Essar Power issued Termination\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                         Page 10 of 73</span>\n                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nNotice seeking to terminate the PPA under Article 3.4.5. On\n\n20/08/2011, GUVNL called upon Essar Power to withdraw the\n\nTermination Notice. Thereafter, there was a meeting between\n\nthe parties. On 10/10/2011, GUVNL issued a letter to Essar\n\nPower stating that it had agreed to grant extension of time till\n\n14/08/2012 without seeking additional Contract Performance\n\nGuarantee subject to the condition that such extension shall\n\nnot entitle Essar Power for extension in Scheduled Delivery\n\nDate. On 12/10/2011, Essar Power withdrew the Termination\n\nNotice dated 18/08/2011 and further stated that it was\n\ncommitted to the Project and was keen to develop it and\n\ndeliver power as per its commitments. Essar Power was not\n\nable to fulfil Conditions Subsequent even in the extended time.\n\nOn 04/10/2012, GUVNL agreed to grant Essar Power\n\nextension of time limit upto 14/02/2013 without seeking\n\nadditional   Contract   Performance   Guarantee.       Again       on\n\n19/03/2013, GUVNL granted extension in time limit upto\n\n14/05/2013 without seeking additional Contract Performance\n\nGuarantee.    On 27/05/2013, Essar Power sought further\n\nextension of time. On 29/06/2013, GUVNL issued a letter to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                         Page 11 of 73</span>\n                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nEssar Power stating that extension upto 14/11/2013 would be\n\ngranted subject to Essar Power depositing an additional\n\nContract Performance Guarantee of Rs.80 crores in favour of\n\nGUVNL within 10 days.      Essar Power again sought time vide\n\nletter dated 08/07/2013.     GUVNL reiterated its stand vide\n\nletter dated 10/07/2013 that extension of time would be\n\ngranted subject to Essar Power depositing an additional\n\nContract Performance Guarantee of Rs.80 crores within 10\n\ndays.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">11.

Essar Power cited difficulties faced by it and did\n\nnot furnish additional Contract Performance Guarantee.

Hence, Essar Power filed I.A.\n\nNo.4 of 2017 inter alia seeking stay of Termination Notice\n\ndated 08/02/2017. Since urgent listing was declined, Essar\n\nPower filed S.C.A.

It is settled law that bank guarantee is an independent\n           and distinct contract between the bank and the beneficiary\n           and is not qualified by the underlying transaction and the\n           validity of the primary contract between the person at whose\n           instance the bank guarantee was given and the beneficiary.\n           Unless fraud or special equity exists, is pleaded and prima\n           facie established by strong evidence as a triable issue, the\n           beneficiary cannot be restrained from encashing the bank\n           guarantee even if dispute between the beneficiary and the\n           person at whose instance the bank guarantee was given by\n           the bank, had arisen in performance of the contract or\n           execution of the works undertaken in furtherance thereof. The\n           bank unconditionally and irrevocably promised to pay, on\n           demand, the amount of liability undertaken in the guarantee\n           without any demur or dispute in terms of the bank guarantee.\n           The object behind is to inculcate respect for free flow of\n           commerce and trade and faith in the commercial banking\n           transactions unhedged by pending disputes between the\n           beneficiary and the contractor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           5.     It is equally settled law that in terms of the bank\n           guarantee the beneficiary is entitled to invoke the bank\n           guarantee and seek encashment of the amount specified in\n           the bank guarantee. It does not depend upon the result of the\n           decision in the dispute between the parties, in case of the\n           breach. The underlying object is that an irrevocable\n           commitment either in the form of bank guarantee or letters of\n           credit solemnly given by the bank must be honoured. The\n           court exercising its power cannot interfere with enforcement of\n           bank guarantee/letters of credit except only in cases where\n           fraud or special equity is prima facie made out in the case as\n           triable issue by strong evidence so as to prevent irretrievable\n           injustice to the parties.

The High Court held that the petitioner has\nnot made out either. We have carefully scanned the reasons\ngiven by the High Court as well as the contentions raised by\nthe parties. On the facts, we do not find that any case of fraud\nhas been made out. The contention is that after promise to\nextend time for constructing the buildings and allotment of\nextra houses and the term of bank guarantees was extended,\nthe contract was terminated. It is not a case of fraud but one\nof acting in terms of contract. It is next contended by Shri G.\nNageshwara Rao, the learned counsel for the petitioner, that\nunless the amount due and payable is determined by a\ncompetent court or tribunal by mere invocation of bank\nguarantee or letter of credit pleading that the amount is due\nand payable by the petitioner, which was disputed, cannot be\nheld to be due and payable in a case. The Court has yet to go\ninto the question and until a finding after trial, or decision is\ngiven by a court or tribunal that amount is due and payable\nby the petitioner, it cannot be held to be due and payable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708879\" id=\"span_45\">Therefore, the High Court committed manifest error of law in\nrefusing to grant injunction as the petitioner has made out a\nprima facie strong case. We find no force in the contention. All\nthe clauses of the contract of the bank guarantee are to be\nread together.      Bank guarantee/letters of credit is an\nindependent contract between the bank and the beneficiary. It\ndoes not depend on the result of the dispute between the\nperson on whose behalf the bank guarantee was given by the\nbank and the beneficiary. Though the question was not\nelaborately discussed, it was in sum answered by this Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/708879/\" id=\"a_14\">Hindustan Steel Workers Construction Ltd. v. G.S. Atwal &amp;\nCo. (Engineers) (P) Ltd.1</a> (SCC at p. 79). This Court had held in\npara 6 that the entire dispute was pending before the\narbitrator. Whether, and if so, what is the amount due to the\nappellant was to be adjudicated in the arbitration\nproceedings. The order of the learned Single Judge proceeds\non the basis that the amounts claimed were not and cannot be\nsaid to be due and the bank has violated the understanding\nbetween the respondent and the bank in giving unconditional\nguarantee to the appellant. The learned Judge held that the\nbank had issued a guarantee in a standard form, covering a\nwider spectrum than agreed to between the respondent and\nthe bank and it cannot be a reason to hold that the appellant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                             Page 32 of 73</span>\n                                                          Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\n      is in any way fettered in invoking the conditional bank\n      guarantee. Similarly, the reasoning of the learned Single\n      Judge that before invoking the performance guarantee the\n      appellant should assess the quantum of loss and damages\n      and mention the ascertained figure, cannot be put forward to\n      restrain the appellant from invoking the unconditional\n      guarantee. This reasoning would clearly indicate that the final\n      adjudication is not a precondition to invoke the bank\n      guarantee and that is not a ground to issue injunction\n      restraining the beneficiary to enforce the bank guarantee.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1988070\" id=\"span_47\">In\n      <a href=\"/doc/1988070/\" id=\"a_15\">Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd. v.

It was contended therein that those were exceptional\n      circumstances justifying interference by restraining the\n      appellant from enforcing the bank guarantee. The High Court\n      had issued interim injunction from enforcing the bank\n      guarantee. Interfering with and reversing the order of the High\n      Court, this Court has held in para 23 that a bank must honour\n      its commitment free from interference by the courts. The\n      special circumstances or special equity pleaded in the case\n      that there was a serious dispute on the question as to who\n      has committed the breach of the contract and that whether the\n      amount is due and payable by the contractor to the appellant\n      till the arbitrator declares the award, was not sufficient to\n      make the case an exceptional one justifying interference by\n      restraining the appellant from enforcing the bank guarantee.\n      ......&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">26.

They further provide\n      that the appellant shall be the sole judge of whether and to\n      what extent the amount has become recoverable from the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                  Page 33 of 73</span>\n                                                    Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nrespondent or whether the respondent has committed any\nbreach of the terms and conditions of the agreement. The bank\nguarantees further provide that the right of the purchaser to\nrecover from the guarantor any amount shall not be affected or\nsuspended by reason of any disputes that may have been\nraised by the respondent with regard to its liability or on the\nground that proceedings are pending before any Tribunal,\nArbitrator or Court with regard to such dispute. The guarantor\nshall immediately pay the guaranteed amount to the\nappellant-purchasers on demand.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">12. The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees\nis by now well settled. When in the course of commercial\ndealings an unconditional bank guarantee is given or\naccepted, the beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank\nguarantee in terms thereof irrespective of any pending\ndisputes. The bank giving such a guarantee is bound to\nhonour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by\nits customer. The very purpose of giving such a bank\nguarantee would otherwise be defeated. The courts should,\ntherefore, be slow in granting an injunction to restrain the\nrealization of such a bank guarantee. The courts have carved\nout only two exceptions. A fraud in connection with such a\nbank guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a\nbank guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the\nbeneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained\nfrom doing so. The second exception relates to cases where\nallowing the encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee\nwould result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the\nparties concerned. Since in most cases payment of money\nunder such a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank\nand its customer at whose instance the guarantee is given, the\nharm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of\nsuch an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override\nthe terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an\ninjunction on commercial dealings in the country. The two\ngrounds are not necessarily connected, though both may\ncoexist in some cases. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_49\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_16\">U.P.

The bank must pay according to the tenor of its\n           guarantee on demand without proof or condition. There are\n           only two exceptions to this rule. The first exception is a case\n           when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice. The\n           fraud must be of an egregious nature such as to vitiate the\n           entire underlying transaction.</span> Explaining the kind of fraud\n           that may absolve a bank from honouring its guarantee, this\n           Court <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_17\">in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_18\">the above case</a></a> quoted with approval the observations\n           of Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in Bolivinter Oil SA v.

The law relating to invocation of bank guarantees is by\n           now well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court. The\n           bank guarantees which provided that they are payable by the\n           guarantor on demand is considered to be an unconditional\n           bank guarantee. When in the course of commercial dealings,\n           unconditional guarantees have been given or accepted the\n           beneficiary is entitled to realise such a bank guarantee in\n           terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_55\">In <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_21\">U.P.\n           State Sugar Corpn. v.

The law relating to invocation of such bank\n                   guarantees is by now well settled.

The courts should,\n      therefore, be slow in granting an injunction to\n      restrain the realisation of such a bank guarantee.\n      The courts have carved out only two exceptions. A\n      fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee\n      would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank\n      guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which\n      the beneficiary seeks to take advantage, he can be\n      restrained from doing so. The second exception\n      relates to cases where allowing the encashment of\n      an unconditional bank guarantee would result in\n      irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties\n      concerned. Since in most cases payment of money\n      under such a bank guarantee would adversely\n      affect the bank and its customer at whose instance\n      the guarantee is given, the harm or injustice\n      contemplated under this head must be of such an\n      exceptional and irretrievable nature as would\n      override the terms of the guarantee and the\n      adverse effect of such an injunction on commercial\n      dealings in the country. The two grounds are not\n      necessarily connected, though both may coexist in\n      some cases.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">12. It is equally well settled in law that bank guarantee is\nan independent contract between bank and the beneficiary\nthereof. The bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as\nlong as it is an unconditional and irrevocable one. The dispute\nbetween the beneficiary and the party at whose instance the\nbank has given the guarantee is immaterial and of no\nconsequence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_58\">In <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_22\">BSES Ltd. v.

The first is when there is a clear fraud of\n      which the bank has notice and a fraud of the\n      beneficiary from which it seeks to benefit. The\n      fraud must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate\n      the entire underlying transaction.

In the present case the amended clause does not refer\nto any of the clauses specifically as such but on the other\nhand the Bank had undertaken responsibility to pay any sum\nor sums within the guaranteed limit upon receipt of written\ndemand from the Company. The operative portion of the bank\nguarantee furnished by the Bank does not refer to any of the\nconditions for payment under the bank guarantee. It is true\nthat the bank guarantee furnished makes a reference to the\nprincipal agreement between the parties in its preamble. Mere\nfact that the bank guarantee refers to the principal agreement\nin the preamble of the deed of guarantee does not make the\nguarantee furnished by the Bank to be a conditional one\nunless any particular clause of the agreement has been made\npart of the deed of guarantee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">23. The recitals in the preamble in the deed of guarantee do\nnot control the operative part of the deed.

The appellant, therefore, cannot be\nallowed to raise any dispute and prevent the respondent from\nencashing the bank guarantee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_81\">24. The next question that falls for our consideration is as to\nwhether the present case falls under any of or both the\nexceptions, namely, whether there is a clear fraud of which\nthe Bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which\nit seeks to benefit and another exception whether there are\nany &quot;special equities&quot; in favour of granting injunction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">25.

In that case the learned\nSingle Judge came to the conclusion that\nthe suit involved serious questions to be\ntried and particularly relating to the plea of\nfraud, which was a significant factor to be\ntaken into account and claim for\ninterdicting the enforcement of Bank\nGuarantee should have been allowed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">28. I am, however, of the opinion that these\nobservations must be strictly considered in\nthe light of the principle enunciated. It is\nnot the decision that there should be a\nprima facie case.

If under law, the bank cannot\nbe prevented by SCE(P) Ltd from honouring\nthe credit guarantees, the UPCOF Ltd. also\ncannot be restrained from invoking the\nguarantees. What applies to the bank must\nequally apply to UPCOF Ltd. Therefore, the\nframe of the suit by not impleading the\nbank cannot make any difference in the\nposition of law. Equally, it would be futile\nto contend that the court was justified in\ngranting the injunction since it has found a\nprima facie case in favour of the SCE(P)\nLtd.

From the above discussion, what\nappears to me is this: The sound banking\nsystem may, however require more caution\nin the issuance of irrevocable documentary\ncredits. It would be for the banks to\nsafeguard themselves by other means and\ngenerally not for the court to come to their\nrescue with injunctions unless there is\nestablished fraud. In the result, this appeal\nmust be allowed. The judgment and order\nof the Allahabad High Court dated\nFebruary 20, 1987 must be set aside and\nthe order of learned Civil Judge, Lucknow\ndated August 8, 1986 restored.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">12. It is equally well settled in law that\nBank Guarantee is an independent\ncontract between bank and the beneficiary\nthereof. The bank is always obliged to\nhonour its guarantee as long as it is an\nunconditional and irrevocable one.

There are, however, two\n     exceptions to this rule. The first is\n     when there is a clear fraud of\n     which the Bank has notice and a\n     fraud of the beneficiary from\n     which it seeks to benefit. The\n     fraud must be of an egregious\n     nature as to vitiate the entire\n     underlying     transaction.     The\n     second exception to the general\n     rule of non-intervention is when\n     there are &#x27;special equities&#x27; in\n     favour of injunction, such as\n     when &#x27;irretrievable injury&#x27; or\n     &#x27;irretrievable   injustice&#x27;  would\n     occur if such an injunction were\n     not granted.

It is not necessary to multiply the judgments\n\nas the law is crystallized in the above judgments and has been\n\nfollowed in all the later judgments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">31.   The principles <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_32\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court can be\n\nsummarized     as   follows:   The     Bank   Guarantee       is    an\n\nindependent contract between the bank and the beneficiary\n\nthereof. The bank is always obliged to honour its guarantee as\n\nlong as it is an unconditional and irrevocable Bank Guarantee.\n\nThe dispute between the beneficiary and party, at whose\n\ninstance the bank has given the guarantee is immaterial and\n\nis of no consequence. The liability of the bank is absolute and\n\nunequivocal. The bank has to only verify whether the amount\n\nclaimed is within the terms of the Bank Guarantee or Letter of\n\nCredit. Any payment by the bank would obviously be subject\n\nto the final decision of the court or the tribunal. At the stage\n\nof invocation of Bank Guarantee, there is no need for final\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                          Page 46 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nadjudication and decision on the amount due and payable by\n\nthe person giving the Bank Guarantee. The Courts should not\n\ninterfere with invocation and encashment of Bank Guarantee\n\nunless there is fraud of egregious nature of which the\n\nbeneficiary seeks to take advantage and which vitiates the\n\nentire underlying transaction or a case where irretrievable\n\ninjustice is likely to be caused to either of the parties. That is\n\nto say, there must be special equities in favour of injunction\n\nsuch as when irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice\n\nwould occur if injunction were not granted.       Since in most\n\ncases payment of money under a Bank Guarantee would\n\nadversely affect the bank and its customer at whose instance\n\nthe guarantee is given, the harm or injustice contemplated\n\nunder this head must be of such an exceptional and\n\nirretrievable nature as would override the terms of the\n\nguarantee and the adverse effect of such an injunction on\n\ncommercial dealings in the country. There is no question of\n\nmaking out any prima facie case much less strong evidence or\n\nspecial equity for interference by way of injunction by the\n\ncourt in preventing encashment of Bank Guarantee. The bank\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                          Page 47 of 73</span>\n                                                      Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nmust honour Bank Guarantees free from interference by the\n\ncourts,   otherwise     trust    in   commerce,       internal        and\n\ninternational would be damaged irreparably. There has to be\n\nglaring circumstances of deception or fraud warranting\n\ninterference.    Final adjudication is not a pre-condition to\n\ninvoke the Bank Guarantee and that is not a ground to issue\n\ninjunction restraining the beneficiary from enforcing the Bank\n\nGuarantee.      The mere fact that the Bank Guarantee refers to\n\nthe principle agreement without referring to any specific\n\nclause in the preamble of the deed of guarantee does not make\n\nthe guarantee furnished by the bank to be a conditional one.\n\nThe present case can be examined in the light of these\n\nprinciples.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">32.

It is important to note that the Bank Guarantee further\n\nclearly states that the Guarantor Bank shall make payment on\n\nfirst    demand     without     restriction   or   condition        and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                            Page 52 of 73</span>\n                                                       Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nnotwithstanding any objection by Essar Power (Shapoorji in\n\nthe other case) and/or any other person and the Guarantor\n\nBank shall not require the Procurer (GUVNL) to justify the\n\ninvocation of the Bank Guarantee, nor shall the Guarantor\n\nBank have any recourse against the Procurer in respect of any\n\npayment made under the Bank Guarantee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">35.   It is further asserted that the Bank Guarantee shall be a\n\nprimary obligation of the Guarantor Bank and Procurer shall\n\nnot be obliged to before enforcing it to take any action in any\n\nCourt or arbitral proceedings against Seller (Essar Power or\n\nShapoorji) or to give any notice to the Seller.

Thus,   all    the   averments       clearly   bring     out      the\n\nunconditional       character   of   the     Contract     Performance\n\nGuarantees.     There can be no debate over this. The emphasis\n\nplaced on the words &#x27;as per the terms&#x27; found in the first\n\nparagraph to contend that it is conditional is totally misplaced.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                               Page 53 of 73</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">                                                        Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nA document has to be read as a whole and in the context of\n\nwhat precedes it and what follows it. Intent and purport of the\n\ndocument has to be gathered by reading it as a whole.                      It\n\ncannot be dissected.        So read, the Contract Performance\n\nGuarantees    clearly      reveal   their    unconditional         nature.\n\nPertinently, there is no mention of any particular clause or\n\narticles of the PPA in the Bank Guarantees.                      In such\n\ncircumstances, it is not possible to contend that the terms of\n\nthe PPA are incorporated in the Bank Guarantee.                           In\n\nMahatma      Gandhi     Sahakara       Sakkare         Karkhane and\n\nVinitec, the Supreme Court has clarified that a mere mention\n\nof the principle agreement in the Bank Guarantee without\n\nreferring to any specific clause thereof in the Bank Guarantee\n\ndoes not make it a conditional Bank Guarantee. It is true that\n\nthe Supreme Court has in the above cases referred to a\n\nsituation where the PPA was mentioned in the preamble. In\n\nthe present cases, the words &#x27;in terms of the PPA&#x27; are\n\nmentioned in the first introductory paragraph. So the same\n\nreasoning    would    be     applicable     to   the    instant       Bank\n\nGuarantees. However, in our opinion, the same reasoning will\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                                                Page 54 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\napply even to cases where there is a mere mention of the PPA\n\nanywhere in the body of the Bank Guarantee without quoting\n\nthe articles thereof. In such situation, it cannot be said that\n\nbecause there is a reference to the PPA, PPA overrides the\n\nBank Guarantee or it controls the Bank Guarantee. The Bank\n\nGuarantees   in   the   present   cases   are   very    clear     and\n\nunambiguous. Their unconditional nature is unquestionable.\n\nRule of Contra Proferentem on which Mr. Kapur has relied\n\nupon is attracted only when there is any ambiguity in the\n\ninterpretation of a document.       Sans any ambiguity, this\n\ndoctrine has no application to the instant Bank Guarantees.\n\nThis submission must, therefore, be rejected.          We have no\n\nhesitation in recording a conclusion that the Contract\n\nPerformance Guarantees in this case are unconditional.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">37.   During the course of arguments, counsel urged that\n\ninvocation of the Bank Guarantees will have to be stayed as\n\nthere is existence of fraud. To examine this submission, we\n\nhave carefully gone through the I.A. Nos.3 and 4 of 2017 filed\n\nby Essar Power and Shapoorji before the State Commission\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                          Page 55 of 73</span>\n                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nand present applications viz. I.A. Nos.383 and 384 of 2017\n\nfiled by them in this Tribunal. We find that there is absolutely\n\nno mention of fraud in any of these applications.          Alleging\n\nfraud is a serious matter.     It is well settled that material\n\nparticulars of fraud have to be set out. There is not a whisper\n\nabout fraud in the applications. The facts of this case disclose\n\nthat GUVNL has gone on extending time to fulfil Conditions\n\nSubsequent.    Later, it asked Essar Power and Shapoorji to\n\nfurnish additional Contract Performance Guarantee of Rs.80\n\ncrores so that time can be extended.       Number of request\n\nletters were sent.       During this correspondence, though\n\nadditional    Contract    Performance   Guarantee       was       not\n\nfurnished, time was extended and ultimately, letters were\n\nwritten that if additional Contract Performance Guarantees are\n\nnot furnished, PPAs will be terminated and Bank Guarantees\n\nwill be invoked and encashed.     Therefore, Essar Power and\n\nShapoorji had enough notice of likelihood of Bank Guarantees\n\nbeing invoked and encashed.         If there was any fraud,\n\nparticulars thereof ought to have been set out in the\n\napplications or at least the applications could have been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                         Page 56 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\namended.     Interpretation of articles of the PPA and action\n\ntaken thereunder by GUVNL cannot be termed as fraudulent.\n\nEven that is not stated in the applications. No foundation for\n\nfraud is laid in the applications.    Submissions made across\n\nthe bar are therefore not supported by pleadings. It was urged\n\nthat during the hearing of the matters before the State\n\nCommission a statement was made by the officers of GUVNL\n\nthat Bank Guarantees would not be encashed but contrary to\n\nthis statement, Termination Notices were sent and threat was\n\ngiven that Bank Guarantees would be encashed.                    This\n\nallegation is denied on affidavit by GUVNL.      This can by no\n\nmeans be described as fraud. In the circumstances, we reject\n\nthe submission that there is any fraud in these cases.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">38.   So far as allegation of irretrievable injustice or injury or\n\nspecial equity is concerned, we do not find any foundation laid\n\nby the applicants to substantiate it.     Moreover, irretrievable\n\ninjustice, harm or injury or special equity must be of such an\n\nexceptional nature as would override the terms of the\n\nGuarantee and the adverse effect of an injunction being\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                          Page 57 of 73</span>\n                                                         Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\ngranted restraining encashment of Bank Guarantee on\n\ncommercial dealings in the country. We have already quoted\n\nthe observations of the Supreme Court to the above effect in\n\nU.P. State Sugar Corporation.              The Supreme Court has\n\nclarified in this case that in most cases, payment of money\n\nunder a Bank Guarantee would adversely affect the bank and\n\nits customer, but for an injunction to be granted case of\n\nexceptional nature has to be made out.              We may quote yet\n\nanother paragraph from <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_35\">the said judgment</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">     &quot;14. On the question of irretrievable injury which is the\n     second exception to the rule against granting of injunctions\n     when unconditional bank guarantees are sought to be realised\n     the court said <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_36\">in <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_37\">the above case</a></a> that the irretrievable injury\n     must be of the kind which was the subject-matter of the\n     decision in the Itek Corpn. case. In that case an exporter in\n     USA entered into an agreement with the Imperial Government\n     of Iran and sought an order terminating its liability on stand\n     by letters of credit issued by an American Bank in favour of\n     an Iranian Bank as part of the contract. The relief was sought\n     on account of the situation created after the Iranian revolution\n     when the American Government cancelled the export licences\n     in relation to Iran and the Iranian Government had forcibly\n     taken 52 American citizens as hostages. The US Government\n     had blocked all Iranian assets under the jurisdiction of United\n     States and had cancelled the export contract. The Court\n     upheld the contention of the exporter that any claim for\n     damages against the purchaser if decreed by the American\n     Courts would not be executable in Iran under these\n     circumstances and realisation of the bank guarantee/letters of\n     credit would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff. This\n     contention was upheld. To avail of this exception, therefore,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                                 Page 58 of 73</span>\n                                                        Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\n      exceptional circumstances which make it impossible for the\n      guarantor to reimburse himself if he ultimately succeeds, will\n      have to be decisively established. Clearly, a mere\n      apprehension that the other party will not be able to pay, is\n      not enough. In Itek case there was a certainty on this issue.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">      Similar view has been taken by the Supreme Court in\n\nVinitec. Thus, to avail of the exception of irretrievable injury\n\nor special equity exceptional circumstances which make it\n\nimpossible for the Guarantor to reimburse himself, if he\n\nultimately succeeds, will have to be decisively established,\n\nwhich the Applicants have not done in this case.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">39.   Reliance    placed    by   the    Applicants     on    Hindustan\n\nConstruction Company is misplaced.               In our opinion, the\n\nsaid judgment cannot be applied to the facts of this case and\n\nhas been rightly distinguished by the State Commission.\n\nParagraphs 13 and 14 of the said judgment read as under:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      13. The Bank, in the above guarantee, no doubt, has used\n      the expression &quot;agree unconditionally and irrevocably&quot; to\n      guarantee payment to the Executive Engineer on his first\n      demand without any right of objection, but these expressions\n      are immediately qualified by following:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">            &quot;... in the event that the obligations expressed in\n            the said clause of the above-mentioned contract\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                Page 59 of 73</span>\n                                                          Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\n            have not been fulfilled by the contractor giving the\n            right of claim to the employer for recovery of the\n            whole or part of the advance mobilisation loan\n            from the contractor under the contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">      14. This condition clearly refers to the original contract\n      between HCCL and the defendants and postulates that if the\n      obligations, expressed in the contract, are not fulfilled by\n      HCCL giving to the defendants the right to claim recovery of\n      the whole or part of the &quot;advance mobilisation loan&quot;, then the\n      Bank would pay the amount due under the guarantee to the\n      Executive Engineer. By referring specifically to clause 9, the\n      Bank has qualified its liability to pay the amount covered by\n      the guarantee relating to &quot;advance mobilisation loan&quot; to the\n      Executive Engineer only if the obligations under the contract\n      were not fulfilled by HCCL or HCCL has misappropriated any\n      portion of the &quot;advance mobilisation loan&quot;. It is in these\n      circumstances that the aforesaid clause would operate and\n      the whole of the amount covered by the &quot;mobilisation\n      advance&quot; would become payable on demand. The Bank\n      Guarantee thus could be invoked only in the circumstances\n      referred to in clause 9 whereunder the amount would become\n      payable only if the obligations are not fulfilled or there is\n      misappropriation. That being so, the Bank Guarantee could\n      not be said to be unconditional or unequivocal in terms so\n      that the defendants could be said to have had an unfettered\n      right to invoke that guarantee and demand immediate\n      payment thereof from the Bank. This aspect of the matter\n      was wholly ignored by the High Court and it unnecessarily\n      interfered with the order of injunction, granted by the Single\n      Judge, by which the defendants were restrained from\n      invoking the bank guarantee.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_120\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">40.   The above paragraphs make it clear that the Bank\n\nGuarantee involved in the said case was conditional. Though\n\nthe    Bank      Guarantee        uses     the     expression         &quot;agree\n\nunconditionally and irrevocably&quot;, it is qualified with the\n\nexpression that &quot;......in the event that the obligations expressed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                                                   Page 60 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nin the said clause of the abovementioned contract have not been\n\nfulfilled by the contractor giving the right of claim to the\n\nemployer for recovery of the whole or part of the Advance\n\nMobilization Loan from the contractor under the contract&quot;.        The\n\nemployer was given a right of recovery of whole or part of the\n\nAdvance Mobilization Loan from the contractor under the\n\ncontract, if the contractor did not perform his obligations. The\n\nemployer had no unfettered right to invoke the Bank\n\nGuarantee.       Reliance placed on this judgment is, therefore,\n\nmisplaced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_122\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">41.   It was urged on behalf of the Applicants that the State\n\nCommission should have heard the main petition and\n\nexamined the case of Force Majeure. It was necessary to see\n\nwhether Bank Guarantees should have been ordered to be\n\nreturned.    It was necessary to compute the claim.        It is not\n\npossible    to    accept   this   submission.   Invocation        and\n\nencashment of Bank Guarantee is not dependent on the final\n\nadjudication of liability between the parties. If such a view is\n\ntaken the sanctity of Bank Guarantee will be eroded and there\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                          Page 61 of 73</span>\n                                                Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nwill be havoc in the commercial world.       We have already\n\nquoted relevant paragraph from Ansal Engineering where the\n\nSupreme Court has rejected this submission.      The Supreme\n\nCourt restated in this judgment that all the clauses of the\n\ncontract of the Bank Guarantee are to be read together; Bank\n\nGuarantee is an independent contract between the Bank and\n\nthe beneficiary and it does not depend on the result of the\n\ndispute between the person on whose behalf the Bank\n\nGuarantee was given by the bank and the beneficiary.              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1988070\" id=\"span_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"708879\" id=\"span_93\">In\n\ncoming to this conclusion, the Supreme Court drew support\n\nfrom its previous judgments in <a href=\"/doc/708879/\" id=\"a_38\">Hindustan Steel Workers\n\nConstruction Ltd.      v.

Heavy reliance was placed on behalf of the Applicants on\n\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court in Gangotri. We are of\n\nthe opinion that <a href=\"/doc/1988070/\" id=\"a_40\">the said judgment</a> is not applicable to this\n\ncase. We do not think that <a href=\"/doc/1988070/\" id=\"a_41\">in that case</a>, the Supreme Court\n\ntook a different view from the law settled by it in a catena of\n\njudgments crystallising principles underlying invocation and\n\nencashment of Bank Guarantees.       In fact, after referring to\n\nnumber of leading cases, which include U.P. State Sugar\n\nCorporation, the Supreme Court has in Gangotri said that,\n\nthese judgments lay down general principles relating to Bank\n\nGuarantees and there can be no quarrel over the propositions\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1988070/\" id=\"a_42\">laid down in</a> those cases. The Supreme Court then reiterated\n\nthat every case has to be decided with reference to the facts of\n\nthe case involved therein and then discussed the peculiar facts\n\nof the case before it. Reliance was placed by the Applicants on\n\nthe observations of the Supreme Court in this case that the\n\nsum claimed was neither an admitted sum, nor a sum which\n\nwas adjudicated upon in any judicial proceedings.               It is\n\nsubmitted that even in this case, the sum is not adjudicated\n\nupon.    But it must be noted that this is not the only\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                         Page 63 of 73</span>\n                                                Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\ncircumstance that weighed with the Supreme Court.               The\n\nSupreme Court observed that the sum claimed by the\n\nRespondents from the Appellants therein did not relate to the\n\ncontract for which the Bank Guarantee had been furnished\n\nbut it related to another contract dated 22/08/2005 for which\n\nno Bank Guarantee had been furnished.       Perhaps the most\n\nimportant fact which distinguishes it from other cases and\n\nwhich was noted by the Supreme Court was that the Bank\n\nGuarantee was in the nature of a Performance Guarantee\n\nfurnished for execution work of contract dated 14/07/2006,\n\nwhich was completed and the work having been completed to\n\nthe satisfaction of the Respondents, they had no right to\n\nencash the Bank Guarantee. Thus, this case turns on its own\n\npeculiar facts.   It does not take a view contrary to the view\n\ntaken by the Supreme Court in earlier judgments to which we\n\nhave made a reference that adjudication of claim is not a\n\nprecondition to invocation and encashment of a Bank\n\nGuarantee. Facts of Gangotri can never be equated with the\n\nfacts of the present case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100999643\" id=\"span_98\">We may advantageously refer to the\n\nDelhi High Court&#x27;s judgment in <a href=\"/doc/100999643/\" id=\"a_43\">TRF Limited        v.

In Roadways Solutions India Private Limited                 v.\n\nReliance Infrastructure Limited 16, the Bombay High Court\n\nhas held that unfair conduct of the contractor or possible\n\nfinancial crunch (financial civil death) which the person is\n\nlikely to suffer is no ground for issuing injunction order\n\nagainst encashment of Bank Guarantee. It is held that, it can\n\nbe a good ground to be urged before the arbitral tribunal. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_102\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_46\">BSES Ltd.

Fenner India\n\nLtd. &amp; Anr.</a> 17, while reiterating the well settled principles, the\n\nSupreme Court has held that indeed, as per the terms of the\n\nBank Guarantee itself, the Appellant therein was the best\n\njudge to decide as to when and for what reason the Bank\n\nGuarantee should be encashed and it is no function of the\n\nBank nor of the Supreme Court to enquire as to whether due\n\nperformance had actually happened when under the terms of\n\nthe Guarantee, the Bank was obliged to make payment when\n\nthe Guarantee was called in, irrespective of any contractual\n\ndispute between the parties. The Supreme Court noticed that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">16</span>\n     (2016) SCC Online Bom. 3496\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">17</span>\n     (2006) 2 SCC 728\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                            Page 66 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\narbitral proceedings were pending and observed that there was\n\nno case of irretrievable injustice, if the Appellant therein was\n\nallowed to encash the Bank Guarantee because justice can\n\nalways be rendered to the first Respondent therein, if it\n\nsucceeds before the Arbitrators.    On the same lines, we feel\n\nthat equities can be adjusted and relief can be given to the\n\nApplicants   if   they   succeed   in   the   pending     petitions.\n\nEncashment of Bank Guarantees cannot be stayed on that\n\nground.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">46.   Our attention is drawn to the various clauses of the PPA\n\nrelating to Force Majeure, return of Bank Guarantee, etc. It is\n\npointed out by Mr. Sen that in terms of Article 3.4.3 and\n\nArticle 11.5.1 of PPA dated 15/05/2010, the Procurer has an\n\nobligation to release/return the Bank Guarantee to the Seller\n\nif the Seller is able to establish that the termination is on\n\naccount of Force Majeure Events. It is submitted that when\n\nthe issue as to whether Force Majeure Events have occurred or\n\nnot is pending, GUVNL cannot unilaterally invoke the Bank\n\nGuarantee as that would render Articles 3.4.3 and 11.5.1 of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                                          Page 67 of 73</span>\n                                               Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nthe PPA otiose. All these issues, in our opinion, arise in the\n\ndispute between GUVNL on the one hand and Essar Power\n\nand Shapoorji on the other hand and cannot be used to stall\n\nthe invocation and encashment of Bank Guarantees. Mr. Sen\n\nsubmitted that in the PPA an exit route was available to Essar\n\nPower.   Essar Power had issued Termination Notice dated\n\n19/05/2015 to GUVNL terminating the PPA but GUVNL forced\n\nit to withdraw the termination notice by threatening that it\n\nwould issue a termination notice and invoke the Bank\n\nGuarantee. The exit route which was provided in the PPA was\n\nnot made available to Essar Power by issuing threats.         This\n\nsubmission is not raised either in the applications before the\n\nState Commission or in the present applications. In any case,\n\nMr. Ramachandran, learned counsel for GUVNL has stated\n\nthat this submission which is raised for the first time is\n\ncanvassed without stating the implication of the extensive\n\ncorrespondence between the parties and the meetings held\n\nbetween the two sides. It appears that after the Termination\n\nNotice dated 19/05/2015 issued by Essar Power, meetings\n\nwere held between the two parties on 03/08/2015 and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                                       Page 68 of 73</span>\n                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\n23/09/2015.       Thereafter,   Essar   Power   withdrew          the\n\ntermination notice.   Thus, even this issue and other issues\n\ndiscussed above arise in the dispute between GUVNL and\n\nEssar Power and GUVNL and Shapoorji which will have to be\n\ndecided after considering all the attendant circumstances.\n\nThe Bank Guarantee is an independent contract between the\n\nBank and the beneficiary and, is absolute in nature and is not\n\nqualified or dependent on the dispute between the beneficiary\n\nand the party at whose instance it is given. We have already\n\nstated that this case does not fall in any of the exceptions\n\nwhere the encashment of Bank Guarantee can be stayed.\n\nTherefore, on account of the aforementioned disputes, the\n\nContract Performance Guarantees of the present case cannot\n\nbe stayed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">47.   It was urged that it was necessary for the State\n\nCommission to hear the main petition along with the interim\n\napplications. This is not a case where the State Commission\n\nwas required to consider the merits of the case at the stage of\n\nconsidering whether injunction restraining encashment of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                                         Page 69 of 73</span>\n                                                  Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nBank Guarantee should be granted or not. There is no fraud\n\nof egregious nature. No case of special equities or irreparable\n\nharm or injury is made out. Moreover, the Gujarat High Court\n\nhad not acceded to the request of Shapoorji that the main\n\npetition should be heard on merits and, therefore, the\n\napplication containing the said prayer was withdrawn by\n\nShapoorji. Besides, while directing that main matter should\n\nbe disposed of by the State Commission, the Gujarat High\n\nCourt has expressed that it will be open to the State\n\nCommission to dispose of the interim applications.           Interim\n\nApplication Nos.3 and 4 of 2017 were therefore taken up for\n\nhearing. The counsel also proceeded with the applications as\n\nthe Record and Proceedings show.         We find nothing wrong\n\ntherefore in the State Commission taking up the interim\n\napplications for hearing and disposal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">48.   In the ultimate analysis, we are of the view that the State\n\nCommission&#x27;s orders are well reasoned and are perfectly legal.\n\nThey merit no reversal.    We, however, make it clear that all\n\nobservations made by us on facts of the case are made for the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                                          Page 70 of 73</span>\n                                                Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\ndisposal of the interim applications. Needless to say that the\n\nState Commission shall dispose of the pending proceedings\n\nindependently, and in accordance with law.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">49.   In view of the above, I.A. No.383 of 2017 and I.A. No.384\n\nof 2017 are dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">50.   Before parting, we must mention a fact which was\n\ndisclosed to us by Mr. Kapur, learned counsel appearing for\n\nShapoorji. It appears that Shapoorji filed a commercial suit\n\nbeing Commercial Suit (L) No.300 of 2017 in the Bombay High\n\nCourt against ICICI Bank Limited.     A notice of motion was\n\ntaken out in that suit being Notice of Motion (L) No.301 of\n\n2017. The motion was moved before learned Single Judge in\n\nVacation on 24/05/2017. Shapoorji appears to have prayed\n\nfor injunction restraining the Bank from making payment\n\npursuant to the invocation of Bank Guarantee at the request\n\nof GUVNL. Statement was made by the counsel for ICICI Bank\n\nthat the matter is scheduled for hearing before this Tribunal\n\non 25/05/2017 and, hence, Bank may not proceed on\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                        Page 71 of 73</span>\n                                                 Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\nGUVNL&#x27;s request for invocation of Bank Guarantee till\n\n27/05/2017.         In view of this statement, the Bombay High\n\nCourt did not grant any interim relief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_143\">51.   Mr. Kapur, learned counsel submitted that the Bank is\n\nnot a party to the present proceedings, hence, suit was filed in\n\nthe Bombay High Court. Mr. Ramachandran, learned counsel\n\nfor GUVNL made a serious grievance that when the Bank\n\nGuarantee clearly states that the ICICI Bank has registered\n\noffice at Vadodara and that the courts at Vadodara shall have\n\nexclusive jurisdiction, assuming such a suit could have been\n\nfiled, it should have been filed in Vadodara. Mr. Ramachandra\n\nsubmitted that several proceedings were filed by the parties in\n\nthe Gujarat High Court.         Shapoorji could have therefore\n\napproached the Gujarat High Court. When interim relief was\n\nalready granted by this Tribunal and the matter was fixed for\n\nhearing, the Applicant ought not to have tried to overreach\n\nthis Tribunal.      We find some substance in this submission.\n\nWe are a little anguished at this conduct of Shapoorji.           We\n\nleave it at that.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                         Page 72 of 73</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">                                             Rider in Essar-Shapooji\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">52.
