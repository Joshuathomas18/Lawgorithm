All contracts contained  the  following\nclause for payment\n\t      &quot;Payment\tto be made in cash in  exchange\t for\n\t      Delivery\tOrders\ton Sellers, or\tfor  Railway\n\t      Receipts or for Dock&#x27;s Receipts or for  Mate&#x27;s\n\t      Receipts (Which Dock&#x27;s or Mate&#x27;s Receipts\t are\n\t      to  be handed by a Dock or Ship&#x27;$\t Officer  to\n\t      the Seller&#x27;s representatives.&quot;\nThe  appellant tendered to the respondents  &quot;Pucca  Delivery\nOrders&quot;\t on  different mills.  These pucca  delivery  orders\ncontained  a  stipulation that the mills were not  bound  to\nrecognise  any\ttransferee  except the\toriginal  buyer\t and\nfurther\t requires the transferee to give an  undertaking  to\nthe  mills that he will take delivery of the goods in  terms\nof  the contract between the mills and the  original  buyer.\nThe  appellant\twas not the original buyer  of\tthese  pacca\ndelivery  orders.   The respondents refused  to\t accept\t the\npucca  delivery orders tendered by the appellant or pay\t for\nthe same.  The appellant, therefore, instituted the  present\nsuit.  In para 19A of the plaint it was contended  that\t the\ndelivery  orders were valid by virtue of trade,\t custom\t and\nusage  of  the jute trade in Calcutta.\tThe  respondents  in\ntheir\twritten\t statement  contended  that  the   documents\ndescribed  as pucca delivery orders are not delivery  orders\nat  all,  and,\ttherefore, the tenders\twere  invalid.\t The\nrespondents  also  denied the existence of trade  custom  or\nusage as alleged.\nThe  learned  Trial Judge of the High Court  held  that\t the\npucca  delivery\t orders\t tendered by the  appellant  to\t the\nrespondents were not in conformity with the contacts between\nthe  parties.  He also held that the custom was not  proved;\nthat  the custom alleged was contrary to <a href=\"/doc/386855/\" id=\"a_4\">sections 18</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/230586/\" id=\"a_5\">23</a>\nof the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and also to the terms of\t the\nwritten contracts.\nIn  an appeal filed by the appellant the Division  Bench  of\nthe High Court confirmed the decision of the Single Judge.\nIn an appeal by certificate Beg, CJ. (concurring with  Gupta\nJ.)\nHELD  :\t 1.  The crux of the whole matter  was\twhether\t the\nplaintiff  had\tcarried\t out  what  it\thad  undertaken\t and\ntendered  the  delivery notes in respect of  the  contracts.\nThe  respondent did not bargain for delivery orders  contain\ning  reservations  or  conditions  entitling  the  mills  or\nsuppliers  to refuse delivery to the holder of the  delivery\norder,\tunless the defendants complied with such  other\t and\nadditional terms or conditions as the suppliers imposed.  It\nis difficult to see how any alleged custom, could modify the\nrequirement of law as\n220\nto  what  a  document  of title. is  or\t what  a  particular\ncontract is or what a particular delivery order means.\t The\nplea of custom set up by the plaintiff was not available  in\nthe face of express statutory provisions as well as specific\nterms of the contract between the parties.  Alleged  custom,\namounting  to ignoring or contravening the express terms  of\nagreements  or the operation of statutory  provisions  would\nobviously  be invalid.\tA custom could not be pleaded as  an\nanswer\tto the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1790262/\" id=\"a_6\">section 92</a> of the Evidence\t Act\nwhich  bar  oral  evidence to contradict, vary\tadd  to,  or\nsubtract  from the terms of an agreement.  Moreover, it\t has\nbeen  found by both the learned Trial Judge as well  as\t the\nDivision  Bench\t of  the High Court that there\tis  no\tsuch\nuniformity  of practice or usage about the forms  of  either\ncontracts  or  delivery orders or their implications  as  to\nannex  obligations  contained.\tin  a  particular  type\t  of\ndelivery  order to transactions in general.  The  defendants\nhad  to enter into direct separate contracts with the  mills\nbefore\t he  could  demand  deliveries.\t  Such\t conditional\ndelivery  orders  are certainly not documents  of  title  as\ndefined by <a href=\"/doc/619100/\" id=\"a_7\">section 2(4)</a> of the Sale of Goods Act.

Union of India, [1965]  (3)  SCR\t 254\nreferred to.\n2.   The  defendants cannot be compelled to pay damages\t for\nalleged\t breach of contract when the delivery order was\t not\nwhat they contracted for.\nIn view of the above conclusion it is not necessary to\tdeal\nwith  the further question whether, the delivery orders,  if\nthey   authorised   the\t defendants   to   demand   delivery\nunconditionally,   would   still  not\tconstitute   a\t due\nperformance  of the contract between the parties  until\t the\ngoods had been ascertained. [227H, 228A.]\nGUPTA  J.  A delivery order is a document of  title  to\t the\ngoods according to <a href=\"/doc/619100/\" id=\"a_8\">section 2(4)</a> of the Sale of Goods Act.  A\ndelivery  order is an order by the owner of goods  directing\nthe  person who holds them on his behalf to deliver them  to\nthe person named in the order.\tIf the pucca delivery orders\nwere documents of title the defendant should have been\table\nto  get\t delivery  only\t by  lodging  them  with  the  mills\nconcerned  but\tthe  delivery orders  issued  by  the  mills\ncontain\t a  term  that\tthe mills  would  not  be  bound  to\nrecognise  a transferee.  The transferees have\tto  register\ntheir names with the mills as buyers and the mills insist on\nan application being made for that purpose.  Thus, the mills\ninsist\ton a new and separate contract that the holder of  a\npucca delivery order accept the obligations of the  original\nbuyer,\t which\tare  not  necessarily  identical  with\t the\nobligations  of the buyers under the contracts concerned  in\nthis  case.  The new contract insists on and includes  terms\nregarding  insurance  and  godown  charges  which  are\t not\nmentioned  in the contracts between the parties.   Thus\t the\npucca delivery orders were not documents of the title  under\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_9\">Sale of Goods Act</a> and were not in conformity with\twhat\nthe parties had contracted for. [230 F. G. 231A.  F]\n2.   The delivery orders did not relate to any specific\t lot\nof  goods.   It is well established that title\tcannot\tpass\nuntil the goods are ascertained in view of <a href=\"/doc/386855/\" id=\"a_10\">section 18</a> of the\nSale of Goods Act.

The contention of the plaintiff that the defendant riot\nhaving\traised\tthe plea in their  correspondence  with\t the\nplaintiff that the delivery orders tendered were  defective,\nwere  estopped\tfrom  justifying their\trepudiation  of\t the\ncontracts  on that ground is negatived.\t The  plaintiff\t did\nnot plead the case of estoppel and was, therefore,  debarred\nfrom raising the contention.  Even otherwise the law permits\na  defendant to justify the repudiation on any ground  which\nexists at the time of repudiation whether or not the  ground\nwas stated in the correspondence. [233A. 234A-B]\nNune  Sivayya  v.  Maddu  Ranganayakulu,  62  I.A.  89\t(98)\napproved.\nKAILASAM J. (Dissenting).\n1.   In\t  the  original\t written  statement  the   defendant\ncontended  that the bought and sold chits and contracts\t are\ninvalid and void as hit by the provision of <a href=\"/doc/167034268/\" id=\"a_11\">West Bengal Jute\nGoods  Act, 1950</a>.  Therefore, on the original pleadings\t the\nquestion  as to whether the delivery order was according  to\nthe  contract  was  not in dispute.  Four  years  after\t the\noriginal plaint was filed the appellant sought amendment  of\nthe  plaint.   By this amendment, the  appellant  reiterated\nthat  the tenders made by the appellant of the\tmills  pucca\ndelivery  orders  were duly made in terms  of  the  contract\nbetween\t the  parties An Additional  Written  Statement\t was\nfiled  by  the\tdefendant contending that  the\tmills  pucca\ndelivery orders were not delivery orders at all and, in\t any\nevent,\tthe  appellant\thad no title to any  of\t them.\t The\ndefinition of document of title to goods under <a href=\"/doc/619100/\" id=\"a_12\">section\t2(4)</a>\nis an inclusive definition.  A document which is used in the\nordinary  course  of business as proof of  possession  would\nsatisfy the definition as also a document which would enable\nthe possessor to receive the goods thereby represented.\t The\ntransfer of title is therefore, not relevant.  The  document\nof title to goods need not be confined to specific goods for\nit  may\t relate\t to  goods which  are  not  specified.\t The\nproperty in the goods is not transferred to the buyer unless\nand until the goods are ascertained but the contention\tthat\nunless\tby  the document the property in  the  goods  passes\nthere  could  be no document of title  cannot  be  accepted.\n[237B-C, D, 239A, B.

The  plea\tof the appellant that  the  delivery  orders\ntendered  in  respect of the contracts\tare  proper  tenders\nwould  have  to\t be accepted since  the\t possession  of\t the\ndocuments entitles to receive the goods thereby represented.\n[243-B]\nBhiniayya  v. The Government of Andhra Pradesh,\t [1961]\t (3)\nSCR 267 at 270 applied.\n222\n3.   The plea of the appellant is that the delivery order is\nin accordance with the contract and that the respondent knew\nthat the delivery order was in accordance with the  contract\nand   that   he\t wanted\t to  avoid  the\t  contract   without\njustification as the prices had fallen. [244A-B]\n4.   In\t  the  original\t written  statement  there  was\t  no\nchallenge  to  the  validity of the  delivery  orders.\t The\nparties to the suit are bound by the procedure prescribed in\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_13\">the  Code  of  Civil Procedure</a>.\t <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_14\">Order VIII  of\t the  C.P.C</a>.\nprovides  what\ta written statement should  contain.   Order\nVIII  rule  2 requires that a defendant must  raise  by\t his\npleading  all  matters\twhich  show  +he  suit\tnot  to\t  be\nmaintainable  or  that\tthe transaction is  either  void  or\nvoidable in point of law and all such grounds of defence as,\nif not raised, would be likely to take the opposite party by\nsurprise.   Rule 3 requires that it shall not be  sufficient\nfor  a defendant in his written statement to deny  generally\nthe grounds alleged by the plaintiff but the defendant\tmust\ndeal  specifically with each allegation of fact of which  he\ndoes  not  admit the truth except damages.  The\t failure  to\nquestion  the validity of the delivery order on\t the  ground\nthat  it  required registration with the mill  or  that\t the\npossessor was bound to give an undertaking, would be failure\nto  comply  with  the  requirements  of\t Order\tVIII.\t The\npleadings  of  the original side of the High Court  must  be\nstrictly construed. [245B, G-246A-B]\nBadat &amp; Co. v. West India Trading Co., A.I.R. 1964 S.C.\t 538\nfollowed.\n5.   The respondent had ample opportunity to put forward his\nobjections to the delivery order in the correspondence\tthat\nwas  exchanged\tbetween\t the  parties  or  in  the   written\nstatement  as originally filed.\t On the pleadings itself  it\nappears\t that the defence is without substance\tand  belated\nand  put forward for the purpose of escaping the  liability.\n[246-D-E]\n6.   The defendant not receiving the delivery orders and not\nraising\t the plea. specifically is more in  accordance\twith\nhis  having  been satisfied with the delivery  orders  being\naccording to contract and his refusal to accept the delivery\norders was to avoid the loss due to fall in price.  The fact\nthat  3\t contracts,  relating  to  2  deliveries  have\tbeen\naccepted  shows\t that  the  respondent\twas  following\t the\npractice   prevalent   in  Calcutta  by\t  the\tJute   Mills\nAssociation. [246F, G.]\n7.   Taking into account the fact that the appellant as well\nas the respondent were engaging themselves in the jute trade\nin Calcutta and were following generally the practice of the\njute   mills  Association  and\thad  entered  into   various\ncontracts  and having business relationship, the  conclusion\nis  irresistible that the respondent was familiar  with\t the\ndelivery order with the conditions and accepted&quot; it as being\nin use in the ordinary course of business.  It is  difficult\nto  accept  the\t plea  that  the  delivery  order  was\t not\nnegotiable  or that it was not in terms of the contract\t and\nthat it would not have enabled him to take possession of the\ngoods.\t The delivery orders were according to the terms  of\nthe  contract  and the respondent was aware  of\t them..\t The\nquestion  is  not one of estoppel but the  inference  to  be\ndrawn from the conduct of the respondent.  The pleadings  as\nwell  as  the conduct lead one to the  conclusion  that\t the\ndelivery  orders were in accordance with the contract  which\nthe  respondent\t accepted as mills  pucca  delivery  orders.\n[247H-248A-B, G]\nIn  view  of the majority judgment the appeal  is  dismissed\nwith costs.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">CIVIL  APPELLATE  JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal  No.  2166  of\n1968.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">From  the  Judgment  and  Decree  dated\t 26-4-1966  of\t the\nCalcutta High Court in Appeal No. 263 of 1959.\nY.

The difference arises,\nI  find,  primarily from divergent interpretations  of\twhat\nwas, pleaded by the parties.  What Kailasam J. considers  as\nhaving\tbeen admitted in the pleadings, by implication,\t was\nassumed\t by  Gupta  J.\tto be the matter  put  in  issue  by\npleadings of the two sides which had to be decided.\nAfter having considered the pleadings of the parties, I\t am,\nunable to agree, with great respect, with my learned brother\nKailasam  that\tthis case can be decided in  favour  of\t the\nplaintiff on the pleadings of the parties.  It is true\tthat\nthe defendant admits the contract under which goods were  to\nbe  delivered  to the defendant under delivery notes  to  be\nsupplied by the plaintiff for which payments were to be made\nby the defendant.  But, that did not mean that the defendant\naccepted  what\tthe  plaintiff alleges to  be  the  contract\nbetween the parties with all its alleged implications.\t The\ncrux  of  the  whole matter was whether\t the  plaintiff\t had\ncarried\t out  what it bad undertaken and  tendered  delivery\nnotes  in  respect  of the contracts still left\t for  us  to\nconsider so as to comply with the conditions of the contract\nreally admitted by the defendant.  In other words, there  is\na  dispute  on what the parties understood the\tcontract  to\nprovide or mean.  While the defendant accepts that there was\na contract, he does not accept the plaintiff&#x27;s version about\nits  due compliance by the plaintiff and a breach of  it  by\nthe  defendant.\t If this had not been so there could  be  no\ndispute.   The whole dispute revolved round the\t question  :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Was  tender of delivery ,variance with the contract  between\nthe parties ?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">The plaintiff realized fully that the difficulty in the\t way\nofan acceptance of its case was caused by the  additional\nconditions  sought to be attached to actual delivery by\t the\ndelivery orders tendered   by it.It,  therefore,   amended\nthe plaint by adding as follows :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t      &quot;19A.

N.\t Ray\n(as  he\t then  was),  of  the  Calcutta\t High  Court,\tthen\nconsidered the whole of the law and evidence on these issues\nat  considerable length and held that the plaintiff did\t not\ntender\tthe delivery orders in accordance with the terms  of\nthe  contract between the parties.  &#x27;the defendant &#x27;did\t not\nbargain\t for  delivery\torders\tcontaining  reservations  or\nconditions  entitling  the  mills  or  suppliers  to  refuse\ndelivery  to  the holder of the delivery  order\t unless\t the\ndefendant  complied with such other and additional terms  or\nconditions  as\tthe suppliers imposer his,according  to\t the\ndefendant, was &quot;no delivery order&quot;. It was only an offer  to\ndeliver\t  if  certain  conditions  are\tfulfilled  and\t new\nliabilities  undertaken.  The contract between\tthe  parties\nwas   for  delivery  without  such  additional\t terms\t and\nliabilities.  This was the short and simple question decided\nupon documentary evidence before the Court.\nIt  is difficult to see how any alleged custom could  modify\nthe requirements of law as to what a &quot;document of title&quot;  is\nor  what  a  particular contract is  or\t what  a  particular\ndelivery order means. It could not help a legally  defective\ndocument  to  overcome\tthe basic legal defect\tdue  to\t its\nterms.\tIt  could  not override the specific  terms  of\t the\nactual contract between the parties.  It could not  validate\ndelivery, orders containing reservations derogating from the\nlegal  requirements  of a document of title.   The  plea  of\ncustom\tset  up\t by  the  plaintiff,  in  desperation,\t was\nobviously not available in the face of the express statutory\nprovisions  as\twell as the specific terms of  the  contract\nbetween\t the  parties.\t An  alleged  custom,  amounting  to\nignoring or contravening the express terms of agreements  or\nthe  operation of statutory provisions would, obviously,  be\ninvalid.  Surely, a custom could not be pleaded as an answer\nto  the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1790262/\" id=\"a_15\">section 92</a> of the Evidence  Act  which\nbar  oral evidence to contradict, vary, add to\tor  subtract\nfrom the terms of an agreement, although proviso (5) of sec-\ntion  92 allows &quot;any usage or custom by which incidents\t not\nexpressly  mentioned in any contract are usually annexed  to\ncontracts of that description&quot; to be proved.  Annexing usage\nor  custom  to\tthe express terms of the  contract  is\tvery\ndifferent   from  demolishing  the  original   contract\t  by\nsubstituting new terms which enable a party to a contract to\nget   over  its\t obligations  under  the  contract   itself,\nMoreover, it has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">227</span>\nbeen  found,  by  the learned trial Judge  as  well  as\t the\nDivision Bench of the Calcutta High Court, that there is  no\nsuch  uniformity  of practice or usage about  the  forms  of\neither contracts or delivery orders or their implications as\nto  annex  obligations\tcontained in a\tparticular  type  of\ndelivery  order\t to  transactions in  general  according  to\nvarious forms of contracts for purchase of jute.\nIt has been clearly found by Ray J., and the Division Bench,\nconsisting  of Sinha CJ. and Sen J., that the contracts\t now\nbefore\tus  (we are not concerned with other  contracts\t for\nwhich  decrees\tmay or may not have been  granted)  are\t for\n&quot;delivery  orders&quot; which are documents of title and not\t for\norders\twith conditions annexed to them which  prevent\tthem\nfrom  so operating.  On the express terms of these  delivery\norders\t, the suppliers of jute were not bound to  recognise\nthe  rights of the holder by mere endorsement of the  order.\nIt is only after the holder had applied for registration and\nundertaken payment of storage charges, and acknowledged\t the\nHen  of the supplying mills an the goods,  that\t the  holder\ncould acquire the right to delivery. In other words, he\t had\nto enter into direct separate contracts with themills\nbefore\t he,  could  demand  deliveries.

The   April   and\t May\ninstallments  of B twill and the April quota of\t hessian  do\nnot form the subject-matter of this appeal.\nIt  is\tnot  disputed that all the  contracts  were  in\t the\nstandard forms of the Indian Jute Mills Association.

It has\nbeen  mentioned already that the scope of the appeal  before\nus is not co-extensive,with the reliefs claimed in the\tsuit\nbut  narrower.\tWe have not therefore referred to the  other\nissues in the suit or the other things recorded\t by the High\nCourt which are not relevant for the present purpose.\nWere the pucca delivery orders tendered by the plaintiff  in\nconformity  with what the parties contracted for ?  If\tnot,\nthe  defendant\tcommitted no breach by\trefusing  to  accept\nthem. These pucca delivery orders, as already mentioned, had\nbeen  issued  by  the  mills.  The  payment  clause  in\t the\ncontracts  provides  for payment in  exchange  for  delivery\norders\ton sellers.  Here, the sellers were  the  plaintiff-\nand not the mills.  A contention rejected by the High Court-\nand repeated in this Court is that where the contracts speak\nof  &quot;delivery orders on sellers&quot;, &#x27;the reference is  to\t the\noriginal sellers, namely, the mills.  In a contract for sale\nof goods, the word seller must obviously refer to the  party\nselling under the contract unless there is anything &#x27;in\t the\ncontext\t suggesting  otherwise.\t  There is  nothing  in\t the\nclause\trequiring one to read the word sellers to  mean\t the\noriginal  sellers and not the sellers under  the  contracts,\nand  this is one of the reasons why the High Court held,  in\nour  opinion &#x27;rightly, that the pucca delivery orders  which\nwere  offered  were  not in compliance\twith  the  contracts\nbetween\t the parties.  More important is the  question,\t did\nthese  pucca delivery orders enable the defendant to  obtain\ndelivery  of  the  goods  from the mills  in  terms  of\t the\ncontracts  ?   A  delivery  order is  a\t document  of  title\naccording to the definition of &quot;document of title to  goods&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">in <a href=\"/doc/619100/\" id=\"a_25\">section 2(4)</a> of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.\t A  delivery\norder  is an his behalf to deliver them to the person  named\nin the order.If\t the pucca delivery orders were\t documents\nof title, the defendantshould\thave  been  able  to   get\ndelivery only by lodging them with themills\tconcerned.\nBut these delivery orders issued by the mills contain a term\nthat the mills would not be bound to recognise a transferee.\nIt  appears  from  the evidence\t that  transferees  have  to\nresister their names with the mills as buyers, and for\tthis\npurpose the mills insist on an application being made in the\nfollowing form (Ext.  DDD)\n\t\t    &quot;Dear Sirs,\n\t\t    In\t requesting  you to register us\t  as\n\t      the Holders   of the\tabove\t    Delivery\n\t      Order(s)\twe  agree that\tall  contract  terms\n\t      covering\tit are to be applicable and to\thave\n\t      been   signed  by\t us  that  we\taccept\t all\n\t      obligations of  the original Buyers.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\t       231</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">Thus  the mills insist on a new and separate contract,\twith\nthe   holder  of  a  pucca  delivery  order  accepting\t the\nobligations of the original buyer which are not\t necessarily\nidentical  with\t the  obligations of  the  buyer  under\t the\ncontracts concerned in this case. The,new contract  insisted\non  includes  terms regarding insurance and  godown  charges\nwhich  are  not\t mentioned  in\tthe  contracts\tbetween\t the\nparties. As an illustration, the High Court has referred  to\none such delivery order (Ext. 1) issued by the Fort  Gloster\nJute Mill which contains      these terms :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\t      &quot;(i)  That the company shall not be  bound  to\n\t      recognise any transfer thereof.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\t      (ii)  That  the goods are held  covered  under\n\t      the company&#x27;s Insurance policies against\trisk\n\t      of  fire while at the Mill until 1st  October,\n\t      1952, after which date a charge of eight annas\n\t      per  bale\t per  month will be  levied  by\t the\n\t      company for this purpose until removal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\t       (iii)  That  on and after  the  1st  October,\n\t      1952, the company will charge a godown rent of\n\t      eight annas per bale per month for the purpose\n\t      until removal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\t      (iv) That the company has a lien on the  goods\n\t      for the  above charges.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"488350\" id=\"span_14\">It  thus appears that the pucca delivery orders did not,  as\ntheHigh\t Court has found, entitle the defendant to  obtain\ndelivery fromthe  mills in terms of the contracts  between\nthe  parties to the suit&#x27;.The term &#x27;delivery order&#x27;  in\t its\nnatural sense would not include delivery orders of the\tkind\ntendered  by the plaintiff, and there is nothing to  suggest\nthat  the parties while agreeing on payment in exchange\t for\n&#x27;delivery orders&#x27; used the term in any other sense, It\tmust\ntherefore  be held that the pucca delivery orders  were\t not\ndocuments of title under the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_26\">Sale of Goods Act</a> and were\t not\nin conformity with what the parties had contracted for.\nThere  is yet another reason why the pucca  delivery  orders\ncannot\tbe  taken  as documents of  title.   These  delivery\norders\tdid not relate to any specific lot of goods.  It  is\nwell established that title cannot pass until the goods\t are\nascertained in view of <a href=\"/doc/386855/\" id=\"a_27\">section 18</a> of the Sale of Goods\tAct,\n1930. (see <a href=\"/doc/488350/\" id=\"a_28\">Jute, and Gunny Brokers Ltd. and another v. Union\nof  India  and\tothers</a>.(1)  It\twas  argued  that  requisite\nquantities of goods were lying in the mills&#x27; godown when the\npucca  delivery\t orders\t were issued  which  was  sufficient\nascertainment within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/386855/\" id=\"a_29\">section 18</a>.\t It  appears\nfrom the Judgment of the learned single Judge as also of the\nDivision Bench of the High Court that no responsible officer\nof the mills came forward to prove this.  But even  assuming\nthat themills&#x27;\tgodowns\t had sufficient\t quantities  of\t B\ntwill and hessian when thepucca\t delivery  orders   were\nissued, the requirement is not satisfied. Here\t      the\ncontracts  were\t for  the sale\tof  unascertained  goods  by\ndescription.\t   <a href=\"/doc/230586/\" id=\"a_30\">Section  23</a>\tof the\tSale  of  Goods\t Act\nprovides\n(1)[1961] 3 S.C.R. 820.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">232</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">that  in such cases, if goods of that description and  in  a\ndeliverable  state are unconditionally appropriated  to\t the\ncontract by the seller with the express or implied assent of\nthe  buyer, the property in the goods passes to\t the  buyer.\nThe  assent  may  be  given  either  before  or\t after\t the\nappropriation is made.\tBut here the plaintiff, who was\t the\nseller, did not have the necessary control over the goods to\nbe  able to appropriate them to the contracts even with\t the\nconsent of the buyer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">It  was\t next claimed that such pucca  delivery\t orders\t are\ntendered  and accepted following the trade custom and  usage\nin the Calcutta jute market.  It was suggested that the fact\nthat the contracts were in the standard forms of the  Indian\nJute  Manufacturers&#x27;  Association was an indication  of\t the\nexisting custom.  The forms are however not uniform.  It has\nbeen  found  by the High Court that they differ\t in  several\nparticulars. The learned single Judge who disposed of  the\nsuit and the DivisionBench  that heard the  appeal  have\nfound that no such custom or usagehas  been proved  on\tthe\nevidence.   I find no reason to\t reconsider this finding  of\nfact.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">It has been argued that several decisions of this Court\t and\none  of the Calcutta High Court accept the existence of\t the\ncustom alleged in the plaint.  The learned single Judge\t who\ndecided the suit pointed out referring to the observation of\nLord Birkenhead in Les Affreteurs Reunis Societe Anonyme  v.\nLeopold Walford (London) Limited(1) that a custom proved  in\none  case should not be utilised to found facts in  another.\nI  do not think that any of the decisions relied on  by\t the\nappellant in support of this contention finds that it is the\ncustom\tof jute trade in Calcutta to accept  pucca  delivery\norders\tof  the kind we are concerned with in this  case  as\ndocument  of title.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1064864\" id=\"span_16\">In the Calcutta case, <a href=\"/doc/1064864/\" id=\"a_31\">Anglo-India\tJute\nMills Co. v.

The claim in the plaint and\t the\nrespondent&#x27;s liability was generally denied.\nAccording  to the pleadings of the parties it is  seen\tthat\nthe  plaint allegations are that the contracts were  entered\ninto  in the standard I.J.M.A. forms which were\t annexed  to\nthe  plaint.   It was further alleged  &#x27;that  regarding\t the\ndelivery  of goods in April, 1952, in respect of  the  three\ncontracts the respondent entered into a settlement  contract\nand  paid  the\tappellant a sum of Rs.\t57,175\tas  per\t the\ncontract.   Regarding goods deliverable in May,\t 1952  under\nthe  three  contracts though the bills\twere  submitted\t the\nrespondent failed and neglected to pay the same.   Regarding\nthe  goods  deliverable under the three contracts  in  June,\n1952, it is alleged that the appellant duly and in terms  of\nthe contract tendered the delivery orders in respect of\t the\nsaid  goods for June delivery but the respondent  wrongfully\nfailed\tand  neglected to accept and to pay  for  the  same.\nRegarding the hessian contracts for the goods deliverable in\nApril, 1952, it is alleged that the appellant duly delivered\ndelivery  orders  and  the  respondent\tpaid  for  and\ttook\ndelivery of the same but failed and neglected to pay for and\ntake delivery of the goods deliverable in May and June 1952.\nIn  respect of the hessian deliverable in June, 1952, it  is\nalleged in the plaint that the appellant tendered the  pucca\ndelivery orders but the respondent failed&#x27; and neglected  to\naccept\tand pay for the said goods or delivery\torders.\t  It\nmay  be noted that the specific allegation in the plaint  is\nthat  regarding\t April delivery of Twills  under  the  three\ncontracts  the\tclaim  was  satisfied  by  the\trespondents.\nRegarding  the three contracts for goods deliverable in\t May\nit is alleged in the plaint that the appellant submitted the\nbills  but respondent did not honour it.  In Paragraph 9  of\nthe  plaint it is stated regarding the goods deliverable  in\nJune,  1952  that &quot;The plaintiff duly and in  terms  of\t the\ncontract tendered the Delivery Orders in respect of the said\ngoods  in  respect  of\tJune  Delivery\tbut  the   plaintiff\nwrongfully failed and neglected to accept and/or to pay\t for\nthe  same.&quot;The\tallegation  specifically  is  that  delivery\norders were tendered interms of the contract.

The reply to the specific allegations  referred\nto  in\tthe  various paragraphs of the plaint  is  that\t the\ndelivery  orders in the case of goods deliverable  in  April\nwere  paid  for and taken delivery of before,  the  relevant\ncontract  was discovered to be void.  The allegation by\t the\ndefence according to the written statement is that the\tres-\npondent discovered the Bought and Sold notes and  contracts,\nto  be invalid and void under the West Bengal Act V of\t1950\nin  that it related to a forward contract  prohibited  under\nlaw.   The&#x27;  allegations  in the plaint\t that  the  delivery\norders\twere issued according to the contract  were  nowhere\ndenied.\t The only defence was that the delivery orders\twere\nreceived and paid for in the case of April contracts  before\nrealising  that the contracts were void.  On the&#x27;  pleadings\ntherefore, the question as to whether the delivery order was\naccording to the contract was not in dispute.

The particulars of the customs and usage were set\nout  in four sub-paragraphs of Paragraph 19A of the  plaint.\nIn  Paragraph 19B the appellant alleged that the  respondent\nwas at all material times fully aware of the aforesaid Trade\ncustoms and usages and dealt with the appellant on the basis\nthereof.   An additional written statement was filed by\t the\nrespondent  on 9th December, 1957, in which he\tdenied\tthat\nthe  alleged tenders or any of them or the alleged  delivery\norders or any of them were in terms of the contracts between\nthe  parties.\tIt  was\t contended  that  the  Mills&#x27;  Pucca\nDelivery  Orders were not delivery orders at all and in\t any\nevent  the  appellant bad no title to any of them.   It\t was\nalso  contended\t that the delivery orders related  to  goods\ndeliverable  under contract between third parties  mentioned\nin the delivery orders and in any event the goods  mentioned\nin  the\t delivery orders are not goods\tof  the\t description\nmentioned in the contracts-between the parties and that when\nthe respondent called for the tender of inspection orders in\nterms  of  the contracts. the appellant\t wrongfully  and  in\nbreach\tof  contract  failed and  neglected  to\t tender\t any\ninspection  order.  The custom pleaded was also denied.\t  It\nwas  also  contended  that  the\t delivery  orders  were\t not\ntransferable   by  endorsement\tand  that  there   were\t  no\nappropriations\tof  the goods relating to  any\tcontract  or\ndelivery order.\t The respondent also denied that the customs\nor usage ever existed and in any event the customs or  usage\nis inconsistent with the terms of the written contracts\t and\nthat  it  was not right to allege that\tthe  respondent\t was\naware  of! any such customs and dealt with the appellant  on\nthat basis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">On  the amended plaint and the additional written  statement\nthe  suit  took a new turn and the outcome of the  suit\t was\nconsidered important\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">238</span>\nfor  the jute trade in Calcutta.

The  trial\ncourt framed 7 issues as set out at page 262 of the  printed\nPaper Book and answered them at page 304.

Regarding the custom or usage in  Calcutta\nthe trial court found that there was no such custom  proved.\nIt  also  recorded  that  the  appellant  had  no  title  to\ndocuments  described as Mills Pucca Delivery Orders.   These\nfindings were confirmed by the appellate court.\nThe Courts below negatived the custom or usage set up by the\nappellant.

It would further include an authorisation\neither by endorsement or by delivery which would enable\t the\npossessor  of  the document to transfer\t &#x27;Or  receive  goods\nthereby represented.  The definition is silent as to passing\nof title.  It would include an order for delivery of  goods.\nA document which is used in the ordinary course of  business\nas proof of possession would satisfy the definition as\talso\na  document which would enable the possessor to receive\t the\ngoods thereby represented.

That the delivery order is used in\t the\nordinary  course  of  business as proof\t of  possession\t and\ntransferable   by  endorsement\tor  by\tdelivery  has\tbeen\nrecognised  by\tCourts.\t  The  only  question  therefore  is\nwhether\t the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/619100/\" id=\"a_60\">section 2(4)</a> has been  fulfilled\nin  that  the  delivery\t orders\t which\twere  given  to\t the\nrespondent would have enabled the possessor of the documents\nto  transfer or receive the goods thereby represented.\t The\nrespondent&#x27;s main attack against the delivery orders is that\nthe  possessor of the documents could not receive the  goods\nunless\the fulfilled the conditions, namely that  he  should\nregister  with\tthe Mills, and sign an\tundertaking  to\t the\nMills  agreeing\t to be bound by the terms  of  the  contract\nbetween the original buyer and the seller.  The Mill is\t not\nbound  to recognise the buyer.\tThe trial court as  wall  as\nthe  appellate court found that these  conditions  negatived\nthe  plea  of  the appellant that the delivery\torder  is  a\ndocument of title to goods which would enable the  possessor\nto  take  delivery of the goods.  It is\t clear\tthat  before\nobtaining   possession\tthe  conditions\t will  have  to\t  be\nsatisfied and therefore it is not an unconditional order for\ndelivery and therefore will not satisfy the requirements  of\na  delivery order.  It may also be noted that the  appellant\nhas  not  succeeded in establishing any custom or  usage  or\npractice  in the jute trade that delivery orders  with\tsuch\nconditions are being accepted.\tNeither have the decision of\ncourts recognised any such practice.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">(2)  [1961] (3) S.C.R. 267 at 270.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_63\">3-1114 SCI/77\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">244</span>\nThese objections appear to be insurmountable and the  courts\nbelow took the view that the appellant cannot succeed as the\ndelivery  order\t is not unconditional and therefore  not  in\naccordance with the contract.  On a careful consideration of\nthe,  records  and hearing the arguments of the\t counsel  it\nappears,  that one important aspect was not duly  considered\nby the Courts below.  The plea of the appellant is that\t the\ndelivery  order is in accordance with the contract and\tthat\nthe   respondent  knew\tthat  the  delivery  order  was\t  in\naccordance with the contract and that he wanted to avoid the\ncontract as the prices had fallen without any justification.\nThe  contents of the plaint have been set out at  length  at\nthe  beginning\tof the judgment.  It may be noted  that\t the\nappellant and the respondent entered into several contracts.\nThe  first 3 contracts were entered into on  22nd  November,\n1st  December  and 10th December, 1951. Under  each  of\t the\ncontracts goods were to be delivered in April, May and June.\nThe rates specified are Rs. 206/. per 100 bags according  to\nthe  first contract, Rs. 210/4/- per 100 bags and Rs.  216/-\nper 100 bags respectively.  At the commencement of the first\nperiod\tof  delivery in April, 1952, it was found  that\t the\nrate  had fallen to Rs. 1551- per 100 bags.  The  margin  in\nthe  three  deliveries due in April under  the\t3  contracts\nresulted  in a loss of about Rs. 50,175 to  the\t respondent.\nThat this contract was under Indian Jute Mills&#x27;\t Association\nwas  not  disputed and accepting its full  implications\t the\nrespondent  paid  the  amount  under  settlement  contracts.\nRegarding  the delivery due in the month of May under the  3\ncontracts there was a Sold and Bought note exchanged between\nthe  parties  whereby the respondent agreed to sell  to\t the\nappellant   and\t the  appellant\t agreed\t to  buy  from\t the\nrespondent  90,000  bags of B Twills at Rs. 136/- per  1  00\nbags.  It may be noted that the price had come down  further\nfrom  Rs. 1551- in April to Rs. 136/- in May.  There was  no\nprotest\t and  for  the\tmonth of May  also  the\t goods\twere\ndelivered by the appellant to the respondent and back by the\nrespondent to the appellant.  Due to the fall in prices\t the\nappellant claimed Rs. 67,275/- and a decree had been  passed\nso far as that claim was concerned by the trial Court  which\nhas  become  final.  While the contract was accepted  and  a\nsettlement contract was affected on the basis of delivery of\ngoods by the appellant as regards April and May the  dispute\nis  as\tregards the goods deliverable in June  under  the  3\ncontracts.   Regarding\tall  the 3  contracts  the  first  2\ndeliveries due in April and May have not been disputed.\t For\nthe  delivery of goods under the 3 contracts in June,  1952.\nit is alleged in the plaint in Paragraph 9 as follows\n\t      &quot;The plaintiff further states that in  respect\n\t      of the Contracts\t   mentioned in paragraph  3\n\t      above  the defendant failed and  neglected  to\n\t      pay for and/or to take delivery of thegoods\n\t      which  were  deliverable under  the  aforesaid\n\t      contractsin  June 1952.  The plaintiff  duly\n\t      and  in  terms of the  contract  tendered\t the\n\t      Delivery\tOrders in respect of the said  goods\n\t      in respect of June Delivery but the  plaintiff\n\t      wrongfully  failed  and  neglected  to  accept\n\t      and/or to pay for the same.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">This is the crux of the appellant&#x27;s case. The answer to this\ncase is found in Paragraph 6 of the written statement  which\nis as follows\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">245</span>\n\t      &quot;The   defendant\t denies\t  each\t and   every\n\t      allegation contained in paragraphs 9, 1 0\t and\n\t      1\t 8 of the plaint as if the same is  set\t out\n\t      seriatim\tand specifically denied.  The  facts\n\t      and/or  validity of the alleged tender  and/or\n\t      the  alleged resale and or the alleged  notice\n\t      are denied.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">In  the written statement that was filed on  22nd November,\n1952,  the plea was that the respondent discovered that\t the\nBought and Sold notes and contracts were and are invalid and\nvoid as they were in contravention of the provisions of\t the\nWest  Bengal Act V of 1950.  While there is a  challenge  to\nBought\tand Sold notes and contracts as being void there  is\nno  challenge  as to the validity of  the  delivery  orders.\nWhile  the allegation in Paragraph 9 is specifically  denied\nit  does  not  say whether there was or there  was  not\t any\ntender\tof delivery orders and whether the  delivery  orders\nwere  in accordance with the contract or not.  Much less  is\nthere any reference to the delivery order requiring that  it\nshould be registered with the Mill or that an undertaking to\nabide  by the conditions was insisted upon in  the  delivery\norder.\t In the amended plaint Paragraph 19A was  introduced\nwherein the appellant reiterating that Mills&#x27; pucca delivery\norders\twere  made  in terms of the  contracts\tbetween\t the\nparties\t proceeded to state that in any event  the  delivery\norders\twere proper tenders by virtue of trade\tcustoms\t and\nusage  of  the Jute Trade in Calcutta.\t In  the  additional\nwritten\t statement  filed  on 9th  December,  1957,  further\nparticulars  in\t reply to Paragraph 19A of  the\t plaint\t are\ngiven in Paragraph 2- It is stated that the delivery  orders\nare not in terms of the contracts and that the appellant had\nno  title to them.  It is further stated that  the  delivery\norders on the face of them relate to goods deliverable under\nco  acts  between  third  parties,  mentioned  in  the\tsaid\ndelivery  orders, that the goods are not of the\t description\nas  mentioned in the contracts and that when the  respondent\ncalled\tfor  the  tender  of  inspection  orders appellant\nneglected to tender any.  In Paragraph 4 it was stated\tthat\nthe  delivery orders were not transferable  by\tendorsement.\nThough\tthe opportunity provided by the amended\t plaint\t was\navailed\t of  for challenging the validity  of  the  delivery\norder  which was not done in the original written  statement\nthe  challenge to the delivery order is not based on any  of\nthe  grounds  which  ultimately found  acceptance  with\t the\ncourts\tbelow,\tnamely\tthat  the  delivery  order  required\nregistration  with the Mills and required the  possessor  of\nthe  document to give an undertaking that he would abide  by\nthe conditions and that the Mill was not bound to  recognise\nthe transfer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1994047\" id=\"span_44\">The burden is no doubt on the appellant to prove his casebut\nthe  parties  to  the  suit  are  bound\t by  the   procedure\nprescribed in<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_61\">the  Code\tof Civil Procedure</a>.

If his  denial\n\t      of  a  fact is not specific but  evasive,\t the\n\t      said  fact shall be taken to be admitted.\t  In\n\t      such  an\tevent, the. admission  itself  being\n\t      proof, no other proof is necessary.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">The  respondent\t had ample opportunity to  put\tforward\t his\nobjections to the delivery order in the correspondence\tthat\nwas  exchanged\tbetween\t the  parties  or  in  the   written\nstatement  as  originally  filed.   The\t additional  written\nstatement  of course, gave another opportunity but  even  in\nthis respondent has failed to put forward the grounds  which\nhe  is\tin law required to do.\tOn the pleadings  itself  it\nappears.  that the defence is without substance and  belated\nand  put forward for the purpose of escaping the  liability.\nThe  three delivery orders regarding B Twill deliverable  in\nJune   on  the\tfirst  three  contracts,  and\tof   hessian\ndeliverable in June and regarding the last contract by which\nB  Twill  was deliverable in June, the\trespondent  did\t not\nreceive the delivery orders.  He did not wait to see whether\nthe  delivery orders were according to the contract or\tnot.\nThough\tthe respondent is entitled to raise  all  objections\nopen  to  him  under law that the delivery  orders  are\t not\naccording to contract, his not receiving the delivery orders\nand not raising the plea specifically is more in  accordance\nwith  his  having been satisfied with  the  delivery  orders\nbeing  according to contract and his refusal to\t accept\t the\ndelivery orders was to avoid the loss due to fall in  price.\nThis  conclusion  is  strengthened by his  conduct.   The  3\ncontracts  specified  in  Paragraph 3  of  the\tplaint\twere\nentered into in November and December, 1951, for delivery of\ngoods  in April, May and June, 1952.  The 3  contracts\twere\naccepted and proceeded with regarding April and May delivery\nin  that the validity of the contracts, the delivery by\t the\nappellant  and the delivery back by the respondent  are\t all\nadmitted and the appellant was awarded a decree accordingly.\nThe  dispute as already pointed out is, regarding  the\tJune\ndelivery and\n(1)  A.I.R. 1964 S..C. 538.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">247</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">the  plea that the delivery orders in respect of  the  goods\nrelating to June delivery were in terms of the contract\t was\nnot  specifically  denied. There were  several\ttransactions\nbetween the appellant and therespondent\t  which\t  will\t be\nreferred to presently and the contractswere entered into in\nthe  standard  I.J.M.A.\t Contract forms.  The  fact  that  3\ncontracts relating to two deliveries have been accepted show\nthat the respondent was following the practice prevalent  in\nCalcuttaby respondent agreed to buy from the appellant and\nthe  appellant\tagreed to sell to  the\trespondent  3,00,000\nyards  of hessian at Rs. 74/- per 100 yards  deliverable  in\nequal installments in April, May and June.  It is alleged in\nParagraph  14 of the plaint that he had duly  delivered\t the\ndeliveryorders\tand  the  respondent  paid  for\t and  took\ndelivery of the same.\t But   the   respondent\t  wrongfully\nfailed and neglected to pay and takedelivery  of   pucca\nMills Delivery Orders relating to goods deliverablein\nMay and June, 1952. In the written statement the  respondent\nstated\tthat the delivery orders delivered by the  appellant\nwere paid for and taken delivery of by the respondent before\nthe  relevant contract was discovered to be void.\t  In\nthe  written statement the respondent did not deny that\t the\nappellant  duly\t delivered  the\t delivery  orders  and\t the\nrespondent  paid  for  and took delivery  of  the  same\t but\npleaded that he paid and took delivery before he  discovered\nthat the relevant contract was void.  It is significant that\nthe attack was on the contract on the ground that it  became\nvoid because of the West Bengal\t   Act V of 1950.  There  is\nno  challenge against the delivery order. The contention  of\nthe appellant that the delivery\t  orders relatingto\tthe\npresent\t suit  were  the usual delivery\t orders\t which\twere\nprevalent  in the Jute Trade in Calcutta  appears  probable.\nNo  specific plea that the delivery orders relating  to\t the\nsuit were different from the deliveryorders   which   the\nrespondent accepted regarding the April delivery wasraised\nnor  was  it contended that the delivery  orders  which\t lie\naccepteddid   not  contain  the\t  restrictions\t requiring\nregistration   and  giving  of\tan  undertaking.    In\t the\nadditional written statement there is no specific  reference\nto Paragraph 14 of the plaint.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_69\">Another contract was entered into between the appellant\t and\nthe  respondent on 19th April, 1952, whereby the  respondent\nagreed to buy from the appellant and the appellant agreed to\nsell to the respondent 90,000 bags of B Twills at Rs.  155/-\nper 100 bags deliverable in June, 1952.\t The contract was in\nthe  Standard I.J.M.A. Contract Forms.\tIn Paragraph  18  of\nthe plaint it is alleged that on the due date the  plaintiff\nduly  tendered the pucca Delivery Orders in respect  of\t the\ngoods  deliverable in June, 1952, and the respondent  failed\nand  neglected to accept and pay for the  goods.   Regarding\nthis  contract\tthe defence in the written statement  is  in\nParagraph  6  where  it is stated  that\t &quot;the  facts  and/or\nvalidity  of  the alleged tender and/or the  alleged  resale\nand/or\tthe  alleged  notice  are  denied&quot;.   There  is\t  no\nreference  about the transactions in the additional  written\nstatement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">&#x27;raking into account the fact that the appellant as well  as\nthe respondent were engaging themselves in the Jute Trade in\nCalcutta  and were following generally the practice  of\t the\nJute   Mills  Association  and\thad  entered  into   various\ncontracts and having business relationship,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">248</span>\nthe conclusion seems to be irresistible that the  respondent\nwas familiar with the delivery order with its conditions and\naccepted  it  as  being in use in  the\tordinary  course  of\nbusiness.   It\tis  difficult to accept the  plea  that\t the\ndelivery order was not negotiable or that it was not in\t the\nterms of the contract and that it would not have enabled him\nto take possession of the goods as he had to fulfill certain\nother conditions as getting himself registered with the Mill\nand   giving  an  undertaking  as  required.\tFrom   these\ncircumstances  it  is clear that the  delivery\torders\twere\naccording  to the terms of the contract and  the  respondent\nhimself\t was  aware  of them.  The plea\t that  the  delivery\norders are not in accordance with the contract and that\t the\nconditions imposed amount to a new agreement are all belated\npleas put forward to avoid the liability.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">This aspect of the case was not brought to the notice of the\ntrial  Judge  and the appellate court.\t The  learned  trial\nJudge  held  that the appellant had not raised any  plea  of\nestoppel  and  therefore cannot rely on the failure  of\t the\nrespondent to point out the defects in the delivery\nobserved as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t       &quot;The plaintiff&#x27;s contention was that under the\n\t      contract\t the  tender  of  delivery   orders,\n\t      namely,  Mill  Pucca Delivery  Orders,  was  a\n\t      valid tender according to the contract and in,\n\t      any event was proper tender by virtue of trade\n\t      customs and understood andaccepted  Mills\n\t      pucca delivery orders as delivery ordersand\n\t      that  the defendant had accepted mill&#x27;s  pucca\n\t      delivery\t orders\t and  paid  therefore\twith\n\t      respect\tto  certain  deliveries\t under\t the\n\t      contracts in question.  It was also  contended\n\t      on behalf of the plaintiff that in some of the\n\t      correspondence  the defendant alleged that  as\n\t      the  plaintiff failed to tender  mill&#x27;s  pucca\n\t      delivery\torders, the contract  was  cancelled\n\t      and,    therefore,    there   was\t   in\t the\n\t      correspondence never any contention on  behalf\n\t      of  the defendant that mill&#x27;s  pucca  delivery\n\t      orders  were  not proper tender.\tNo  case  of\n\t      estoppel\twas pleaded and I am,  therefore  of\n\t      opinion  that the plaintiff cannot  raise\t any\n\t      such plea of estoppel.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">The question is not one of estoppel but the inference to be,\ndrawn from the conduct of the respondent.  The pleadings  as\nwell  as  the conduct lead one to the  conclusion  that\t the\ndelivery  orders were in accordance with the contract  which\nthe respondent accepted, as Mills&#x27; pucca delivery orders.\nIn  the\t result apart from the questions of law\t which\thave\nbeen  discussed in full by all the courts the  appellant  is\nentitled  to  succeed  on  the simple  ground  that  he\t has\nestablished that in the cases in dispute the delivery orders\nwere in accordance with the contracts.\tThe is allowed\twith\ncosts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">\t\t\t   ORDER\nIn  view of the majority judgment, the appeal  is  dismissed\nwith costs.
