RAMALINGESWARA RAO            \n\nWrit Petition No.24437 of 2017\n\nOrder:\n\n        This writ petition is filed challenging the communication dated\n20.07.2017 issued by the 1st respondent, Power Finance Corporation to\nthe 2nd respondent, IDBI Bank Limited.\n        The 1st petitioner is a Company incorporated under the provisions\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_1\">Companies Act, 1956</a> and is engaged in the business of\ninfrastructure and construction.  The 2nd petitioner is a subsidiary of the\nfirst petitioner Company and it was incorporated as a Special Purpose\nVehicle for setting up of a Thermal Power Project comprising four units\nnamely Unit-I (300 MW), Unit-II (300 MW), Unit-III (660 MW) and Unit-\nIV (660 MW)  in the State of Chhattisgarh.  The 1st respondent is a\nfinancial institution, a Central Government Public Sector undertaking and\nis engaged in the business of financing power projects.  It makes available\nloan facilities to the entities setting up independent power projects.\nAccording to the petitioners, it is a State under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 12</a> of the\nConstitution of India.  The 2nd respondent is a Public Sector Bank and is a\nState within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.   The\n2nd respondent issued a bank guarantee in favour of the 1st respondent on\nbehalf of the 2nd Petitioner, which is the subject matter of the present\nWrit Petition.\n        The 2nd petitioner availed loan facilities from a Consortium of banks\nand financial institutions with the 1st respondent as a lead member of the\nConsortium for setting up its 300 MW Thermal Power Station (Unit-I).\nThe 2nd petitioner executed financing documents with the 1st respondent\nand other members of Consortium for availing such loan facility.  The 2nd\npetitioner availed a loan of Rs.904.34 crores by signing the Common\nSenior Debt Agreement (Facility Agreement) dated 04.08.2005 for Rupee \nTerm Loan with the 1st respondent and other members of the Consortium. \nThe said amount is required to be repaid by the 2nd petitioner in 48\nquarterly instalments which was subsequently revised to 55 quarterly\ninstalments commencing from a date indicated in the facility agreement\nafter commencement of commercial operation of the unit.  The date fixed\nwas 15.07.2010.  The commercial operation was achieved on 09.04.2010.  \nThe second petitioner also executed another agreement on 04.08.2005 \ncalled as Trust and Retention Account Agreement (TRAA).  Under the\nsaid agreement, certain accounts were opened and operated by the \nAccount Bank mentioned therein for the purpose of making available the\nrequisite funds under the Facility Agreement to the 2nd petitioner and for\nrepayment of instalments of the loan to the 1st respondent and other\nConsortium members.  The TRAA provides for maintenance of Debt   \nService Reserve Account (DSRA) to secure the above payments.  The  \naccount is required to be maintained with an amount stipulated under\nTRAA which is called as Debt Service Reserve Amount.   In order to\nprovide and maintain the DSRA under the Facility Agreement and TRAA, a  \nbank guarantee for an amount of Rs.88,56,00,000/- was furnished by the\n2nd respondent on 18.11.2011.  The said bank guarantee is valid and\nsubsisting till 16.11.2017.  The bank guarantees to an extent of 193.51\ncrores for the purpose of covering the DSRA towards debt servicing for\nthe entire debt of Units I and II by Lenders Consortium were furnished by\nthe 1st petitioner, on behalf of the 2nd petitioner, by earmarking its non-\nfund based limits maintained and made available by the 2nd respondent to\nthe 1st petitioner.  The 1st respondent also provided finance to the 2nd\npetitioner for its Unit-II for which a separate agreement was executed.\nThe total bank guarantees to an extent of 193.51 Crores includes the\nguarantee for Unit-II also.  Unit-II also became operational with effect\nfrom 07.05.2011, but it was shut down from March 2013 to December  \n2015 due to reasons beyond the control of the 2nd petitioner because of\nnon-availability of linkage coal and unviable tariff being paid by the\nconsumer Discoms resulting in financial stress to the 2nd petitioner.\nHowever, the 2nd petitioner continued to service the dues of all the\nlenders in Units I and II out of the available cash flows of Unit I.  There\nwere certain delays in paying the instalments by the 2nd petitioner to the\n1st respondent and other Consortium lenders for Unit-II loan.  Wherever\nthere was delay, the 2nd petitioner was paying the loan amounts and\ninterest along with the applicable liquidated damages and the account\nnever become a Non-performing Asset (NPA).  \n        While so, the 1st respondent under an apprehension that the\naccount would become Non-performing Asset (NPA) addressed a letter to  \nthe 2nd respondent on 18.05.2017 indicating the outstanding amount\nwith respect to Units I and II stating that an amount of Rs.88.02 Crores\nwas outstanding and shall be cleared within three months from the due\ndate indicated therein in order to avoid classifying it as NPA.  The 2nd\npetitioner paid an amount of Rs.3.5 Crores to the 1st respondent on\n30.06.2017.  In spite of the same, when a communication was issued by \nthe 1st respondent on 20.07.2017 addressed to the 2nd respondent, the\npresent Writ Petition is filed.\n        This Court, by order dated 24.07.2017 while issuing notice before\nadmission, granted interim stay for a period of one week and the same\nwas extended till 07.08.2017 by an order dated 01.08.2017.\n        Heard learned Senior Counsel, Sri D. Prakash Reddy for the\npetitioners and learned Senior Counsel, Sri A. Sudershan Reddy for the\nfirst respondent.  None appeared for the second respondent.\n        Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submits that the bank\nguarantee furnished relates to Unit I and in the absence of any\noutstanding amount relating to Unit I the invocation of bank guarantee\nfurnished for Unit I cannot be invoked for the alleged outstanding amount\nin respect of Unit II.  He further submitted that no amount was indicated\nin the letter of revocation and it is contrary to the clauses in the Bank\nguarantee. He relied on the decisions reported in Ansal Properties and\nIndustries (P) Ltd., v. Engineering Projects (India) Limited ,\nHindustan Construction Company Limited v. State of Bihar ,\nBasic Tele Services Limited v. Union of India (UOI)  and Gangotri\nEnterprises Limited v. Union of India .\n\n        Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent, on the\nother hand, submits that the accounts of Units I and II were merged as\nper the request made by the petitioners and the bank guarantee would\nenure to the benefit of said combined account and in those circumstances\nthe invocation of bank guarantee cannot be termed as illegal.  He further\nsubmits that the present Writ Petition is not maintainable in the matter\nrelating to invocation of bank guarantee pursuant to a private contract\neven though the 1st respondent is a Central Government undertaking and\nthe 2nd respondent is a Bank.  He further submitted that in view of the\nlanguage employed in the bank guarantee, there cannot be any \nadjudication in the facts of the case and the 2nd respondent is under an\nobligation to honour the letter of the 1st respondent and release the\namount.  He further submitted that the 2nd respondent is not before this\nCourt and the petitioners cannot challenge the invocation of bank\nguarantee.  He relied on the decisions reported in Joshi Technologies\nInternational INC v. Union of India  and Gujarat Maritime Board\nv. Larsen and Toubro Infrastructure Development Projects\nLimited .\n\n        In the light of the above submissions, the following points have to\nbe decided in the present Writ Petition:\n1.      Whether the Writ Petition is maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution of India in the facts and circumstances of the\ncase.\n2.      If so, whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the\ninvocation of bank guarantee is valid in law.\n\n      In view of the undisputed facts available from the record filed by\nthe petitioners and in view of the non-availability of time, the first\nrespondent did not file any counter, but produced before this Court three\nletters dated 24.04.2014, 24.07.2017 and 31.07.2017 issued by the 2nd\npetitioner to the 1st respondent and the 2nd respondent to the 1st\nrespondent and the reply given by the 1st respondent to the 2nd\nrespondent respectively.\n\n      The letter dated 22.11.2011 issued by the second respondent\nenclosing the bank guarantees reads as follows:\n       In terms of the Clause 6.1.27 of Common Senior Rupee Debt\nA Agreement and Common Senior Rupee Debt B Agreement read with    \ndefinitions Clause 1.1 of Trust and Retention Account Agreement dated\nAugust 04, 2005 of Unit-I of Lanco Amarkantak Power Limited, the\nBorrower is required to maintain an amount equivalent to two quarters\ninterest and principal payment obligations to Senior Rupee Debt A and\nDebt B Lenders in the name of Debt Service Reserve Account\n(DSRA). \n\n       In lieu of maintaining DSRA as stated above, we are pleased to\nsubmit Bank Guarantee in favour of Power Finance Corporation\n(Security Agent and Lead) for an amount of Rs.90.31 Crores the details\nof wich are furnished hereunder.\n\n\n\nBG No. \nDated \nAmount  \n(Rs.

In consideration of the requirement of maintaining\nsecurity deposit under the terms and conditions of TRA\nAgreement dated 04.08.2005 and the Facility Agreement dated  \n04.08.2005 (hereinafter called the Financing Agreements)\nsigned between Power Finance Corporation, New Delhi  \n(hereinafter called the Beneficiary) and M/s. Lanco Power\nLimited, having its registered office at Lanco House, Plot No.4,\nSoftweare Units Layout, Hitec City, Madhapur, Hyderabad  500 \n081 (hereinafter called the Borrower), for the due fulfillment by\nthe Borrower of the terms and conditions contained in the\nFinancing Agreements, of production of a bank guarantee for\nRs.88,56,00,000/- (Rupees Eighty Eight Crore Fifty Six Lacs\nonly), We, IDBI Bank Ltd., a company constituted under the\n<a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_5\">Companies Act</a> 1956 and deemed to be a banking company     \nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1129081/\" id=\"a_6\">Banking Regulation Act, 1949</a>, having its registered\nOffice and Head office at IDBI Tower, 10th FLR, TRADE\nFINANCE DEPT, WTC Complex, Cuffe Parade, Mumbai 400 005,       \nand among other places a branch at D.No.5-9-89/1, CHAPEL   \nROAD, P.B. NO.370, HYDERABAD MAIN BRANCH 500 001           \n(hereinafter referred to as the Bank which expression shall\nunless repugnant to context or meaning thereof, include its\nsuccessors or assigns in business), at the request of the\nBorrower do hereby undertake to pay to the Power Finance \nCorporation an amount not exceeding Rs.88,56,00,000/- \n(Rupees Eighty Eight Crore Fifty Six Lacs only), against any loss\nor damage caused to or suffered or would be caused to or\nsuffered by Power Finance Corporation by reason of any breach\nby the Borrower of any of the terms or conditions contained in\nthe said Agreement. \n\n2.      We, IDBI Bank Ltd., do hereby undertake to pay the\namounts due and payable under this guarantee without any \ndemur, merely on receipt of a written demand from the Power\nFinance Corporation Limited stating that the amount claimed is\ndue by way of loss or damage caused to or would be caused to \nor suffered by the Power Finance Corporation Limited by reason\nof breach by the Borrower of any of the terms or conditions\ncontained in the Financing Agreements or by reason of the\nBorrowers failure to perform any of the provisions the\nFinancing Agreements.  Any such demand made on the bank    \nshall be conclusive as regards the amount due and payable by\nthe Bank under this guarantee.  However, our liability under this\nguarantee shall be restricted to an amount not exceeding\nRs.88,56,00,000/- (Rupees Eighty Eight Crores Fifty Six Lacs\nonly).\n\n3.              We, IDBI Bank Ltd., hereby undertake to pay to the\nPower Finance Corporation Limited any money so demanded    \nbut not exceeding Rs.88,56,00,000/- (Rupees Eighty Eight\nCrores Fifty Six Lacs only), notwithstanding any dispute or\ndisputes raised by the Borrower in any suit or proceeding\npending before any Court or Tribunal relating thereto our\nliability under this present being absolute and unequivocal.\n\nThe Payment so made by us under this bank guarantee shall be  \na valid discharge of our liability for payment there under and\nthe borrower(s) shall have no claim against us for making such\npayment. \n\n\n        It appears that a similar bank guarantee was furnished by the State\nBank of Patiala for an amount of Rs.1.75 Crores and on issuing a letter of\ninvocation to the 1st respondent the State Bank honoured the same by\nremitting the amount covered by the said bank guarantee.\n\n        It appears that the 2nd petitioner addressed a letter to the 1st\nrespondent on 24.04.2014 and the relevant portion of the said letter\nreads as follows:\n     6Due to stoppage of generation in Unit-II, there\nhas been a severe cash flow constraint.  Unit-IIs Fixed\noverheads and interest are presently being met out of\nUnit-I cash flows.  However, in view of cash flow\nmismatch, we propose to make you a request for \nrestructuring Unit-I and Unit-II debt together with a\nrepayment period of 15 years with a moratorium of 18\nmonths for making repayment of installments of Unit-I\nand Unit-II on structured basis.  As EBIDTA from Unit-I\nwould be sufficient to meet the interest commitments of\nUnit-I and Unit-II, the above restructuring arrangement\nwould ensure regular interest payment to all the Lenders\nkeeping the accounts status as Standard.  We enclose\nherewith statements showing the outstanding details of\nTerm Loans of Consortium of unit-I and Unit-II together\nwith details of interest and installment overdues as on\nMarch 31,2014. \n        \n     We request you to kindly consider our submissions\nmade above and initiate the restructuring process at the\nearliest to ensure timely servicing of interest and\ninstallment to all the Consortium Members to ensure\nStandard status of the Term Loan accounts.\n\nIt appears that pursuant to such request, the term loans of Unit-I and\nUnit-II were treated as one. The letter issued by the 1st respondent to the\n2nd petitioner on 18.05.2017 reads as follows:\n      This is in reference to the overdue amount towards RTL and\nSTL dues to PFC.  It has been observed from the records that the\namount is still outstanding and has not been received.  The details\nare given below.\n\nUnit-1&amp;2\n                           (Rs.in Crores)\nDue Date \nPrincipal\nInterest\nTotal Amount \n15.02.2017  STL \n14.93\n1.47\n16.40\n15.03.2017  STL \n15.13\n1.42\n16.55\n13.04.2017 (STL) \n15.32\n1.23\n16.55\n13.04.2017 (RTL) \n9.06\n12.91\n21.97\n15.05.2017 (STL) \n15.52\n1.03\n16.55\nTotal\n69.96\n18.06\n88.02\n\nIt is important to mention here that in terms of loan\nAgreement/policy of the corporation, the non-payment of amount\non or before the due date will result in additional financial burden\non account of delayed payment charges like interest on interest\nand penal interest.\n\n      Further, RBI has directed PFC to reduce the period fro\nclassifying a loan account as NPA on account of non-payment of\ndues by the borrower from existing 6 months to 3 months.\nTherefore, for the FY 2017-18, your loan account with us will be\nclassified as NPA, if the overdues are older by 3 months as on 31st\nMarch, 2018. \n\n      It is therefore requested to give utmost priority to the\nmatter and arrange to remit the outstanding dues of Rs.88.02 core\nalong with interest for the delayed period.\n\n        As stated above, the affidavit filed in support of the petition\ndiscloses the payment of Rs.3.5 Crores on 30.06.2017 pursuant to the\nabove letter.\n        It appears that on the date of passing interim order by this Court,\ni.e.24.7.2017, the 2nd respondent addressed a letter to the 1st respondent\npursuant to the letter of invocation issued by the 1st respondent on\n20.07.2017 invoking the bank guarantee, seeking withdrawal of the same\nby stating as follows:\n        2.     As you may be aware, this guarantee was issued by  \nthe bank in good faith that Unit-I was operating profitably\nand was regular in meeting its interest and repayment\nobligations; however, after tariff disputes broke out with\nHaryana Discoms, the operations of Amarkantak Project Unit- \n2 got affected in March 2013.  Since then, company has been\nfacing liquidity issues, as interest and principal repayment\nobligations of both the units were being serviced out of cash\nflows generated by Unit-1 above.  We believe that had Unit-1\ncash flows been utilized for servicing of interest and principal\ndues of Unit-1 only, there would not have been any delay in\nservicing the dues of Unit-1 lenders.  But, PFC is lead\ninstitution of both the units and has been allowing payment\nof Unit-2 dues out of Unit-1 cash flows, which is the main\nreason for delay in servicing of interest/principal dues of Unit-\n1, for which the above BG was issued.\n        \n3.      The BG has been issued in favour of PFC in its\ncapacity as a Trustee for the Term Lenders of Unit-1, IDBI\nBank is also a working capital bank and term lender to Lanco\nAmarkantak Power Ltd.  At the JLF meeting held July 18,\n2017, the secured lenders of the project viz Allahabad Bank,\nCanara Bank, UCO Bank, Indian Bank, Syndicate Bank,   \nHUDCO, SIDBI, etc. observed that the operations of the Unit-\n1 and Unit-2 were financially viable and the problem being\nfaced by LAPL was only due to the delay in completion of the\nexpansion project.  Even at this meeting, the need for\ninvocation of DSRA BG was neither mentioned nro discussed.  \nStill, PFC decided to invoke the DSRA BG, though the delay in\nservicing of Unit-1 debt has always been on account of\nunprofitable operations of Unit-2 only and not on account of\nany shortfall in unit-1 cashflow.  As per the figures available\nwith us, Unit-1s DSCR for FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17 were \n1.37 and 1.19 respectively, which clearly establishes the\nfinancial viability of Unit-1 operations.  In this background,\nwe do not see any reason for PFC to invoke IDBI Banks\nDSRA BG and this action of PFC is not in accordance with the\nspirit of the consortium.\n\nThe first respondent replied on 31.07.2017 stating as follows:\n        \nWe are in receipt of IDBI Banks letter mentioned at ref.\nabove regarding invocation of the BG.  In this regard it is\ninformed as under:-\n\n1. We may reiterate that the captioned Bank Guarantee has \nbeen issued in favour of PFC duly extended from time to time.\nAs per the established principles of law and BG, all the pre-\nrequisite conditions stipulated in the notwithstanding clause\nhave been duly complied by PFC, prior to invocation of the\nBG. \n\nFurther as per clause 2 of the BG: IDBI Bank has undertaken\nto pay the amount due and payable under this guarantee\nwithout any demur, merely on receipt of a written demand\nfrom the Power Finance Corporation Ltd., stating that the\namount claimed is due by way of loss or damage caused to or \nwould be caused to or suffered by the Power Finance\nCorporation Ltd. By reasons of breach by the Borrower of any\nof the terms and conditions contained in the Financing\nAgreements or by reasons of the Borrowers failure to\nperform any of the provisions the Financing Agreement.\n\nHence, IDBI being the BG Banker was required to process the \ninvocation without any demur and delay as non-payment to \nthe beneficiary of the BG shall tantamount to breach of the\nterms and conditions of the guarantee in question, under the\n<a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_7\">Indian Contract Act</a>.\n\n2.      All the issues raised pertaining to the project in the\naforementioned letter of IDBI are irrelevant as far as\ninvocation of BG is concerned and is out of the periphery of\ncontractual terms of the BG.\n\n3.      As you are aware, at the request of the Borrower, all\nthe consortium lenders have accorded sanction to realign and\ncombine the trust and retention accounts pertaining to\nProject Unit 1 and 2 and reschedule the repayments due to\nthe project lenders in order to enable the borrower to meet\nits debt servicing and other payment obligations.  Hence, the\nTrust and Retention Account (TRA) of Units-1 and 2 have\nbeen merged.  Consequently, BG issued by IDBI Bank in  \nfavour of PFC, is available in lieu of Debt Servicing and\nReverse Account (DSRA) requirement of both Units-1 and 2. \n\n4.      We may further inform you that as on the date of BG\ninvocation, the project term lenders outstanding dues have\nbeen accruing since May 2017 onwards to the extent of\nRs.140 Crores (approx.).  Further the dues are being cleared\npartly only by LAPL, which is resulting in the levy of\nadditional interest/penal interest on the outstanding dues.\nNon-payment of scheduled outstanding dues is breach by the \nBorrower of the terms and conditions contained in the\nFinancing Agreement caused loss to the Project lenders,\ntherefore it was decided to invoke the said BG for clearing\nthe dues of the Project lenders.\n\n5.      You may also appreciate that LAPL has also submitted \na BG of Rs.1.75 Crore from State Bank of Patiala in lieu of\nDSRA of Unit 1 And 2.  The same has also been invoked by  \nPFC and the proceeds have been promptly remitted as per \ninstructions.\n\nTo conclude, we may state that the said bank guarantee is a\ncontract between the beneficiary and the bank.  Upon\ninvocation of the said BG by the beneficiary by serving the\nletter of invocation, it is obligatory on the Banks part to\nmake payment to the Beneficiary.  Delay in honouring the\nguarantee tends to erode its value, the sanctity of scheme of\nguarantees and image of the Bank and loss to the beneficiary.\nWe hope this above clarifies the matter and request the IDBI\nBank for further appropriate action in the matter.\n\n\n        The above facts, being supported by documentary evidence, cannot \nbe disputed.  But the learned Senior Counsel for the Petitioners submitted\nthat the above correspondence is subsequent to the invocation of bank\nguarantee. It is also not disputed since the correspondence refers to the\nletter of invocation.\n\n        In the light of the above facts, the points framed above have to be\ndecided.\n\nPOINT NO.1 (MAINTAINABILITY OF THE WRIT PETITION):       \n        The authoritative decision of the Supreme Court with regard to\nmaintainability of a Writ Petition in a matter like this is Joshi\nTechnologies International INCs case (supra).  In the said case the\nfacts set out in the judgment of the Honble Supreme Court are as follows:\n        It so happened that the appellant had entered    \ninto two contracts dated 20.02.1995 with the Union of India,\nthrough Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) in \nthe year 1992 relating to exploration of certain oil fields\nwhich the Union of India had selected in Gujarat and other\nStates. These contracts were on production sharing basis for\nDholka and Wavel Oil Fields respectively.  It started the\nproduction after entering into the contract and filed its\nincome tax return on the income generated from the\naforesaid production. In the returns, the appellant claimed\nbenefit of <a href=\"/doc/1627329/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 42</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961\n(hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;Act&#x27;). <a href=\"/doc/851364/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 42</a> is a special\nprovision for deductions in the case of business for\nprospecting, etc. for mineral oil. It provides for certain\nadditional allowances as are specified in the agreement,\ndetails thereof would be taken note of hereinafter. We may,\nhowever, point out here itself that such allowances, as\nstipulated in the Section, are to be specifically mentioned in\nthe agreement as well, which is entered into with the Central\nGovernment and it is also necessary that such an agreement \nhas been laid on the Table of each House of Parliament.\n2.      The Income Tax Authorities extended the benefit of\ngranting deductions under the aforesaid provisions from the\nyear 2001-02 (assessment years onwards) when the appellant  \ncommenced commercial production in the aforesaid two oil \nfields. However, while making assessment for the Assessment \nYear 2005-06, the Assessing Officer observed that there were\nno such provisions made in the Agreements which were  \nsigned between the Central Government and the appellant \nand in the absence of such stipulation in the agreement, the\nappellant was not entitled to the benefit of deductions under\n<a href=\"/doc/851364/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 42</a> of the Act. Realising that the Agreements did not\ncontain such a provision, the appellant wrote to the MoPNG\nstating that though there was such an arrangement agreed to\nas per the understanding between the two parties, non-\ninclusion thereof was an inadvertent omission in the\nContracts that were signed.  The MoPNG wrote to Ministry of\nFinance (MoF) accepting the aforesaid omissions and \nrequested the MoF to give clarification in this behalf. As no\nclarification came from the MoF, the Assessing Officer\ndisallowed the claim for deduction under <a href=\"/doc/1008536/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 42(1)(b)</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1008536/\" id=\"a_12\">42(1)(c)</a> of the Act.\n3.      At this stage, the appellant preferred writ\npetition   \nThe Writ Petition was dismissed by the High Court on 28.05.2012 and\nchallenging which the above appeal was filed.  The Honble Supreme Court\nframed five issues and  while answering Issue Nos.4 and 5 the Honble\nSupreme Court considered the following three facets included in the said\nquestions.\n        49. These issues have three facets, namely:\n\n(i)     Whether there is a prayer to this effect in the Writ\nPetition?\n(ii)    If it was intended to give such a benefit before\nentering into the agreement, whether this intention\ngives any right to the appellant to seek an\namendment?   \n(iii)   Whether the Court has the power to issue mandamus   \nor direction to the Government?\n\nWhile holding that without there being a prayer in view of availability of\nspecific averments in the body of the writ petition as well as in the\ngrounds, the plea was entertained, though reluctantly.  With regard to\nCourts power to issue Mandamus or direction, the observations of the\nCourt are as follows:\n55. Law in this aspect has developed through catena of\njudgments of this Court and from the reading of these\njudgments it would follow that in pure contractual matters\nextraordinary remedy of Writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 226</a> or <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 32</a>\nof the Constitution cannot be invoked. However, in a limited\nsphere such remedies are available only when the non-\nGovernment contracting party is able to demonstrate that its\na public law remedy which such party seeks to invoke, in\ncontradistinction to the private law remedy simplicitor under\nthe contract. Some of the case law to bring home this\ncardinal principle is taken note of hereinafter.\n\n56. Significantly, in Andi Mukta Sadguru Shree Muktajee\nVandas Swami Suvarna Jayanti Mahotsav Smarak    \nTrust &amp; Ors. v. R. Rudani ((1989) 2 SCC 691) as well,\nthis Court made it clear that if the rights are purely of private\ncharacter, no mandamus can be issued. Thus, even if the\nrespondent is a &#x27;State&#x27;, the other condition which has to be\nsatisfied for issuance of a Writ of Mandamus is the public\nduty.  In a matter of private character or purely contractual\nfield, no such public duty element is involved and, thus,\nMandamus will not lie.\n\n57. First case which needs to be referred is Bareilly\nDevelopment Authority Vs. Ajai Pal Singh and others\n[1989] 1 SCR 743).  That was the case where Appellate \nAuthority had undertaken construction of dwelling units for\npeople belonging to different income groups and the cost at\nwhich such flats were to be allotted to the allottees.\nHowever, it was mentioned that the cost stated was only\nestimated cost and subject to increase or decrease according\nto rise or fall in the price at the time of completion of\nproperty. The authority increased the cost and monthly\ninstallment rates which it demanded from the allottees were\nalmost doubled and cost and rates of installments initially\nstated in the brochure. Respondents/allottees filed writ\npetition challenging the same and in this context question of\nmaintainability of the writ petition arose. High Court, relying\nupon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nRamana Dayaram Shetty Vs. Airport Authority of \nIndia (1979) II LLJ 217 SC) allowed the writ petition by\nobserving as under : (Ajai Pal Singh v. Bareilly\nDevelopment Authority, 1986 SCC OnLine All 110 : \nAIR 1986 All 362, para 16)\n\n      &quot;16.It has not been disputed that the\ncontesting opposite party is included within the term\n`other authority&#x27; mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 12</a> of the\nconstitution. Therefore, the contesting opposite\nparties cannot be permitted to act arbitrarily with the\nprinciple which meets the test of reason and relevance.\nWhere an authority appears acting unreasonably, this\ncourt is not powerless and a writ of mandamus can be\nissued for performing its duty free from arbitrariness or\nunreasonableness. \n\n58.  In appeal filed by the Authority, this Court in Ajai Pal\nSingh case (supra), on facts, noted that the respondents had\napplied for registration only by acceptance of terms and\nconditions contained in the brochure. Moreover, subsequently\nletter was written by the Authority about the enhancement of\nthe cost of the houses/flats as well as increase in monthly\ninstallments. Rate of yearly interest requesting allottees to\ngive their written acceptance and the respondents except\nrespondent No.4 had sent their written acceptance and it was\non the basis of the written acceptance that name of first\nrespondent was included in the draw and he was successful in\ngetting allotment of a particular house. The court observed\nthat respondents were under no obligation to seek allotment\nof house/ flats even if they had registered themselves.\nNotwithstanding, they voluntarily registered themselves as\napplicants only after fully understanding the terms and\nconditions of the brochure including relating to variance in\nprices.\n\n59.     On the basis of these facts, this Court observed that\nthe aforesaid observations of the High Court relying upon\nRamana Dayaram Shetty case (supra) were not correct.  \nThus observed the Court, speaking through Ratnavel Pandian.\nJ.: (Bareilly Development Authority v. Ajai Pal Singh,\n(1989) 2 SCC 116 : (1989) 1 SCR 743, SCC pp. 125-26,  \nparas 21-22)\n\n      21. This finding in our view, is not correct in\nthe light of the facts and circumstances of this case\nbecause in Ramana Dayaram Shetty case (supra),   \nthere was no concluded contract as in this case. Even\nconceding that the BDA has the trappings of a state or\nwould be comprehended in &#x27;other authority&#x27; for the\npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 12</a> of the constitution, while\ndetermining price of the houses/flats constructed by it\nand the rate of monthly installments to be paid, the\nAuthority or its agent after entering into the field of\nordinary contract acts purely in its executive capacity.\nThereafter the relations are no longer governed by the\nconstitutional provisions but by the legally valid\ncontract which determines the rights and obligations\nof the parties inter se. In this sphere they can only\nclaim rights conferred upon them by the contract in\nthe absence of any statutory obligations on the part of\nthe authority (i.e. BDA in this case) in the said\ncontractual field.\n\n      22.  There is a line of decisions where the\ncontract entered into between the state and the\npersons aggrieved is non-statutory and purely\ncontractual and the rights are governed only by the\nterms of the contract, no writ or order can be issued\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India so as to\ncompel the authorities to remedy a breach of contract\npure and simple - Radhakrishna Agarwal Vs. State \nof Bihar (1977) 3 SCC 457), Premji Bhai Parmar\nVs. Delhi Development Authority (1980 (2) SCC \n129) and DFO Vs. Biswanath Tea Company Ltd.    \n(1981) 3 SCC 238)&quot; \n\n60. The next case of relevance is the Divisional Forest\nofficer Vs. Bishwanath Tea Co. Ltd. (supra).  In that case\nrespondents took on lease certain land from the Government.\nInitially, period of lease was 15 years. The lease was to be\nextended for cultivation and raising tea garden and was\nsubject to condition set out in the Lease Agreement and\ngenerally to Assam Land &amp; Revenue Regulation and Rules  \nmade thereunder. The Respondent Company approached     \nappellant seeking permission to cut 7000 cubic ft of timber.\nThe Appellant took the stand that as the timber was required\nfor a particular use which was not within the Grant, full\nroyalty will be payable on timber so cut and removed. The\nRespondent company paid the amount of royalty under  \nprotest and filed writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution in the High Court alleging that upon a true\nconstruction of the relevant clauses of the Grant as also the\nproviso to Rule 37 of the Settlement Rules, it was entitled to\ncut and remove timber without payment of royalty and,\ntherefore, the recovery of royalty being unsupported by law,\nthe appellant was liable to refund the same.\n\n61. A preliminary objection was taken by the appellant to the\nmaintainability of the writ petition on the ground that claim\nof the respondent flows from terms of lease and such\ncontractual rights and obligations can only be enforced in a\ncivil court. This preliminary objection was overruled by the\nCourt which proceeded to hear the matter and allowed the\nwrit petition of the respondent company. In appeal by the\nappellant to this Court, the decision of the High Court was\nreversed holding that writ was not maintainable.  The\nfollowing observations may usefully be quoted: (Bishwanath\nTea Co.Ltd. case (supra), SCC p.246, paras 8-9)\n\n      &quot;8. It is undoubtedly true that High Court can\nentertain in its extraordinary jurisdiction a petition to\nissue any of the prerogative writs for any other\npurpose. But such writ can be issued where there is\nexecutive action unsupported by law or even in respect\nof corporation there is a denial of equality before law\nor equal protection of law. The Corporation can also\nfile a writ petition for enforcement of a right under a\nstatute. As pointed out earlier, the respondent\ncompany was merely trying to enforce a contractual\nobligation. To clear the ground let it be stated that\nobligation to pay royalty for timber cut and felled and\nremoved is prescribed by the relevant regulations, the\nvalidity of regulations is not challenged. Therefore, the\ndemand for royalty is unsupported by law. What the\nrespondent claims is an exception that in view of a\ncertain term in the indenture of lease, to writ, Clause\n2, the appellant is not entitled to demand and collect\nroyalty from the respondent. This is nothing but\nenforcement of a term of a contract of lease. Hence,\nthe question whether such contractual obligation can\nbe enforced by the High Court in its writ jurisdiction.\n\n     9. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is\ncomplained of, a party complaining of such breach may\nsue for specific performance of the contract, if contract\nis capable of being specifically performed, or the party\nmay sue for damages. Such a suit would ordinarily be\ncognizable by the Civil Court. The High Court in its\nextraordinary jurisdiction would entertain a petition\neither for specific performance of contract or for\nrecovering damages. A right to relief flowing from a\ncontract has to be claimed in a Civil Court where a suit\nfor specific performance of contract or for damages\ncould be filed.....\n\nThereafter, the Court considered Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of UP\nand the observations made therein elaborately.  The further observations\nof the Court are as follows.\n65. Similarly, in State of Gujarat v. M.P. Shah Charitable\nTrust [1994) 3 SCC 552), this Court reiterated the\nprinciples that if the matter is governed by a contract, the writ\npetition is not maintainable since it is a public law remedy and\nis not available in private law field, for example, where the\nmatter is governed by a non-statutory contract.\n66. At this stage, we would like to discuss at length the\njudgment of this Court in ABL International Ltd. V Export\nCredit Guarantee Corpn. of India Ltd (2004) 3 SCC\n553), on which strong reliance is placed by the counsel for\nboth the parties. In that case, various earlier judgments right\nfrom the year 1954 were taken note of. One such judgment \nwhich the Department in support of their case had referred to\nwas the decision of Apex Court in case LIC of India v.\nEscorts Ltd.[1986) 1 SCC 264] wherein the Court had held\nthat ordinarily in matter relating to contractual obligations,\nthe Court would not examine it unless the action has some\npublic law character attached to it. The following passage from\nthe said judgment was relied upon by the respondents: (ABL\nInternational Ltd. case (supra), SCC pp. 565-66, para 12)\n&quot;12. 102..If the action of the State is related to\ncontractual obligations or obligations arising out of the\ntort, the court may not ordinarily examine it unless the\naction has some public law character attached to it.\nBroadly speaking, the court will examine actions of\nState if they pertain to the public law domain and\nrefrain from examining them if they pertain to the\nprivate law field. The difficulty will lie in demarcating\nthe frontier between the public law domain and the\nprivate law field. It is impossible to draw the line with\nprecision and we do not want to attempt it. The\nquestion must be decided in each case with reference to\nthe particular action, the activity in which the State or\nthe instrumentality of the State is engaged when\nperforming the action, the public law or private law\ncharacter of the action and a host of other relevant\ncircumstances. When the State or an instrumentality of\nthe State ventures into the corporate world and\npurchases the shares of a company, it assumes to itself\nthe ordinary role of a shareholder, and dons the robes\nof a shareholder, with all the rights available to such a\nshareholder. There is no reason why the State as a\nshareholder should be expected to state its reasons\nwhen it seeks to change the management, by a  \nresolution of the company, like any other shareholder.&quot;\n(Escorts Ltd. case (supra), SCC p.344, para 102)\n(emphasis in original)\nThis Court dealt with this judgment in the following manner:\n(SCC p.566, para 13)\n       &quot;13. We do not think this Court in the above\ncase has, in any manner, departed from the view\nexpressed in the earlier judgments in the case cited\nhereinabove. This Court in LIC v. Escorts Ltd., (supra)\nproceeded on the facts of that case and held that a\nrelief by way of a writ petition may not ordinarily be an\nappropriate remedy.  This judgment does not lay down\nthat as a rule in matters of contract the court&#x27;s\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is\nousted. On the contrary, the use of the words &quot;court\nmay not ordinarily examine it unless the action has\nsome public law character attached to it&quot; itself indicates\nthat in a given case, on the existence of the required\nfactual matrix a remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution will be available.&quot;\n67. Insofar as the argument of the respondents in the said\ncase that writ petition on contractual matter was not\nmaintainable unless it is shown that the authority performs a\npublic function or discharges a public duty, is concerned, it was\nanswered in the following manner: (ABL International Ltd.\ncase (supra), SCC pp. 569-70, paras 22-23)\n&quot;22. We do not think the above judgment in VST\nIndustries Ltd. V. Workers Union (2001) 1 SCC\n298) supports the argument of the learned counsel on\nthe question of maintainability of the present writ\npetition. It is to be noted that VST Industries Ltd.,\nagainst whom the writ petition was filed was not a\nState or an instrumentality of a State as contemplated\nunder <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, hence, in the\nnormal course, no writ could have been issued against\nthe said industry. But it was the contention of the writ\npetitioner in that case that the said industry was\nobligated under the statute concerned to perform\ncertain public functions, failure to do so would give rise\nto a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226</a> against a private body.\nWhile considering such argument, this Court held that\nwhen an authority has to perform a public function or a\npublic duty if there is a failure a writ petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is maintainable. In the\ninstant case, as to the fact that the respondent is an\ninstrumentality of a State, there is no dispute but the\nquestion is: was first respondent discharging a public\nduty or a public function while repudiating the claim of\nthe appellants arising out of a contract ? Answer to this\nquestion, in our opinion, is found in the judgment of\nthis Court in the case of Shri Lekha Vidyarthi v.\nState of U.P. [1991 (1) SCC 212] wherein this Court\nheld: (SCC pp. 236-37, paras 22&amp; 24)\n      &quot;22. The impact of every State action is also\non public interest.\n                *            *                 *\n      24..It is really the nature of its personality\nas State which is significant and must characterize all its\nactions, in whatever field, and not the nature of\nfunction, contractual or otherwise which is decisive of\nthe nature of scrutiny permitted for examining the\nvalidity of its act. The requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> being\nthe duty to act fairly, justly and reasonably, there is\nnothing which militates against the concept of requiring\nthe State always to so act, even in contractual matters.&quot;\n      23. It is clear from the above observations of this\nCourt, once State or an instrumentality of State is a\nparty to the contract, it has an obligation in law to act\nfairly, justly and reasonably which is the requirement of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore, if by\nthe impugned repudiation of the claim of the appellants\nthe first respondent as an instrumentality of the State\nhas acted in contravention of the above said\nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 14</a> then we have no hesitation in\nholding that a writ court can issue suitable directions to\nset right the arbitrary actions of the first respondent.&quot;\n68.  The Court thereafter summarized the legal position in the\nfollowing manner: (ABL International Ltd., case (supra),\nSCC pp. 572, paras 27-28) \n&quot;27. From the above discussion of ours, following legal\nprinciples emerge as to the maintainability of a writ\npetition :-\n      (a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as\nagainst a State or an instrumentality of a State arising\nout of a contractual obligation is maintainable.\n      (b) Merely because some disputed questions of\nfacts arise for consideration, same cannot be a ground\nto refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as a\nmatter of rule.\n      (c) A writ petition involving a consequential\nrelief of monetary claim is also maintainable.\n      28. However, while entertaining an objection as\nto the maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_27\">Article\n226</a> of the Constitution of India, the court should bear\nin mind the fact that the power to issue prerogative\nwrits under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is plenary in\nnature and is not limited by any other provisions of the\nConstitution. The High Court having regard to the facts\nof the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to\nentertain a writ petition. The Court has imposed upon\nitself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power\n[See: Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of\nTrade Marks, Mumbai &amp; Ors. [1998 (8) SCC 1].  \nAnd this plenary right of the High Court to issue a\nprerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the\nCourt to the exclusion of other available remedies unless\nsuch action of the State or its instrumentality is\narbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the\nconstitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 14</a> or for other valid\nand legitimate reasons, for which the court thinks it\nnecessary to exercise the said jurisdiction.&quot;\n69.  The position thus summarized in the aforesaid principles\nhas to be understood in the context of discussion that\npreceded which we have pointed out above. As per this, no\ndoubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability of the\nwrit petition even in contractual matters or where there are\ndisputed questions of fact or even when monetary claim is\nraised. At the same time, discretion lies with the High Court\nwhich under certain circumstances, can refuse to exercise. It\nalso follows that under the following circumstances, &#x27;normally&#x27;,\nthe Court would not exercise such a discretion:\n69.1. The Court may not examine the issue unless the action\nhas some public law character attached to it.\n69.2. Whenever a particular mode of settlement of dispute is\nprovided in the contract, the High Court would refuse to\nexercise its discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\nand relegate the party to the said mode of settlement,\nparticularly when settlement of disputes is to be resorted to\nthrough the means of arbitration.\n69.3. If there are very serious disputed questions of fact which\nare of complex nature and require oral evidence for their\ndetermination.\n69.4. Money claims per se particularly arising out of\ncontractual obligations are normally not to be entertained\nexcept in exceptional circumstances.\n70.   Further, the legal position which emerges from various\njudgments of this Court dealing with different\nsituations/aspects relating to contracts entered into by the\nState/public authority with private parties, can be summarized\nas under:\n70.1 At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts\npurely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations\nof fairness.\n70.2 State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual\nfield, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practice some\ndiscriminations.\n70.3 Even in cases where question is of choice or consideration\nof competing claims before entering into the field of contract,\nfacts have to be investigated and found before the question of\na violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution could arise. If\nthose facts are disputed and require assessment of evidence\nthe correctness of which can only be tested satisfactorily by\ntaking detailed evidence, involving examination and cross-\nexamination of witnesses, the case could not be conveniently\nor satisfactorily decided in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution. In such cases the court can direct the\naggrieved party to resort to alternate remedy of civil suit etc.\n70.4 Writ jurisdiction of High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution was not intended to facilitate avoidance of\nobligation voluntarily incurred.\n70.5 Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid contractual\nobligation. Occurrence of commercial difficulty, inconvenience\nor hardship in performance of the conditions agreed to in the\ncontract can provide no justification in not complying with the\nterms of contract which the parties had accepted with open\neyes. It cannot ever be that a licensee can work out the license\nif he finds it profitable to do so: and he can challenge the\nconditions under which he agreed to take the license, if he\nfinds it commercially inexpedient to conduct his business.\n70.6. Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained of,\nthe party complaining of such breach may sue for specific\nperformance of the contract, if contract is capable of being\nspecifically performed. Otherwise, the party may sue for\ndamages.  \n70.7. Writ can be issued where there is executive action\nunsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation there is\ndenial of equality before law or equal protection of law or if  it\ncan be shown that action of the public authorities was without\ngiving any hearing and violation of principles of natural justice\nafter holding that action could not have been taken without\nobserving principles of natural justice.\n70.8. If the contract between private party and the\nState/instrumentality and/or agency of State is under the\nrealm of a private law and there is no element of public law,\nthe normal course for the aggrieved party, is to invoke the\nremedies provided under ordinary civil law rather than\napproaching the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India and invoking its extraordinary\njurisdiction.\n70.9. The distinction between public law and private law\nelement in the contract with State is getting blurred. However,\nit has not been totally obliterated and where the matter falls\npurely in private field of contract. This Court has maintained\nthe position that writ petition is not maintainable. The\nDichotomy between public law and private law, rights and\nremedies would depend on the factual matrix of each case and\nthe distinction between public law remedies and private law,\nfield cannot be demarcated with precision. In fact, each case\nhas to be examined, on its facts whether the contractual\nrelations between the parties bear insignia of public element.\nOnce on the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of\nthe activity or controversy involves public law element, then\nthe matter can be examined by the High Court in writ petitions\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to see whether\naction of the State and/or instrumentality or agency of the\nState is fair, just and equitable or that relevant factors are\ntaken into consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone\ninto the decision making process or that the decision is not\narbitrary.\n70.10. Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen,\nin such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable\nright, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may\nrender the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirements\nof due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of\nthe principle of non-arbitrariness.\n70.11. The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes\nfalling within the domain of contractual obligations may be\nmore limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be\nrelegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies\nprovided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes.\n71. Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles and after\nconsidering the arguments of respective parties, we are of the\nview that on the facts of the present case, it is not a fit case\nwhere the High Court should have exercised discretionary\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. First, the\nmatter is in the realm of pure contract. It is not a case where\nany statutory contract is awarded.\nThe appeal was ultimately dismissed confirming the order of the High\nCourt.  The above elaborate extracts from the judgment of the Honble\nSupreme Court are made only in order to avoid repetition of the facts\nconsidered in various cases and to put the law in proper perspective.\n        The observations made therein and law laid down were considered\nin Gujarat Maritime Boards case (supra) and approved the ratio laid\ndown in the above decision.  The brief facts in Gujarat Maritime\nBoards case are; the appellant invited bids for development of\nSutrapada Port and a letter of intent was issued to the first respondent.\nAs per the letter of intent a performance guarantee/bank guarantee of\nRs.5.00 Crores was required to be submitted to Gujarat Maritime Board.\nThe first respondent requested for change of location from Sutrapadu to\nKachchigarh and the bank guarantee was extended.  The Yes Bank Limited   \nfurnished a bank guarantee to the appellant on 26.11.2011 for the\namount of Rs.5.00 Crores.  The first respondent could not proceed with\nthe work even at the new place and the appellant by letter dated\n10.03.2015 cancelled the letter of intent issued to the first respondent\nand on the same day invoked the bank guarantee furnished by Yes Bank  \nLimited at the instance of the first respondent.  Challenging the\ncancellation of letter of intent and invocation of bank guarantee the first\nrespondent filed a writ petition before the High Court of Gujarat and the\nwrit petition was allowed.  In the back drop of the said facts of the case,\nthe Honble Supreme Court observed as follows:\n                9. Unfortunately, the High Court went wrong both in\nits analysis of facts and approach on law. A cursory reading of\nLoI would clearly show that it is not a case of forfeiture of\nsecurity deposit  if the contract had frustrated on account of\nimpossibility but invocation of the performance bank\nguarantee. On law, the High Court ought to have noticed that\nthe bank guarantee is an independent contract between the\nguarantor-bank and the guarantee-appellant. The guarantee is\nunconditional. No doubt, the performance guarantee is against\nthe breach by the lead promoter, viz., the first respondent. But\nbetween the bank and the appellant, the specific condition\nincorporated in the bank guarantee is that the decision of the\nappellant as to the breach is binding on the bank. The\njustifiability of the decision is a different matter between the\nappellant and the first respondent and it is not for the High\nCourt in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia to go into that question since several disputed questions\nof fact are involved.\nThereafter, it approved the ratio laid down in Joshi Technologies\nInternational INCs case (supra) and made the following\nobservations.\n        11. It is contended on behalf of the first\nrespondent that the invocation of Bank Guarantee\ndepends on the cancellation of the contract and once the\ncancellation of the contract is not justified, the invocation\nof Bank Guarantee also is not justified. We are afraid that\nthe contention cannot be appreciated. The bank guarantee\nis a separate contact and is not qualified by the contract\non performance of the obligations. No doubt, in terms of\nthe bank guarantee also, the invocation is only against a\nbreach of the conditions in the LoI. But between the\nappellant and the bank, it has been stipulated that the\ndecision of the appellant as to the breach shall be\nabsolute and binding on the Bank.\n      12. An injunction against the invocation of an\nabsolute and an unconditional bank guarantee cannot be\ngranted except in situations of egregious fraud or\nirretrievable injury to one of the parties concerned. This\nposition also is no more res integra. In Himadri\nChemicals Industries Limited v. Coal Tar Refining\nCompany [2007) 8 SCC 110], at paragraph -14: (SCC  \npp. 117-18)\n      14. From the discussions made hereinabove\nrelating to the principles for grant or refusal to grant\nof injunction to restrain enforcement of a bank\nguarantee or a letter of credit, we find that the\nfollowing principles should be noted in the matter of\ninjunction to restrain the encashment of a bank\nguarantee or a letter of credit:\n      (i) While dealing with an application for\ninjunction in the course of commercial dealings, and\nwhen an unconditional bank guarantee or letter of\ncredit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled\nto realise such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit\nin terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes\nrelating to the terms of the contract.\n      (ii) The bank giving such guarantee is bound to\nhonour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute\nraised by its customer.\n      (iii) The courts should be slow in granting an\norder of injunction to restrain the realisation of a\nbank guarantee or a letter of credit.\n      (iv) Since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit\nis an independent and a separate contract and is\nabsolute in nature, the existence of any dispute\nbetween the parties to the contract is not a ground\nfor issuing an order of injunction to restrain\nenforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit.\n      (v) Fraud of an egregious nature which would\nvitiate the very foundation of such a bank guarantee\nor letter of credit and the beneficiary seeks to take\nadvantage of the situation.\n      (vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional\nbank guarantee or a letter of credit would result in\nirretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties\nconcerned.\n      13. The guarantee given by the bank to the\nappellant contains only the condition that in case of\nbreach by the lead promoter, viz., the first respondent of\nthe conditions of LoI, the appellant is free to invoke the\nbank guarantee and the bank should honour it  without\nany demur, merely on a demand from GMB (appellant)  \nstating that the said lead promoter failed to perform the\ncovenants. It has also been undertaken by the bank \nthat such written demand from the appellant on the bank\nshall be  conclusive, absolute and unequivocal as\nregards the amount due and payable by the bank under \nthis guarantee. Between the appellant and the first\nrespondent, in the event of failure to perform the\nobligations under the LoI dated 06.02.2008, the appellant\nwas entitled to cancel the LoI and invoke the bank\nguarantee. On being satisfied that the first respondent has\nfailed to perform its obligations as covenanted, the\nappellant cancelled the LoI and resultantly invoked the\nbank guarantee. Whether the cancellation is legal and\nproper, and whether on such cancellation, the bank\nguarantee could have been invoked on the extreme \nsituation of the first respondent justifying its inability to\nperform its obligations under the LoI, etc., are not within\nthe purview of an inquiry under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India. Between the bank and the\nappellant, the moment there is a written demand for\ninvoking the bank guarantee pursuant to breach of the\ncovenants between the appellant and the first respondent,\nas satisfied by the appellant, the bank is bound to\nhonour the payment under the guarantee.\n       (Underlining and emphasis is mine)\n        What emerges from the above discussion is that though the\nrespondent is a State within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution\nof India, in the absence of any element of public law, the Writ Petition in\na contractual matter is not maintainable.  In respect of bank guarantees,\nthe satisfaction of the beneficiary is final with regard to breach of the\ncovenants between the beneficiary and the person on whose behalf the\nbank guarantee was issued and the bank has no other alternative except\nto honour the payment under the guarantee.\n        In the case before me, though the respondents satisfy the\nrequirement of State, no relief can be granted in the present Writ Petition\nin the absence of any element of public law.  The contract between the\npetitioners and the respondents are purely private contracts.  The first\npoint is answered accordingly.\nPOINT NO.2:   With regard to nature of the bank guarantees, the\ndecision of the Honble Supreme Court in Himadri Chemicals\nIndustries Limited v. Coal Tar Refining Company  is an authority.\n        The said case arises out of an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 9</a> of the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 seeking an order of injunction\nrestraining the respondent from receiving any payment under a letter of\ncredit.  The appellant entered into a contract with the respondent by\nwhich the respondent agreed to supply 26,000 metric tons of extra hard\npitch (reprocessing grade) (in short goods) to the appellant as per the\nschedule set out in the contract.  As per the terms of the contract an\nirrevocable letter of credit was opened in favour of the respondent.\nUnder the said letter of credit payment was to be made at sight.  When\nthe banker received a document against which payment was to be made   \nthe banker noticed that the description of goods was not in terms of the\nletter of credit and accordingly communicated the same to the appellant.\nThough correspondence ensued the issue with regard to quality of goods\nwas not settled.  In those circumstances, the application under <a href=\"/doc/1549225/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 9</a>\nof the Act was filed by the appellant to stop release of payment under the\nletter of credit without first resolving the issue regarding the quality of\ngoods.  Initially an order of status quo was passed by the learned single\nJudge of the High Court and later on it was vacated.  The said order of\nvacation was confirmed by the Division Bench.  In the back drop of above\nfacts, the Honble Supreme Court held as follows:\n10. The law relating to grant or refusal to grant injunction in\nthe matter of invocation of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of\nCredit is now well settled by a plethora of decisions not only\nof this court but also of the different High Courts in India. In\nU.P. State Sugar Corporation Vs. Sumac International\nLtd. [(1997) 1 SCC 568], this court considered its various\nearlier decisions. In this decision, the principle that has been\nlaid down clearly on the enforcement of a Bank guarantee or\na Letter of Credit is that in respect of a Bank Guarantee or a\nLetter of Credit which is sought to be encashed by a\nbeneficiary, the bank giving such a guarantee is bound to\nhonour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute raised by\nits customer. Accordingly this Court held that the courts\nshould be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain\nthe realization of such a Bank Guarantee. It has also been\nheld by this court in that decision that the existence of any\ndispute between the parties to the contract is not a ground\nto restrain the enforcement of Bank guarantees or Letters of\nCredit. However this court made two exceptions for grant of\nan order of injunction to restrain the enforcement of a Bank\nGuarantee or a Letter of Credit. (i) Fraud committed in the\nnotice of the bank which would vitiate the very foundation of\nguarantee; (ii) injustice of the kind which would make it\nimpossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself.\n11. Except under these circumstances, the courts should not\nreadily issue injunction to restrain the realization of a Bank\nGuarantee or a Letter of Credit. So far as the first exception\nis concerned, i.e. of fraud, one has to satisfy the court that\nthe fraud in connection with the Bank Guarantee or Letter of\nCredit would vitiate the very foundation of such a Bank\nGuarantee or Letter of Credit. So far as the second exception\nis concerned, this court has held in that decision that it\nrelates to cases where allowing encashment of an\nunconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable\nharm or injustice to one of the parties concerned. While\ndealing with the case of fraud, this court in the case of U.P.\nCoop. Federation Ltd. Vs. Singh Consultants and\nEngineers (P) Ltd. (1988) 1 SCC 174) held as follows:\n(SCC p. 197, para 53)\n\n      The fraud must be of an egregious nature such\nas to vitiate the entire underlying transaction.\n      (emphasis supplied)\nWhile coming to a conclusion as to what constitutes fraud,\nthis court in the above case quoted (at SCC p.197, para 54)\nwith approval the observations of Sir John Donaldson, M.R.\nin Bolivinter Oil SA v. Chase Manhattan Bank (1984) 1\nAll ER 351 (CA) at p. 352g-h which is as follows:\n      The wholly exceptional case where an\ninjunction may be granted is where it is proved that\nthe bank knows that any demand for payment already  \nmade or which may thereafter be made will clearly be\nfraudulent. But the evidence must be clear both as to\nthe fact of fraud and as to the banks knowledge. It\nwould certainly not normally be sufficient that this\nrests on the uncorroborated statement of the\ncustomer, for irreparable damage can be done to a\nbanks Credit in the relatively brief time which must\nelapse between the granting of such an injunction and\nan application by the bank to have it charged.\n      (Emphasis supplied)\n      12. In Svenska Handelsbanken Vs. Indian\nCharge Chrome [(1994) 1 SCC 502], it has also been \nheld that a confirmed Bank Guarantee/irrevocable Letter of\nCredit cannot be interfered with unless there is established\nfraud or irretrievable injustice involved in the case. In fact, on\nthe question of fraud, this decision approved the observations\nmade by this court in the case of U.P. Coop. Federation\nLtd Vs. Singh Consultants and Engineers (P) Ltd.\n(supra).\n      13. So far as the second exception is concerned, this\ncourt in U.P. State Sugar Corporation Vs. Sumac \nInternational Ltd. (supra) as considered herein earlier, at\npara 14 on page 575 observed as follows :\n      14. On the question of irretrievable injury\nwhich is the second exception to the rule against\ngranting of injunctions when unconditional bank\nguarantees are sought to be realized the court said in\nthe above case that the irretrievable injury must be of\nthe kind which was the subject matter of the decision\nin the Itek Corpn. V. First National Bank of\nBoston (566 Fed Supp 1210). In that case an\nexporter in USA entered into an agreement with the\nImperial government of Iran and sought an order\nterminating its liability on stand by letter of credit\nissued by an American Bank in favour of an Iranian\nBank as part of the contract. The relief was sought on\naccount of the situation created after the Iranian\nrevolution when the American Government cancelled \nthe export licences in relation to Iran and the Iranian\ngovernment had forcibly taken 52 American citizens as\nhostages. The US Government had blocked all Iranian \nassets under the jurisdiction of United States and had\ncancelled the export contract. The court upheld the\ncontention of the exporter that any claim for damages\nagainst the purchaser if decreed by the American\ncourts would not be executable in Iran under these\ncircumstances and realization of the bank\nguarantee/letters of credit would cause irreparable\nharm to the Plaintiff. This contention was upheld. To\navail of this exception, therefore, exceptional\ncircumstances which make it impossible for the\nguarantor to reimburse himself it he ultimately\nsucceeds, will have to be decisively established.\nClearly, a mere apprehension that the other party will\nnot be able to pay, is not enough. In Itek case, there\nwas certainty on this issue. Secondly, there was good\nreason, in that case for the Court to be prima facie\nsatisfied that the guarantors i.e. the bank and its\ncustomer would be found entitled to receive the\namount paid under the guarantee.\n       (Emphasis supplied)\n      14. From the discussions made hereinabove relating to\nthe principles for grant or refusal to grant of injunction to\nrestrain enforcement of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of\nCredit, we find that the following principles should be noted\nin the matter of injunction to restrain the encashment of a\nBank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit :-\n      (i) While dealing with an application for\ninjunction in the course of commercial dealings, and\nwhen an unconditional Bank Guarantee or Letter of\nCredit is given or accepted, the Beneficiary is entitled\nto realize such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit\nin terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes\nrelating to the terms of the contract.\n      (ii) The Bank giving such guarantee is bound to\nhonour it as per its terms irrespective of any dispute\nraised by its customer.\n      (iii) The Courts should be slow in granting an\norder of injunction to restrain the realization of a Bank\nGuarantee or a Letter of Credit.\n      (iv) Since a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit\nis an independent and a separate contract and is\nabsolute in nature, the existence of any dispute\nbetween the parties to the contract is not a ground for\nissuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement\nof Bank Guarantees or Letters of Credit.\n      (v) Fraud of an egregious nature which would\nvitiate the very foundation of such a Bank Guarantee or\nLetter of Credit and the beneficiary seeks to take\nadvantage of the situation.\n      (vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional\nBank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit would result in\nirretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties\nconcerned.\n      In the instant case, there is no plea of fraud or irretrievable harm\nor injustice and this court, on the basis of record available, does not find\nany such exception. In view of the same, this Court is not inclined to go\ninto the merits of the present controversy between the parties relating to\nthe original contract between the petitioners and the first respondent and\non the settled point of law, the second respondent is bound by the terms\nof the bank guarantee.  In the Hindustan Construction Co. Ltd. Case\n(supra), the bank guarantees were invoked and when invocation was\nchallenged in a suit, the courts went into the merits of the case. Similarly,\nthe case in Basic Tele Services Ltd. (supra) is also after invocation of\nbank guarantee and the court examined the merits of the case.  In\nGangotri Enterprises Limited (supra), the dispute was in relation to\nthe monies due and invocation of bank guarantee in an unrelated\ncontract between the same parties. Thus, the decisions cited by the\nlearned Counsel for the Petitioners relate to the merits of respective cases\nand are not relevant for the purpose of present case.\n      This court is of the opinion that the present Writ Petition is not\nmaintainable in this court in view of the nature of private contract without\nany element of public law and is liable to be dismissed. Accordingly the\nWrit Petition is dismissed at the admission stage. No costs.\n      As a sequel thereto, the miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending in\nthis Writ Petition shall stand closed.\n\n____________________________     \nA.RAMALINGESWARA RAO, J        \n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1\">Date: 07th August 2017\n          </p>","numcites":12,"numcitedby":1,"docsource":"Andhra HC (Pre-Telangana)","citetid":163976018,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"writ petition maintainability","formInput":"writ%20petition%20maintainability"},{"value":"invocation of bank guarantee","formInput":"invocation%20of%20bank%20guarantee"},{"value":"public law and private law","formInput":"public%20law%20and%20private%20law"},{"value":"writ petition not maintainable","formInput":"writ%20petition%20not%20maintainable"},{"value":"article 12","formInput":"article%2012"},{"value":"letter of credit","formInput":"letter%20of%20credit"},{"value":"article 226 of constitution","formInput":"article%20226%20of%20constitution"},{"value":"public function","formInput":"public%20function"},{"value":"contractual obligations","formInput":"contractual%20obligations"},{"value":"\"bank guarantee\" \"invocation\"","formInput":"%22bank%20guarantee%22%20%22invocation%22"},{"value":"public duty","formInput":"public%20duty"},{"value":"specific performance","formInput":"specific%20performance"},{"value":"\"gujarat maritime board\"","formInput":"%22gujarat%20maritime%20board%22"},{"value":"public law element","formInput":"public%20law%20element"},{"value":"bank guarantee ","formInput":"bank%20guarantee%20"},{"value":"npa","formInput":"npa"},{"value":"grant of injunction","formInput":"grant%20of%20injunction"},{"value":"\"invocation of bank guarantee\" ","formInput":"%22invocation%20of%20bank%20guarantee%22%20"},{"value":"mandamus","formInput":"mandamus"},{"value":"Instrumentality of state","formInput":"Instrumentality%20of%20state"}],"cats":[{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"definition-of-state","formInput":"tag:definition-of-state"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"},{"value":"companies-law","formInput":"tag:companies-law"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
