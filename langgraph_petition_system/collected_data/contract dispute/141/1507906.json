It was further directed that Brig. \nNardip Singh (Retd.) who was appointed by respondent no.1 shall \nproceed with the arbitration in accordance with law and give the \naward.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.\tGas Authority of India \u0016 (GAIL, appellant no.1 herein) awarded \nfour contracts for its project at Petro-Chemical Complex, Dibiyapur, \nDistrict Etawah (U.P.) to M/s Keti Construction (I) Ltd., Indore \u0016 \n(Contractor), which is arrayed as respondent no.1 in the present \nappeal.   All the four contracts were awarded in the year 1995 and \nthey related to construction of certain types of houses for GAIL Vihar \nTownship, pre-mix bitumen carpeting and repair of roads in GAIL \nVihar Colony, construction of external sewerage line and construction \nof certain residential quarters in UPPC Complex, Dibiyapur. Certain \ndisputes arose between the parties regarding completion of the \nconstruction work in accordance with the design and cost of \nconstruction, etc. The contracts entered into between the parties \ncontained arbitration clause.   Appellant no.1 referred the dispute with \nregard to contract dated 28.9.1995 for arbitration to  Justice N.N. \nGoswami (Retd.) who was formerly a Judge of Delhi High Court.  \nThe arbitrator gave a &#x27;no claim award&#x27; on 19.4.2000.  Respondent \nno.1 filed a petition under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 34</a> of the Act in the Delhi High \nCourt for setting aside the award.  A learned Single Judge who heard \nthe petition, after detailed discussion of the material on record, found \nthat the petition was devoid of merits and accordingly dismissed the \nsame by the judgment and order dated 20.10.2003.  Respondent no.1 \nthen preferred an appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court \nunder <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 37</a> of the Act which allowed the same by the judgment \nand order dated 7.12.2004 and set aside the award of the arbitrator.  It \nwas further directed in the order that parties shall appear before Brig. \nNardip Singh (Retd.) who had been nominated as arbitrator by \nrespondent no.1 (contractor) and he shall proceed in accordance with \nlaw and give the award. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.\tThe principal ground on which the petition under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 34</a> of \nthe Act had been filed by respondent no.1 was that it had invoked the \narbitration clause by sending a notice to appellant no.1 on 17.7.1999 \nand accordingly the appellant no.1 was required to send a panel of \nthree names for arbitration within 30 days of receipt of notice.   Since \nappellant no.1 did not respond to the notice and did not send a panel \nwithin 30 days, it forfeited its right to nominate a panel and thereafter \nrespondent no.1 sent its own panel on 28.10.1999.  Appellant no.1 \nagain did not make any response and did not choose anyone from the \npanel nominated by respondent no.1 and accordingly it informed \nappellant no.1 on 10.12.1999 that it had selected Brig. Nardip Singh \n(Retd.) as an arbitrator and the said arbitrator entered upon  the \nreference on 6.1.2000.  Appellant no.1 appointed Justice N.N. \nGoswami (Retd.) as an arbitrator subsequently on 13.1.2000 which \nappointment was not valid being contrary to the terms of the \nagreement entered into between the parties. Respondent no.1 thus \nsubmitted that the appointment of Justice N.N. Goswami (Retd.) was  \ninvalid and the award given by him was liable to be set aside in view \nof <a href=\"/doc/98290235/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 34(2)(v)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.\tThe petition was contested by the appellants on the grounds, \ninter alia, that appellant no.1 had already sent a panel of three names \non 16.2.1999 in which the name of Justice N.N. Goswami (Retd.) was \nmentioned at serial no.1 and it was mentioned that disputes between \nthe parties relating to all the contracts be resolved by the same \narbitrator.  In reply to the notice of respondent no.1, the appellants&#x27; \nadvocate Mr. Sushil Chauhan had sent a reply on 31.7.1999 asking to \nchoose any one from the said panel.  This was again reiterated by a \nletter dated 15.11.1999 when respondent no.1 sent its own panel on \n28.10.1999. The appointment of Brig. Nardip Singh (Retd.) as an \narbitrator made by respondent no.1 which was communicated by its \nletter of 10.12.1999 was challenged by appellant no.1 by sending a \nletter dated 31.12.1999 and a letter was also sent in this regard to Brig. \nNardip Singh (Retd.) to desist from proceeding with arbitration.   It \nwas further submitted that respondent no.1 did not challenge the \njurisdiction of the arbitrator appointed by appellant no.1 in accordance \nwith <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 16</a> of the Act.  The contractor did not at all appear before \nthe arbitrator appointed by appellant no.1, viz. Justice N.N. Goswami \n(Retd.) and did not submit any statement of claim.  In these \ncircumstances, there was no ground for setting aside the award made \nby Justice N.N. Goswami (Retd.) on 19.4.2000 and the petition under \n<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a> of the Act filed by respondent no.1 was liable to be \ndismissed.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">6.\tWe have heard Mr. Mohan Parasaran, Additional Solicitor \nGeneral for the appellant and Mr. P.C.

The Appointing Authority shall thereupon \nwithout any delay appoint the said person as the sole \narbitrator.  If the CONTRACTOR fails to communicate \nsuch selection as provided above within the period \nspecified, the Appointing Authority shall make the \nselection and appoint the selected as the Sole Arbitrator.\n\tIf the Appointing Authority fails to send to the \nCONTRACTOR the panel of three names as aforesaid \nwithin the period specified, the CONTRACTOR shall \nsend the Appointing Authority a panel of three names of \npersons who shall all be unconnected with either party.  \nThe Appointing Authority shall on receipt of the names \nas aforesaid select any one of the persons named and \nappoint him as the sole arbitrator.  If the Appointing \nAuthority fails to select the person and appoint him as the \nsole Arbitrator within 30 days of the receipt of the panel \nand inform the CONTRACTOR accordingly, the \nCONTRACTOR shall be entitled to appoint one of the \npersons from the panel as the sole arbitrator and \ncommunicate his name to the Appointing Authority.\n\tIf the Arbitrator so appointed is unable to or \nunwilling to act or resigns his appointment or vacates his \noffice due to any reason whatsoever, another sole \narbitrator shall be appointed as aforesaid.\n\tThe WORK under the CONTRACT shall, \nhowever, continue during the Arbitration proceedings \nand no payment due or payable to the CONTRACTOR \nshall be withheld on account of such proceedings.\n\tThe Arbitrator shall be deemed to have entered on \nthe reference on the date he issues notice to both the \nparties fixing the date of the first hearing.\n\tThe Arbitrator may, from time to time, with the \nconsent of the parties, enlarge the time for making and \npublishing the award.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\tThe venue of the arbitration shall be New Delhi.\n\tThe fees, if any, of the Arbitrator shall, if required \nto be paid before the award is made and published, be \npaid half AND half by each of the parties.

Thereafter, the appointing \nauthority was under an obligation to appoint the said person as sole \narbitrator. However, if the appointing authority failed to send the \npanel of three names within the stipulated period, the contractor was \ngiven the option to send a panel of three names to appellant no.1, \nwhich was required to select anyone of them and communicate the \nsaid fact within 30 days.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">9.\tThe plea taken by respondent no.1 is that the completion \ncertificate with regard to the work in dispute was  issued on 24.1.1998 \nand it wrote several times for settling the accounts. It invoked the \narbitration clause on 17.7.1999 by sending a letter to the appointing \nauthority to send a panel but as there was no response, it sent its own \npanel of three names on 28.10.1999 and finally informed vide letter \ndated 10.12.1999 that it had nominated Brig. Nardip Singh (Retd.) as \nthe arbitrator. Voluminous correspondence was exchanged between \nthe parties and many such letters were placed on record before the \nlearned Single Judge of the High Court.   It appears that some dispute \nhad been raised by respondent no.1 regarding balance work of \nconstruction of C-6 and D-2 numbers of houses at GAIL Vihar \nTownship at Dibiyapur and a letter had been sent by it to appellant \nno.1 on 16.1.1999.  A reply was given on behalf of appellant no.1 to \nrespondent no.1 on 16.2.1999, relevant part of which reads as under :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"> &quot;Sir,\n\tThis has reference to your letter vide ref. \nno.IND.KT.44(6)/99 DATED 16/1/99, we would like to \nbring to your kind notice that you have not so far \ninformed us the nature of disputes you want to refer for \nresolution by the Arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\tHowever, in the meantime, we are suggesting you \na panel of three persons to select one of them as Sole \nArbitrator :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">1.\tMr. Justice N.N.

Kukreja   &amp;    Associates\tin which the \nrepresentatives of respondent no.1 had participated.   This fact is not \nin dispute that several meetings did take place to resolve the dispute \nregarding all the four contracts between the representatives of \nappellant no.1 and respondent no.1.  The Senior Manager (Civil) of \nappellant no.1 sent a letter dated 15.11.1999 to respondent no.1 which \nhas considerable bearing on the controversy in hand and, therefore, \nthe same is being reproduced below :-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">&quot;Ref.:CE/GAIL/99\t\t\t     November 15, 1999\nM/s Keti Constructions (I) Ltd.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">31/6, Sneh Nagar, Main Road\nOpp. Sapna Sangeeta Theatre\nIndore (MP).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">SUBJECT : DISPUTES RELATING TO :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">(A)\tWORK ORDER NO.: CE/AUR/PH-II EXTN.

(A), (B), (C) \nand (D).  In this letter reference was made to the earlier letter dated \n16.2.1999 sent by appellant no.1 and the same panel of three names in \nwhich name of Justice N.N. Goswami (Retd.) was at serial no.1 was \nreiterated. The last paragraph of the above quoted letter is very \nimportant where it was clearly mentioned that the dispute arising out \nof the four contracts which cannot be mutually settled may be referred \nto a sole arbitrator selected by respondent no.1 from amongst the \npersons mentioned in the panel so that the resolution of disputes by \nreference to arbitration becomes cost effective, economical and quick.  \nTowards the end of the letter a request was made to respondent no.1 to \nselect anyone of the persons mentioned in the said letter to act as sole \narbitrator in all the above disputes, which means all the disputes \nrelating to contract nos.(A), (B), (C) and (D).  It is, therefore, clear \nthat a panel of three names had been sent by the appellant to \nrespondent no.1 on 16.2.1999 which was categorically reiterated in \nthe letter dated 15.11.1999, sent by the Senior Manager (Civil) of Gas \nAuthority of India Ltd. (appellant no.1) to respondent no.1.   This \nletter was not confined to any particular contract but specifically \nreferred to all the four contracts including the disputed contract no.(D) \ndated 28.9.1995.   The stand of appellant no.1 was quite reasonable \nthat if all the disputes were referred to a single arbitrator, the \narbitration proceedings would be cost effective, economical and \nquick.   After receipt of this letter dated 15.11.1999, wherein the \nearlier panel communicated vide letter dated 16.2.1999 had been \nreiterated, there was no occasion for respondent no.1 to appoint Brig. \nNardip Singh (Retd.) as arbitrator by sending a communication to that \neffect subsequently on 10.12.1999.   The stand of the appellant had \nbeen made very clear and explicit by the aforesaid two letters and it \nwas not required to respond again specifically to the letter dated \n28.10.1999 sent by respondent no.1 to select an arbitrator from the \npanel intimated by it.  The stand of respondent no.1 to the effect that \nas the appellant did not respond to its letter dated 28.10.1999, it \nselected Brig. Nardip Singh (Retd.) by sending a communication on \n10.12.1999 is, therefore, wholly unjustified. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">12.\tThere is contemporaneous evidence which shows that a number \nof meetings had taken place between the representatives of appellant \nno.1 and the representatives of respondent no.1, wherein effort was \nmade to resolve the disputes without reference to arbitration and an \nunderstanding had been reached between the parties that unresolved \ndisputes of all the four contracts shall be referred to a sole arbitrator to \nmake the arbitration proceedings quick and cost effective.   After \nrespondent no.1 had sent the letter dated 10.12.1999 to the appellant \nthat it had nominated Brig. Nardip Singh (Retd.) for the purpose of \narbitration, the Senior Deputy Manager (Law) of appellant no.1 sent a \nletter to him on 31.12.1999 requesting him to desist from entering \nupon the reference or taking any further steps in view of the fact that \nin the meeting held between the representatives of the two \norganisations, it was clearly agreed that the matter shall be referred to \na sole arbitrator and respondent no.1 was expected to select a name \nfrom the panel suggested by appellant no.1.  The letter is self-eloquent \nand is being reproduced below :-\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">&quot;\t\t\t\t\t      December 31, 1999\n\nBrig.

These efforts yielded \nresults and the requests for arbitration of Keti \nConstructions were withdrawn by them. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">As all these matters were between two organisations and \nit was clearly agreed by the parties to refer unresolved \ndisputes of all contracts to a sole arbitrator to make the \narbitration proceedings quick and cost effective.

The terms \nof the agreement have to be understood in a broad commonsense \nmanner. The material placed on record before the learned Single \nJudge shows that the discussion which took place in the meetings held \nbetween the representatives of appellant no.1 and representatives of \nrespondent no.1 were not confined to the  dispute relating to a single \ncontract, but they related to disputes concerning all the four contracts.   \nIt will not be proper to segregate or compartmentalize the \ncorrespondence exchanged between the parties as if a particular letter \nwas confined to a particular contract alone. The correspondence \nexchanged between the parties is not like evidence in a suit or trial \nwhere a piece of evidence given in a particular suit or trial cannot be \nread or taken into consideration in another suit or trial.   The stand of \nthe appellant right from the beginning was that all the disputes should \nbe referred to a single arbitrator, which will be cost effective, \neconomical and quick.  There can be no doubt this stand was very \nreasonable.  Appellant no.1 had sent a panel on 16.2.1999, which was \nreiterated in the communication dated 15.11.1999.  In these \ncircumstances, respondent no.1 was not at all entitled to nominate \nBrig. Nardip Singh (Retd.) as an arbitrator which it chose to do \nsubsequently on 10.12.1999.   We do not find anything wrong on the \npart of the appellant when it intimated vide letter dated 15.11.1999 \nthat a panel had already been sent earlier on 16.2.1999 for \nappointment of a single arbitrator for resolution of all the disputes \nbetween the parties. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">14.\tAccording to the appellants, after respondent no.1 had sent the \nnotice dated 17.7.1999 invoking the arbitration clause, a reply thereto \nwas given on their behalf by Mr. Sushil Chauhan, Advocate, on \n31.7.1999 wherein it was mentioned as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">&quot;Ref: Your letter IND/KT/522/99 dated 17.7.99\nPursuant to the discussions held on various occasions by \nyou and my client, GAIL officials with regard to \nsettlement of disputes and appointment of sole arbitrator, \nI am instructed by my client, Gas Authority of India Ltd. \n(GAIL) to call upon you to select the sole arbitrator from \nthe names of three distinguished persons already \nsuggested by my clients during discussions in response to \nyour notices.  Please take further necessary action.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">\tRespondent No.1 has seriously challenged the receipt of the \nletter dated 31.7.1999 sent by Mr. Sushil Chauhan. It has been urged \nthat the said letter was not sent by registered post and was not \nreceived by them. We have, therefore, not taken into consideration the \nsaid letter.  There is other material on record to show that a panel of \nthree names had already been sent by appellant no.1 to respondent \nno.1 which was a sufficient compliance of the clause of the \nagreement.  There is neither any such clause in the agreement nor \nthere is any requirement in law that for each of the contract (A), (B), \n(C) and (D) a separate panel ought to have been sent.   The same panel \ncould very well be utilized for resolving the disputes arising out of the \nfour contracts.  In fact, as suggested on behalf of the appellant, it \nwould have been more convenient, time saving and economical to \nhave the same person as arbitrator in resolving the disputes between \nthe parties with regard to all the contracts.  The view to the contrary \ntaken by the Division Bench of the High Court is clearly erroneous in \nlaw.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\">15.\tAppellant no.1 sent a communication to Justice N.N. Goswami \n(Retd.) on 13.1.2000 appointing him as sole arbitrator for resolution \nof disputes relating to the contract in question and a copy of this letter \nwas also sent to respondent no.1.   Justice N.N. Goswami (Retd.) then \nentered upon the reference and sent notices to the parties on 11.2.2000 \nto appear before him on 6.3.2000. Respondent no.1, however, chose \nnot to put in appearance before Justice N.N. Goswami (Retd.).  On \n28.3.2000, the arbitrator passed an order holding that his appointment \nas arbitrator was in accordance with the terms of the agreement, but in \nthe interest of justice he would give another notice to respondent no.1.  \nThe relevant part of the order passed by him reads as under : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">&quot;In terms of my order dated 6.3.2000, M/s Gas \nAuthority have produced the complete file.

For the \npurpose, an arbitration clause which forms part of a \ncontract shall be treated as an agreement independent of \nthe other terms of the contract. A decision by the Arbitral \nTribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail \nipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\n(2) A plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have \njurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the statement \nof defence. A party is not precluded from raising such a \nplea by the fact that he has appointed, or participated in \nthe appointment of, an arbitrator. A plea that the Arbitral \nTribunal is exceeding the scope of its authority shall be \nraised promptly after the Arbitral Tribunal has indicated \nits intention to decide on the matter alleged to be beyond \nthe scope of its authority. The Arbitral Tribunal may, in \neither case, admit a later plea if it considers the delay \njustified.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(3) The Arbitral Tribunal may rule on a plea referred to \nin paragraph (2) of this article either as a preliminary \nquestion or in an award on the merits.

Objections to the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction go to \nthe very foundation of the arbitration. Jurisdictional \nquestions are, thus, antecedent to matters of substance \nand usually ruled upon first in a separate decision, in \norder to avoid possible waste of time and costs. However, \nin some cases, in particular, where the question of \njurisdiction is intertwined with the substantive issue, it \nmay be appropriate to combine the ruling on jurisdiction \nwith partial or complete decision on the merits of the \ncase. <a href=\"/doc/386518/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 16 (3)</a>, therefore, grants the Arbitral \nTribunal discretion to rule on a plea referred to in \nparagraph (2) either as a preliminary question or in an \naward on the merits.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">\tSo, the commentary on the Model Law which was drafted by \nUNCITRAL and has been adopted by many countries including India \nshows that where a party asserts that the arbitral tribunal has not been \nproperly constituted or it has no jurisdiction, then such a plea must be \nraised before the arbitral tribunal right at the beginning and normally \nnot later than in the statement of defence.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">18.\tThe whole object and scheme of the Act is to secure an \nexpeditious resolution of disputes.   Therefore, where a party raises a \nplea that the arbitral tribunal has not been properly constituted or has \nno jurisdiction, it must do so at the threshold before the arbitral \ntribunal so that remedial measures may be immediately taken and time \nand expense involved in hearing of the matter before the arbitral \ntribunal which may ultimately be found to be either not properly \nconstituted or lacking in jurisdiction, in proceedings for setting aside \nthe award, may be avoided.  The commentary on Model Law clearly \nillustrates the aforesaid legal position.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">19.\tWhere a party has received notice and he does not raise a plea \nof lack of jurisdiction before the arbitral tribunal, he must make out a \nstrong case why he did not do so if he chooses to move a petition for \nsetting aside the award under <a href=\"/doc/98290235/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 34(2)(v)</a> of the Act on the \nground that the composition of the arbitral tribunal was not in \naccordance with the agreement of the parties.  If  plea of jurisdiction is \nnot taken before the arbitrator as provided in <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 16</a> of the Act, \nsuch a plea cannot be permitted to be raised in proceedings under \n<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 34</a> of the Act for setting aside the award, unless good reasons \nare shown.  \t\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">20.\tThough respondent no.1 had ample opportunity to appear \nbefore Justice N.N.
