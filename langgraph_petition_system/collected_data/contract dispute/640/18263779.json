It is also aggrieved by the final judgment and order dated 30\nJanuary 2023 allowing the Complaint and declaring that the Complainants are\nemployees of the Petitioner-Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation\n(PCMC). The Industrial Court has further directed the Petitioner-PCMC to\nabsorb Complainants in service from the dates of their initial joining alongwith\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">katkam                                  Page No. 46</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                  47                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\narrears of wages on par with its permanent employees doing similar work.\nAccordingly, Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003 is filed challenging the order on\npreliminary issue dated 22 November 2002 whereas Writ Petition No.1860 of\n2024 is filed challenging the final judgment and order dated 30 January 2023.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2         Narration of few basic facts leading to filing the Petitions would be\nnecessary. Petitioner is a Municipal Corporation established under the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/143854023/\" id=\"a_1\">Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949</a> <a href=\"/doc/22122408/\" id=\"a_2\">(MMC Act</a>).\nPetitioner-PCMC initiated Swachata Sankalp Mohim (cleanliness drive),\nwhich included inter alia public awareness programme to educate citizens\nabout importance of cleanliness, door to door collection of solid waste etc. It\nappears that a Resolution was adopted by the Standing Committee of\nPetitioner-PCMC on 2 September 1997 on the basis of proposal of Municipal\nCommissioner dated 26 August 1997 to engage either one or two contractors\nin each Ward without inviting tenders for collection of garbage by use of push-\ncart and accumulating the same in Municipal Waste Box. It was decided to pay\nconsolidated amount of Rs.1,800/- per month per contractor for performing\nsuch work. The Resolution contemplated either continuation of earlier\ncontractors or to engage willing persons in the Ward to be engaged as a new\ncontractor. It appears that on the basis of Resolution adopted by the Standing\nCommittee on 2 September 1997,, contracts were issued to various persons.\nOne such contract is placed on record which was issued on 3 August 1998, by\nwhich Shri. Laxman Vidurath Gaikwad was granted contract of collection of\ngarbage by use of push-cart for the period from 4 September 1998 to 31\nAugust 1998 on terms and conditions specified therein.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">katkam                                  Page No. 47</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\"> k                                  48                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n3        Mahapalika and Parivahan Kamgar Aghadi, Pimpri-Chinchwad filed\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">Complaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 before Industrial Court, Pune, on behalf of\nabout 301 such persons, who were allotted work of collection of garbage\nthrough push-carts by the Petitioner-PCMC. The Union claimed that the said\npersons were actually employees of the Petitioner-PCMC. and the entire\narrangement was nothing but a camouflage designed to avoid the\nresponsibility arising under labour legislations. The arrangement of issuing\ncontracts was thus branded as sham and a declaration was sought in the\nComplaint that 301 workers included in Annexure-P2 the Complaint be\ndeclared as direct workers of Petitioner-PCMC. Further relief for making all\nthe workers permanent from the dates of joining duties alongwith wages on\npar with permanent workers was also sought.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">4        Petitioner-PCMC appeared in the Complaint and filed its Written\nStatement. Additionally, Petitioner-PCMC also filed application for decision of\nissue of jurisdiction as preliminary issue and sought dismissal of the Complaint\non the ground that the Industrial Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain\nComplaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_3\">Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and\nPrevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971</a> <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_4\">(MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a>)\nseeking declaration that the contract is sham and bogus. The Petitioner-PCMC\ncontended that in the light of dispute about existence of employer-employee\nrelationship, Complaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_5\">MRTU and PULP Act</a> fell outside\njurisdiction of the Industrial Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5        Industrial Court however proceeded to reject the application filed by\nPetitioner-PCMC raising preliminary issue of jurisdiction and held that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">katkam                                  Page No. 48</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                  49                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nComplaint filed by the Union was maintainable by its order dated 22\nNovember 2002. Petitioner-PCMC has filed Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003\nchallenging the order on preliminary issue dated 22 November 2002. This\nCourt granted ad-interim relief in terms of prayer clause (c) of the Petition and\nstayed further proceedings of Complaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 pending\nbefore Industrial Court by its order dated 28 July 2003. Writ Petition\nNo.4931 of 2003 came to be admitted by this Court by order dated 30 April\n2004 continuing the interim relief of stay on proceedings in Complaint (ULP)\nNo.139 of 1999. It appears that the Union filed Letters Patent Appeal (Stamp)\nNo.21629 of 2004 before Division Bench, which came to be dismissed by\norder dated 3 September 2004. However, the learned Single Judge was\nrequested to decide the Petition expeditiously.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"655983\" id=\"span_7\">6        When Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003 came up for hearing before this\nCourt on 10 July 2014, a detailed order came to be passed observing that a\nReference was pending before Larger Bench of the Apex Court to resolve\ndifference of opinion in various decisions relating to maintainability of\nComplaint under <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_6\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a> where existence of employer-employee\nrelationship was disputed. Therefore, by order dated 10 July 2014, this Court\ndirected that it would be appropriate to await decision of the Reference\npending before the Apex Court. This is how the Petition remained pending.\nOrder dated 10 July 2014 was challenged by Union alongwith the workers, it\nwas representing, before the Supreme Court by filing Special Leave Petition\n(C) No.12804 of 2015. It appears that leave was granted in the said SLP by\norder dated 12 February 2019 and the same was registered as Civil Appeal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">katkam                                  Page No. 49</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                         50                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nNo.1673 of 2019. So far as the Reference made to the Larger Bench of the\nApex Court was concerned, which was noticed by this Court in order dated 10\nJuly 2014, the Supreme Court passed order dated 17 July 2019 in <a href=\"/doc/655983/\" id=\"a_7\">Raymond\nLtd. Anr. vs. Tukaram Tanaji Mandhare &amp; another</a> 1 that no specific question\nwas framed for answer by the Larger Bench.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1755655\" id=\"span_10\">The Apex Court considered Full\nBench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1755655/\" id=\"a_8\">Tukaram Tanaji Mandhare &amp; Anr. vs.\nRaymond Woollen Mills Limited &amp; Ors.2</a> and held that the position of law\nexpounded in paragraph 19 of the Full Bench Judgment lays down correct\nposition of law.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"655983\" id=\"span_11\">7        It appears that without making any application to this Court for\nvacation of interim order which had stayed the proceedings of Complaint\n(ULP) No.139 of 1999, an application was moved before the Industrial Court\non 12 January 2021 on behalf of Complainants stating that the reference in\n<a href=\"/doc/655983/\" id=\"a_9\">Tukaram Tanaji Mandhare</a> (supra) was decided by the Apex Court and that\ntherefore there was no stay to the further proceedings in the Complaint (ULP)\nNo.139 of 1999. It appears that advocate for Petitioner-PCMC agreed with the\nsaid position and on account of such joint representation made to the\nIndustrial Court, it proceeded to decide Complaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 on\nmerits. The Complaint has been allowed by the Industrial Court vide\njudgment and order dated 30 January 2023 declaring that Complainants are\nemployees of Petitioner-PCMC and that they are entitled for absorption in\nservice of Petitioner-PCMC from the dates of joining of service. The\nComplainants are also held to be entitled for benefit of arrears of wages on par\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">1        (Civil Appeal No.5077 of 2006)</span>\n2        2005 (4) Mh.L.J 1045\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">katkam                                         Page No. 50</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                             ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                  51                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nwith regular employees of the Petitioner-PCMC from the dates of their joining\nservice. In respect of Complainants who passed away during pendency of the\nComplaint, direction is given for payment of arrears of wages to their legal\nheirs from the dates of joining till the dates of their death. The final judgment\nand order dated 30 January 2023 is subject matter of challenge in Writ\nPetition No.4931 of 2003. To complete the narration of fact, Civil Appeal\nNo.1673 of 2019 has been withdrawn by the Complainants on 21 August\n2023.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">8        Mr. Kumbhakoni, the learned senior advocate appearing for Petitioner-\nPCMC would submit that the Industrial Court has proceeded to decide\nComplaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 in violation of interim order dated 30 April\n2004 passed by this Court while admitting Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003.\nThat though said interim order continuous to operate till date and has not\nbeen modified or vacated by this Court, Complainants persuaded the\nIndustrial Court to proceed ahead with the decision of the Complaint on a\nmisrepresentation that the stay granted by this Court had been vacated. That\nthus the Complaint is decided by passing final judgment and order dated 30\nJanuary 2023 in violation of interim order granted by this Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">9        Mr. Kumbhakoni would further submit that the Complaint filed by\nRespondents before the Industrial Court under provisions of <a href=\"/doc/116114456/\" id=\"a_10\">section 28</a> of the\nMRTU &amp; PULP Act was not maintainable in view of specific declarations\nsought by them about existence of employer-employee relationship as well as\nabolition of contracts executed with them. That seeking a declaration that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">katkam                                  Page No. 51</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                  52                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nRespondents are direct workers of Petitioner-PCMC contains an implicit\nadmission about existence of dispute about employer-employee relationship.\nHe would take me through the averments in the Complaint to demonstrate\nthat the entire Complaint was full of pleadings in support of declaration that\nthe contract executed by Petitioner-PCMC is sham and camouflaged. He\nwould also take me through one of the letters granting contract to demonstrate\nthat the said letter cannot be construed to mean an appointment order. That\nthe said letter did not amount to employment of the person concerned into the\nservices of the Petitioner-PCMC. He would submit that contracts were\nawarded to various persons for door-to-door collection of garbage through\npush-carts with a view to implement the cleanliness drive undertaken by the\nPetitioner-PCMC on experimental basis. That Petitioner-PCMC was not\nunder any statutory obligations to collect municipal solid waste from the doors\nof the citizens and it was thus not a part of statutory duty of the Petitioner-\nPCMC to employ any staff for door-to-door collection of garbage at the\nrelevant time. That the Municipal Solid Waste Rules were implemented much\nlater in the year 2016 and that therefore resolutions adopted Standing\nCommittee of the Petitioner-PCMC, who commenced the scheme of door-to-\ndoor collection of Municipal solid waste on experimental basis by issuing\ncontracts cannot be confused with effecting appointments in the services of the\nPetitioner-PCMC. He would submit that appointment on establishment of a\nMunicipal Corporation cannot be treated on par with appointment with a\nprivate employer. That there is a statutory framework for effecting\nappointments on the establishment of the Municipal Corporation and no\nappointment on its establishment can be effected without following a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">katkam                                  Page No. 52</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   53                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nprocedure prescribed for making such appointments. That therefore contracts\neffected with private contractors for door-to-door collection of municipal solid\nwaste can never be treated as appointments made on the establishment of the\nPetitioner-PCMC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"396352\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979210\" id=\"span_20\">10       Mr. Kumbhakoni would further submit that being fully aware of the\nposition that the concerned persons were mere contractors, they were required\nto raise a contention that the contracts awarded by the Petitioner-PCMC in\ntheir favour were sham and bogus. That the concerned persons were fully\naware that without seeking a declaration of contract being sham and bogus, it\nwas impossible to establish direct employer-employee relationship with the\nPetitioner-PCMC and this is the reason why those contractors approached the\nIndustrial Court to seek a declaration of contract being sham and bogus. In the\nlight of the dispute raised by the Complainants themselves about existence of\nemployer employee relationship, the Complaint was clearly outside the\njurisdiction of Industrial Court. He would submit that the position of law\nabout lack of jurisdiction of Industrial Court to entertain Complaint under\n<a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_11\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a> in the light of existence of dispute about employer-\nemployee relationship is well settled by the judgments of the Apex Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_12\">Cipla Limited vs. Maharashtra General Kamgar Union &amp; Ors.</a> 3 and <a href=\"/doc/396352/\" id=\"a_13\">Sarva\nShramik Sangh vs. Indian Smelting and Refining Company Limited</a> and\nothers4.</span></span> That this position is also reiterated by Division Bench judgment of this\nCourt in Asia Foundation and Construction Limited Nagpur vs. Engineering\nKamgar Sanghatana, Nagpur and another5.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">3        2001 (3) SCC 101\n4        2003 (10) SCC 455\n5        2016 (2) MhLJ 406.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">katkam                                   Page No. 53</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_3\"> k                                   54                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n11       Mr. Kumbhakoni would further submit that the Industrial Court has\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"396352\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1979210\" id=\"span_24\">erred in assuming jurisdiction and in rejecting the preliminary objection about\nmaintainability of the Complaint by holding that there is no intermediate\ncontractor between Complainants and Petitioner-PCMC or that the\nComplainants are directly working with the Petitioner-PCMC. He would\nsubmit that what is important is the factum of award of contracts to the\nconcerned Complainants and presence/absence of an intermediate contractor\nwould make no difference so long as there is a dispute about existence of\nemployer employee relationship. That this is not a case where existence of\nemployer-employee relationship is indisputable as erroneously held by the\nIndustrial Court in order dated 22 November 2002. The true ratio of the\njudgments of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_14\">Cipla Limited</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/396352/\" id=\"a_15\">Sarva Shramik\nSangh</a> (supra) is that in every case where there is dispute about employer\nemployee relationship, jurisdiction of Industrial Court under <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_16\">MRTU &amp; PULP\nAct</a> is barred.

That the Zonal Officers are not\nempowered under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/22122408/\" id=\"a_19\">MMC Act</a> to make any engagements or\nappointments of Municipal servants that therefore the first test of &#x27; who\nappoints?&#x27; fails in the present case. That the second test of &#x27;who pays the\nsalary/remuneration&#x27; also fails as no salary is paid to the Complainants and\nwhat was paid at that time was only contract price for door-to-door collection\nof garbage at fixed rate. That the third test of &#x27; who has authority to dismiss&#x27;\nagain fails in the present case as there is nothing on record to indicate that the\nPetitioner-PCMC took any decision about discontinuation of any individual\ncontractor. That it is borne out in evidence and in fact an admission in the\nComplaint itself that Complainants worked at the mercy of the Zonal Officers\nthereby indicating that the Petitioner-PCMC did not play any role in respect of\ndiscontinuation of contracts of any individual contractor. That fourth test of\n&#x27;who can take disciplinary action&#x27; also fails in the present case as there was no\nquestion of taking any disciplinary action against contractors who were never\ntreated as Municipal servants in any manner. That the fifth test of &#x27; whether\nthere is continuity of service&#x27; again does not get fulfilled in the present case as\nthis is not a case where same employee is continued through different\ncontractors and that the contract of each individual was distinct. That the sixth\ntest of &#x27;extent of control and supervision&#x27; also does not get fulfilled in the\npresent case as there is no evidence on record to prove that the Petitioner-\nPCMC ever supervised or controlled work of individual contract.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"188598354\" id=\"span_28\">Mr.\nKumbhakoni would therefore submit that even if it is assumed that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">katkam                                  Page No. 55</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   56                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial Court had jurisdiction to go into the issue of existence of employer-\nemployee relationship, none of the six tests prescribed in the Apex Court\njudgment of <a href=\"/doc/188598354/\" id=\"a_20\">Balwant Rai Saluja</a> (supra) get fulfilled in the present case.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">13       Mr. Kumbhakoni would further submit that Complainants otherwise\ndid not have any right to seek absorption in the Municipal service, mere\ncompletion of 240 days of service cannot be a ground for grant of relief of\nabsorption in service. That the Industrial Court has erred in relying on letters\nand certificates issued during pendency of proceedings for the purpose of\ninferring that Complainants are direct workers of the Petitioner-PCMC. That\nletters for admission of children of concerned Complainants in schools does\nnot create employer-employee relationship. That the Industrial Court has\nundertaken exercise of appreciation of evidence to decide employer-employee\nrelationship, which is frowned upon by Division Bench of this Court in Asia\nFoundation and Construction Limited Nagpur (supra). That the Industrial\nCourt had erroneously relied upon the alleged proposals sent by Petitioner-\nPCMC to the State Government, which are ultimately not accepted by the\nState Government. In fact, sending of such proposals clearly show that\nComplainants are not employees of Petitioner-PCMC. The proposals merely\nproposed their treatment as employees, which have been rejected by the State\nGovernment. So far as reliance by the Industrial Court on provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1711982/\" id=\"a_21\">sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/476610/\" id=\"a_22\">12</a> of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act,\n1970 is concerned, Mr. Kumbhakoni would submit that even if it is treated\nthat the contracts executed with the Complainants suffered from any infirmity,\nthe same would not convert contracts into employment.

He would rely upon definition of the term &quot;workman&quot; under\n<a href=\"/doc/66075752/\" id=\"a_24\">section 2(s)</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_25\">(ID Act</a>) in support of his\ncontention that every person engaged to perform the work of manual or\nunskilled or skilled work for hire or reward is to be treated as workman. That it\nis demonstrably proved before the Industrial Court that Petitioner-PCMC\nperforms such work for Municipal Corporation for hire or reward. That\ndefinition of the term &quot;wages&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1418464/\" id=\"a_26\">section 2(rr)</a> of the ID Act again covers\nremuneration paid in terms of employment. That therefore the remuneration\npaid to the Complainants directly by the Petitioner-PCMC fits into the\ndefinition of the term &#x27;wages&#x27; under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_27\">ID Act</a>.

He would take me through\ndefinition of the term &quot;contractor&quot; under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_28\">Contract Labour (Regulation and\nAbolition) Act</a> to demonstrate that Respondents do not fit into the definition\nof the said term. That no license is obtained by Respondents who are acting as\ncontractors of Petitioner-PCMC and it has also been an admitted position that\nengagement of the Respondents is not through any contractor. That therefore,\nrelationship between Petitioner-PCMC and Respondents is not even a matter\nof debate. Mr. Kulkarni would further submit that initial engagements of all\nComplainants are clearly referable to the Standing Committee Resolution.\nThat thus decision to engage them is taken by Petitioner-PCMC and not by\nZonal Officers as sought to be contended by Petitioner-PCMC. That Ward\nOfficers were only delegated the power of issuing letters and it cannot be said\nthat they exercised any independent authority to make engagements. He\nwould take me through various findings recorded by the Industrial Court on\npreliminary issue to demonstrate that absence of any intermediate contractor\nhas rightly been taken into consideration that the Industrial Court to infer\ndirect relationship between the Complainants and Petitioner-PCMC. That\nseveral documents indicating direct engagements of Complainants as well as\ntreating them as direct employees by Petitioner-PCMC have been considered\nby the Industrial Court. That it has been conclusively proved that direct\npayments are made to Complainants based on recording of their attendance in\nmuster. That supervision by Municipal Officers is also proved. That\nComplainants perform same job as of regular sweepers. That there are 1521\nsanctioned posts of sweepers out of which 468 were lying vacant at the time of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">katkam                                  Page No. 58</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   59                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\ndecision of the Complaint.

He would pray for dismissal of both the Petitions.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">16       Rival contentions of parties now fall for Court&#x27;s determination.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">17       Before proceeding to decide the merits of the dispute, it would be first\nnecessary to decide the issue of propriety on the part of the industrial Court in\ndeciding the Complaint even though the stay order granted by this Court was\nnever vacated. There are no two opinions on the fact that the stay order\ngranted by this Court was not vacated and continued to operate and, in that\nsense, the Industrial Court could not have decided the Complaint during\noperation of stay order of this Court. to this extent, there is impropriety on the\npart of the Industrial Court. It however appears that the both the sides are\nresponsible for this misadventure on Court&#x27;s part, as they jointly agreed before\nthe Court that the stay order no longer continued after decision of reference by\nthe larger Bench of the Apex Court. Therefore though Mr. Kumbhakoni is\nright in contending that the Industrial Court could not have decided the\nCompliant during pendency of Writ Petition No. 4931 of 2003, Petitioner-\nPCMC has to share the blame in agreeing with the counsel for complainants\nthat the stay order of this court no longer operated. Also of relevance is the fact\nthat the Compliant was pending since the year 1999 and somehow the same\nhas been finally decided, albeit with impropriety. Now both the petitions\nchallenging the order on preliminary issue as well as the final judgment and\norder are taken up for hearing and are being decided by this common\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">katkam                                   Page No. 59</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                    60                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\njudgment. Therefore, instead of attempting to correct the impropriety on the\npart of the Industrial Court by remanding the Complaint for fresh decision by\nfirst deciding the issue of maintainability, it would be appropriate to proceed\nahead by recording this Court&#x27;s displeasure on the conduct of both the parties\nin misrepresenting the Industrial Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">18.       The main objection raised by Petitioner-PCMC is about maintainability\nof the Complaint and jurisdiction of the Industrial Court to entertain the\nsame. Before proceeding to examine the exact nature of grievance raised in the\nComplaint, it would be apposite to first deal with the position of law about\njurisdiction of Industrial Court under provisions of <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_29\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a>.\n<a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_30\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a> essentially consists of two parts viz. (i) recognition of\ntrade unions for facilitating collective bargaining on behalf of workmen and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">(ii) prevention of unfair labour practices on the part of employers, trade unions\nand employees. <a href=\"/doc/102405033/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 27</a> of the MRTU &amp; PULP Act provides that no\nemployer or union and no employee shall engage in any unfair labour practice.\nThus, the Act essentially governs relationship between employer and\nemployees. <a href=\"/doc/163656659/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 26</a> of the Act provides that &#x27;unfair labour practices&#x27; means\nany of the practices listed in Schedule II, III and IV. Schedule II lists unfair\nlabour practices on the part of employees, Scheduled III lists unfair labour\npractices on the part of trade unions and Schedule IV lists general unfair\nlabour practices on the part of employers. It is on account of governance of\nrelationship between employers and employees by the <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_33\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a>\nthat existence of employer-employee relationship becomes sine qua non for\ninvocation of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/116114456/\" id=\"a_34\">section 28</a> of the MRTU &amp; PULP Act for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">katkam                                    Page No. 60</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">      ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                        61                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nfiling a Compliant relating to any unfair labour practice. If there is no\nemployer-employee relationship, the allegation of commission of unfair labour\npractice under Schedule II and Schedule IV cannot be raised because such\nunfair labour practices necessarily need to be alleged by an employee against\nhis/her employer. This is a reason why the law now is fairly well settled that\nabsence of employer-employee relationship ousts jurisdiction of Industrial\nCourt to entertain any Complaint alleging unfair labour practices under\n<a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_35\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a>. There are catena of judgments on this issue and a quick\nreference in this regard can be made to the three judgments. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979210\" id=\"span_42\">In <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_36\">Cipla Limited</a>\n(supra). It is held by the Apex Court in paragraph 8 and 11 as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         8.       But one thing is clear - if the employees are working under a contract covered by the\n         <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_37\">Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act</a> then it is clear that the Labour Court or the\n         industrial adjudicating authorities cannot have any jurisdiction to deal with the matter as it\n         falls within the province of an appropriate Government to abolish the same. If the case put\n         forth by the workmen is that they have been directly employed by the appellant Company\n         but the contract itself is a camouflage and, therefore, needs to be adjudicated is a matter\n         which can be gone into by appropriate Industrial Tribunal or Labour Court. Such question\n         cannot be examined by the Labour Court or the Industrial Court constituted under the Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">         The object of the enactment is, amongst other aspects, enforcing provisions relating to\n         unfair labour practices. If that is so, unless it is undisputed or indisputable that there is\n         employer-employee relationship between the parties, the question of unfair practice cannot\n         be inquired into at all. The respondent Union came to the Labour Court with a complaint\n         that the workmen are engaged by the appellant through the contractor and though that is\n         ostensible relationship the true relationship is one of master and servant between the\n         appellant and the workmen in question. By this process, workmen repudiate their\n         relationship with the contractor under whom they are employed but claim relationship of an\n         employee under the appellant. That exercise of repudiation of the contract with one and\n         establishment of a legal relationship with another can be done only in a regular Industrial\n         Tribunal/Court under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_38\">ID Act</a>.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1070258\" id=\"span_43\">11.

Nor can we say that\n         even in cases where employer-employee relationship is undisputed or indisputably referring\n         to the history of relationship between the parties, dispute can be settled and not in a case of\n         the present nature where it is clear that the workmen are working under a contract.

(1945) 3 DLR 225. The basic question which was also\n         raised in <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_60\">Cipla</a> case (2001) 3 SCC 101 : 2001 SCC (L&amp;S) 520 relates to the existence of the\n         relationship, and of any dispute connected with that. For getting protection under the\n         <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_61\">Maharashtra Act</a>, it has first to be established that the complainant is an employee of a\n         person under whom he claims to be an employee and against whom he files a complaint. In\n         other words, the determinative question is, can anybody who is not an &quot;employee&quot; of or\n         under a person against whom a grievance is sought to be made file a complaint under the\n         Act and the answer is inevitably &quot;No&quot;. The fundamental issue therefore is whether the\n         complainant is an employee of the person against whom a complaint is made under the\n         <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_62\">Maharashtra Act</a> and if there is a dispute, he has to establish it, first before the appropriate\n         forum designated for adjudication of such industrial disputes. <a href=\"/doc/174108864/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 32</a> does not aid the\n         appellant in the sense that it is not a matter arising out of the application, when the pre-\n         existing relationship of employer-employee is a must and an essential prerequisite. It is the\n         core issue on which only the very locus to make a complaint can at all be claimed. A person\n         who does not answer the description has no legal locus to file a complaint. A jurisdictional\n         fact is one on the existence or otherwise of which depends assumption or refusal to assume\n         jurisdiction by a court, tribunal or authority. The said fact has to be established and its\n         existence proved before a court under the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_64\">Maharashtra Act</a> can assume jurisdiction of a\n         particular case. If the complaint is made prima facie accepting existence of the contractor, in\n         such a case what has to be first established is whether the arrangement or agreement\n         between the complainant and the contractor is sham or bogus. There is an inherent\n         admission in such a situation that patently the arrangement is between the complainant and\n         the contractor and the claim for a new and different relationship itself is a disputed fact. To\n         put it differently, the complainant seeks for a declaration that such arrangement is not a real\n         one but something which is a facade. There is no direct agreement between the complainant\n         and the principal employer and one such is sought to be claimed but not substantiated in\n         accordance with law. The relief in a sense relates to a legal assumption that the hidden\n         agreement or arrangement has to be surfaced. Entries 5, 6, 9 and 10 of Schedule IV of the\n         Maharashtra-Act read as follows:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                 &quot;5.

The common thread passing through all these judgments is that the threshold question\n         to be decided is whether the industrial dispute could be raised for abolition of the contract\n         labour system in view of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_65\">Maharashtra Act</a>. What happens to an\n         employee engaged by the contractor if the contract made is abolished, is not really involved\n         in the dispute. There can be no quarrel with the proposition as contended by the appellants\n         that the jurisdiction to decide a matter would essentially depend upon pleadings in the\n         plaint. But in a case like the present one, where the fundamental fact decides the jurisdiction\n         to entertain the complaint itself, the position would be slightly different. In order to\n         entertain a complaint under the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_66\">Maharashtra Act</a> it has to be established that the claimant\n         was an employee of the employer against whom complaint is made under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_67\">ID Act</a>. When\n         there is no dispute about sach relationship, as noted in-para 9 of <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_68\">Cipla</a> case the <a href=\"/doc/4377279/\" id=\"a_69\">Maharashtra\n         Act</a> would have full application. When that basic claim is disputed obviously the issue has to\n         be adjudicated by the forum which is competent to adjudicate. The sine qua non for\n         application of the concept of unfair labour practice is the existence of a direct relationship of\n         employer and employee. Until that basic question is decided, the forum recedes to the\n         background in the sense that first that question has to be got separately adjudicated. Even if\n         it is accepted for the sake of arguments that two forums are available, the court certainly can\n         say which is the more appropriate forum to effectively get it adjudicated and that is what has\n         been precisely said in the three decisions. Once the existence of a contractor is accepted, it\n         leads to an inevitable conclusion that a relationship exists between the contractor and the\n         complainant. According to them, the contract was a facade and sham one which has no real\n         effectiveness.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979210\" id=\"span_58\">As rightly observed in <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_70\">Cipla</a> case it is the relationship existing by contractual\n         arrangement which is sought to be abandoned and negated and in its place the\n         complainant&#x27;s claim is to the effect that there was in reality a relationship between the\n         employer and the complainant directly. It is the establishment of the existence of such an\n         arrangement which decides the jurisdiction.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979210\" id=\"span_59\">That being the position, <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_71\">Cipla</a> case rightly hold\n         that an industrial depute has to be raised before the Tribunal under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_72\">ID Act</a> to have the\n         issue relating to actual nature of employment sorted out.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979210\" id=\"span_60\">That being the position, we find\n         that there is no scope for reconsidering <a href=\"/doc/1979210/\" id=\"a_73\">Cipla</a> case the view which really echoed the one\n         taken about almost a decade back.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">20       Thus in Sarva Shramik Sangh, the Apex Court held that there was no\nnecessity of taking a view different from the one taken in various previous\ndecisions including Cipla Ltd.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">21       Division Bench of this Court in Asia Foundation and Construction\nLimited Nagpur (supra), while following the ratio in Cipla Ltd and Sarva\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">katkam                                              Page No. 64</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                                 ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                        65                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nShramik Sangh has in fact gone a step ahead and has held that the Industrial\nCourt cannot even undertake the exercise of determining employer-employee\nrelationship for assuming jurisdiction. The judgment authored by His\nLordship Justice B.R. Gavai (as he then was) holds in paragraphs 20, 21, 23\nand 26 as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">         20. It could thus clearly be seen that the learned Industrial Court has gone into the exercise\n         of considering the entire evidence to come to a finding as to whether there existed an\n         employers-employee relationship between the appellants and the members of the\n         complainant - Union. With due respect, the said exercise is not permissible while\n         entertaining the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/36528656/\" id=\"a_74\">section 30</a> of the Act of 1971, as has been held by Their\n         Lordships of the Apex Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">         21. The perusal of the judgment of the learned Single Judge would reveal that the learned\n         Single Judge has examined from the aspect, as to whether the findings as recorded by the\n         learned Single Judge on the basis of evidence recorded before it were perverse or not. It will\n         be relevant to refer to paragraph No. 12 of the judgment of the learned Single Judge, as\n         follow -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                 &quot;12. These findings reached by the learned Member, Industrial Court are on the\n                 basis of evidence, which is available on record. I perused the entire evidence with\n                 the assistance of both the learned counsel and I find that the findings are not in any\n                 way perverse. The stand of the petitioners - employer that employees are engaged in\n                 loading and unloading work is therefore, apparently incorrect and the conclusion\n                 drawn by the Industrial Court in this respect, is therefore, justified.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">         23.      It could thus be seen that the learned Single Judge held that the onus was on the\n         appellants to establish that the employees were performing the work of loading and\n         unloading and then only the question as to whether the Industrial Court possesses the\n         jurisdiction to adjudicate upon disputed question of employer and employee relationship\n         would have arisen. The learned Single Judge held that since the appellants have failed to\n         prove that the employees were doing the work which is allotted to them by the Contractor,\n         such a question did not fall for consideration. The learned Single Judge, therefore, held that\n         the findings of the learned Industrial Court are not perverse. The learned Single Judge\n         further observed that the judgments which are cited by the petitioner in that respect are,\n         therefore, not relevant. With great respect, we find that the learned Single Judge has,\n         therefore, also re-appreciated the evidence to decide the question as to whether there existed\n         an employer - employee relationship or not. In our respectful view, such an enquiry could\n         not have been embarked upon in the proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/36528656/\" id=\"a_75\">section 30</a> of the Act of 1971.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">katkam                                            Page No. 65</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                                ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"> k                                         66                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">          26. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the learned Industrial Court as well as the\n          learned Single Judge have erred in going into the question as to whether the employees,\n          who were represented by the complainant, were in fact the employees of the appellants or\n          not. At the costs of repetition we find that such an enquiry was ot permissible in a complaint\n          under <a href=\"/doc/36528656/\" id=\"a_76\">section 30</a> of the Act of 171.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">22        Thus it has been held by Division Bench of this Court in Asia\nFoundation and Construction Limited Nagpur that even an enquiry into\nexistence of employer-employee relationship by appreciating the evidence is\nimpermissible once a dispute is created about existence of such relationship.\nThus, existence of employer-employee relationship is a sine qua non for\nexercise of jurisdiction to entertain a Complaint of unfair labour practice under\n<a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_77\">MRTU and PULP Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">23.       Keeping in mind the above broad principle, I now proceed to determine\nwhether there existed any dispute about employer-employee relationship and\nwhether Industrial Court could have entertained the Complaint filed by\nRespondents.

He has submitted that the findings recorded by the\nIndustrial Court also shows that the entire enquiry revolved around the\nquestion whether Respondents were mere contractors or in fact employees of\nPetitioner-PCMC. It appears that in paragraph 18 of the Judgment the\nIndustrial Court, after assessing evidence on record has recorded a finding that\n&quot;thus there is employer employee relationship between Complainants and\nRespondent No.1-PCMC&quot;. According to Mr. Kumbhakoni, there can be no\niota of doubt that the Respondents raised dispute about existence of employer-\nemployee relationship, they sought to establish such relationship and the\nIndustrial Court conducted enquiry by appreciation of evidence about\nexistence of such relationship. According to him such an exercise is clearly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">katkam                                            Page No. 71</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                               ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   72                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nimpermissible in view of law expounded by Division Bench of this Court in\nAsia Foundation and Construction Limited Nagpur (supra).\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">30       While Mr. Kumbhakoni cannot be said to be entirely wrong in\ncontending that Respondents sought to establish employer-employee\nrelationship in the Complaint and that the Industrial Court has also conducted\nan enquiry into such relationship, the issue remains as to whether such an\nenquiry was even necessary to be conducted in the facts and circumstances of\nthe present case. When workers seek a declaration of contract being sham and\nbogus, there is always engagement of workers through a contractor. In such\ncases, what is actually sought to be established is that instead of directly\nemploying the workers, they are deliberately routed through a contractor with\na view to avoid obligations arising out of labour enactments.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">31       Conceptually, there is a difference in a case (i) where a contract is\nactually awarded to an intermediatory, who then employs workers for\nexecution of the contract and (ii) where the person engaged for execution of\nwork, instead of being referred to as workman/employee is deliberately\nreferred to as a contractor. Again when it comes to availing services of persons\nfor execution of work on contract basis, there can be three types of\narrangements viz.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">         (i) where a third party contractor is awarded contract for execution of\n         particular work and the contractor employees his own manpower, with\n         or without equipment, to execute that work,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">katkam                                   Page No. 72</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                    73                         911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">          (ii) where an individual is awarded the work to be performed on\n          contract basis all by himself, with or without utilizing his own\n          equipment for execution of work,\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">          (iii) where the employer actually appoints a worker on a fixed term\n          contract basis where there is a contract of service.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">32.       There can be no dispute about the third category of contracts, which are\nnot contracts in real sense and where there is a direct relationship between the\nemployer and workmen. In that category, the relationship is not disputed, the\nworker works for the employer and draws wages, however the appointment is\noften made on a project for a fixed period and the terms and conditions are\ngoverned by contract of service and not by rules and regulations applicable to\nthe establishment.

In the third category of contracts,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">katkam                                      Page No. 73</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">      ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                        ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   74                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nComplaint of unfair labour practice can be filed under <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_85\">MRTU &amp; PULP Act</a>,\nsince no dispute exists about employer-employee relationship and the\nconcerned worker can allege unfair labour practice in relation to the services\nperformed by him/her towards execution of the concerned contract of service.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">34       The real difficulty arises in the second category of contracts described\nabove, which are involved in the present case. It must be observed here that\nthese categories of contracts are rare, especially in relation to State\nInstrumentalities. In private establishments, such individual contracts can be\nawarded e.g. awarding of contract for finalization of accounts to an individual\noutsider accountant or awarding contract for scanning of documents to an\nindividual or award of contract to complete specified data entry work of an\nestablishment. However, in State Instrumentalities such individual contracts\nare usually not awarded. The distinguishing feature of such individual contract\nis that the contractor concerned is not legally bound to work only for the\nestablishment concerned and is usually free to take up other assignments as\nwell since there is no employer-employee relationship. In the present case, it is\nsought to be contended on behalf of Petitioner-PCMC that what is awarded to\nthe Respondents are individual contracts, not creating any employer-employee\nrelationship. However, on a deeper scrutiny, in arrangement made by\nPetitioner-PCMC, to my mind, use of the words &#x27;contract&#x27; or &#x27;contractor&#x27;\nappear to be merely a semantic exercise possibly to avoid any obligation\ntowards the concerned persons with whom such arrangement is made. This is\nclear from following:\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">katkam                                   Page No. 74</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\"> k                                  75                        911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">         (i) Persons to whom contracts were issued for door to door collection of\n         Municipal solid waste by use of push-carts ( ghantagadi) were required to\n         work under complete supervision and control of the officials of\n         Petitioner-PCMC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">         (ii) The engagement letter specified time when such services were to be\n         performed i.e. 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">         (iii) Letter specified that the work was to be carried out as per\n         instructions of Health Inspector and the place and time specified by\n         him.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">         (iv) Provision was made for deduction of amount on per day basis for\n         absence,\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">         (v) Letter contained a condition for termination of work for\n         unsatisfactory work or receipt of complaints.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">         (vi) Most importantly, entire equipment for performance of the work\n         was to be provided by Petitioner-PCMC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">         (vii) The concept of issuing individual contracts for door-to-door\n         collection of garbage was commenced with approval of Standing\n         Committee who adopted resolution on 2 September 1997 for allotment\n         of work without inviting tenders.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">         (viii) The resolution provided for payment of fixed amount of Rs.\n         1,800/- per person.

After the Complaint was filed and the Respondents\nwere continued by Petitioner-PCMC, its conduct leaves no manner doubt that\nRespondents were treated nothing short of direct its employees. To make\nthings worse for Petitioner-PCMC, it started correspondence with the State\nGovernment as early as on 11 August 2000 requesting for approval to absorb\nRespondents in Municipal service. Five such proposals were sent to the State\nGovernment on 11 August 2000, 23 October 2000, 29 December 2000, 29\nDecember 2003 and 16 November 2005.

The complainants had given notice, Ex. UA- 13 requesting the respondents to\n         produce documents and application submitted by the complainants appointment\n         orders issued by the respondents to them resolution dated 26.8.1997; copy of\n         resolution dated 31.8.1998 muster-roll-cum-wage register of employees for 1997 to\n         2002. The respondents were directed to produce documents at Sr. Nos. 1 to 4, but\n         those documents are not produced on record. The alleged contracts executed by the\n         complainants are not produced on record. On the other hand, the complainants\n         have produced documents along with Ex. UA-19. By letter dated 1.7.2000.\n         Additional Commissioner of Respondent No.1 Corpn, directed the Head Master of\n         Resident Govt. Vidhyaniketan, Jail Road, Yerawada, Pune-6 to admit pupils of\n         Ghanta Gadi employee Shri Ganesh Baban Pawar-Kum. Tukaram Ganesh Pawar\n         and Kum. Mukta Ganewh Pawar in third and second standard respectively. A\n         Certificate has been issued on 22.11.1997 for one Shri Anant Sahadeo Gothal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">katkam                                       Page No. 76</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                          ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                     77                          911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n         certifying that he is working as Ghanta Gadi Karmachari. The certificate is issued by\n         Sanitary Inspector. By letter dated 17.12.1998. The Municipal Commissioner\n         directed to provide free medical facilities to Ghanta Gadi employees. Letter dated\n         11.10.1999 issued by Commissioner of Respondent No.1 Corpn. directing Ghanta\n         Gadi employees to work on Pulse Polio Campaign on 24.10.1999, 21.11.1999,\n         19.12.1999 and 23.1.2000. Several documents are produced on record that the\n         Commissioner Additional Commissioner of Respondent No.1 Corpn. issued\n         directions to Ghanta Gadi employees. By letter dated 2,6,2002, the Zonal Officer\n         directed the employees for doing cleaning and sanitary including Ghanta Gadi\n         employee Shri Santosh Borse. If all the documents produced with list, Ex. UA-19 are\n         considered, repeatedly directions are issued to Ghanta Gadi employees by different\n         Officers of Respondent No.1.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">37       The above findings would leave no manner of doubt that right since\nbeginning, Petitioner-PCMC always treated Respondents as their employees.\nReliance is placed on a document issued as early as on 22 November 1997\ncertifying that one of the Respondent Shri Anant Sahadeo Gothal was working\nas &#x27;Ghantagadi Karmachari&#x27;. It is not disputed that Municipal Commissioner\ndirected provision of free medical facilities to Respondents. They have been\ndeployed to work on Pulse Polio Campaign implemented by Petitioner-\nPCMC. Their children were admitted in schools by treating them as\n&#x27;Ghantagadi employees&#x27;. In addition to collection of door-to-door garbage,\ntheir services were also utilized for other cleaning and sanitary activities. While\nMr. Kumbhakoni has sought to dissuade this Court from relying on the said\nactions for twin reasons of (i) above actions being taken by lower-level\nMunicipal officials, which does not create employer-employee relationship,\nand (ii) occasional utilization of Respondents on other works on account of\ngrant of interim stay by the Industrial Court. However, I am not impressed by\neither of the reasons. The entire executive power under the <a href=\"/doc/22122408/\" id=\"a_86\">MMC Act</a> vests in\nMunicipal Commissioner under section 67(3). It is not that the Municipal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">katkam                                        Page No. 77</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                           ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   78                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner must always himself exercise such executive powers, Municipal\nCommissioner is authorized to delegate his powers and functions to lower-\nlevel officials. It would therefore be too far-fetched to contend that the acts of\nWard Officers or Assistant Commissioners or Superintendents would not bind\nPetitioner-PCMC in any manner. In fact, the argument of Zonal Officers/Ward\nOfficers issuing individual contracts not amounting to making of appointment\nby Petitioner-PCMC is also premised similar argument of their acts not\nbinding Petitioner-PCMC. In my view, this contention sought to be raised on\nbehalf of Petitioner-PCMC is stated only to be rejected. The concerned Zonal\nOfficer/Ward Officer has acted as per the decision taken by the Standing\nCommittee of the Petitioner-PCMC. It is not disputed that the Municipal\nCommissioner has issued directions for provision of free medical facilities to\nRespondents. They are always treated and described as &quot; Ghantagadi\nKarmachari&#x27;. Except initial engagement letters describing them as &#x27;Ghantagadi\nContractor&#x27;, most of the documents/correspondence uses the word\n&quot;Karmachari&quot; (employee) to describe them. Thus, Respondents were always\ntreated as employees and not contractors.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">38       Considering the above position, I am of the view that it was not\nnecessary for Respondents to seek a declaration about existence of employer-\nemployee relationship on account of the fact that they were always treated as\nemployees by the Petitioner-PCMC for all practical purposes. As observed\nabove, declaration of existence of employer-employee relationship becomes\nnecessary only where workers are employed through intermediate contractor.\nWhen there is no third person available in respect of arrangement between\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">katkam                                   Page No. 78</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                            79                             911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nentity awarding so called contract and the contractor concerned, there is no\nquestion of seeking any declaration of contract being sham and bogus. This is\nbecause there was already a direct relationship between Petitioner and\nRespondents. It is Petitioner who was directly paying them the amounts for\nperformance of work. It was Petitioner who had power to terminate their so-\ncalled contracts. The directions to work in particular manner and at particular\nplace was also issued by the municipal officials. Therefore, there was no\narrangement which was required to be declared sham or bogus. In my view,\ntherefore the usual principle of non-maintainability of Complaint of unfair\nlabour practice on account of existence of dispute of employer-employee\nrelationship would not be attracted in the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_72\">39       Respondents could have and ought to have simply sought a declaration\nfor their absorption in Municipal service and in fact such a relief was sought in\nsecond part of prayer clause (c) in the Complaint wherein prayer was made\nthat &quot;be directed to make all the workers permanent from the date of joining of\nduties.....&quot; On account of unnecessary debate created by Respondents before\nthe Industrial Court relating to declaration of they being employees of\nPetitioner-PCMC, objection relating to maintainability of the Complaint and\njurisdiction of Industrial Court was raised, which in my view was quite\nunnecessary.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">40       Petitioner-PCMC            itself        has     placed      on     record      some       of    the\ncorrespondence that took place between it and the State Government on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">katkam                                                  Page No. 79</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                                     ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                  80                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nsubject of absorption of Respondents in service. Though all the proposals since\nthe year 2000 are not placed on record, one such proposal dated 17 April 2008\nis produced alongwith the Petition. The proposal was sent by the Municipal\nCommissioner to the Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department,\nMantralaya, Mumbai. The proposal referred to the scheme of cleanliness\nimplemented by the then Municipal Commissioner in the year 1997, which\nincluded inter alia door to door garbage collection by use of pushcarts. The\nproposal then referred to the number of persons engaged on pushcarts as\ncontractors. Reference is made to Complaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"179794777\" id=\"span_93\">The\nproposal thereafter gave details of total 353 contractors, who had rendered\nservices ranging between 7 to 9 years. The proposal also referred to various\nresolutions adopted by General Body and Standing Committee for absorption\nof such Ghantagadi employees in Municipal service. This is how, proposal was\nsent to the State Government pointing out that Respondents were willing to\ngive-up claim for backwages and that in the event of Complaint being allowed,\nPetitioner-PCMC would be burdened with amount of Rs. 29.04 crores\ntowards backwages. It appears that the proposal of Petitioner-PCMC has been\nrejected by the State Government vide letter dated 18 May 2010 essentially\nreferring to the judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/179794777/\" id=\"a_87\">Secretary, State of Karnataka\nand others vs. Umadevi</a> and others7 holding that the Respondents were back-\ndoor entrants. Without going into the aspect of entitlement of Respondents to\nregularization at this juncture, what is necessary to note in the State\nGovernment&#x27;s Reply dated 18 May 2010 is repeated use of the word &#x27;backdoor\nentry&#x27;. The State Government thus did not reject the proposal stating that the\n\n\n7        AIR 2006 SC 1806\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">katkam                                  Page No. 80</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                        81                          911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\npure contractor cannot be absorbed in Municipal service in absence of\nemployer-employee relationship.

No doubt, Petitioner-PCMC\ninitially adopted a defence that Respondents were pure contractors, however\nduring pendency of the litigation in last 25 long years, it has definitely\nchanged its stance and has been treating them virtually as their employees.\nTherefore, though Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003 continuous to remain\npending raising the issue of maintainability of the Complaint, alteration in the\nstand of the Petitioner-PCMC by repeatedly sending proposals for absorption\nof Respondents in service by treating them as employees of Petitioner-PCMC\nhas definitely reduced the severity of objection of maintainability of the\nComplaint.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">42       In fact when Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003 had come up before this\nCourt on 10 July 2014, the learned Judge (N.

It may, however, be\n                 made clear that what the Apex Court has held is in a case where the Contractor is\n                 a contractor registered under the Contract Labour Regulations Employment Act.\n                 There are situations wherein the employees are made contractors, and may in\n                 situations be registered under the Contract Labour Regulations Employment Act\n                 whether on the facts of such cases would the Courts under the <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_95\">M.R.T.U. &amp;\n                 P.U.L.P.

The question therefore arose is, whether the Respondent Union can maintain a\n         complaint on the ground that they are employees of the Petitioner Corporation but they\n         were wrongly shown as working on contract without any contracts in between. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"396352\" id=\"span_101\">In the case of\n         <a href=\"/doc/396352/\" id=\"a_97\">Sarva Shramik Sangh</a> (supra), the Apex Court, in paragraph 23 reproduced above, has laid\n         down a wider proposition that it is necessary for the complainant to show, as a condition\n         precedent, to have been treated by the employer as his employee, and unless this is shown,\n         the Court will have no jurisdiction. It is not a question of ouster of jurisdiction but\n         acceptance of the status as an employee is a condition precedent. Therefore, the question is\n         whether these observations, which are in wide terms are to be made applicable to the facts of\n         the present case as well and to hold that the complaint is not maintainable. Before doing so,\n         it will have to be kept in mind that the <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_98\">M.R.T.U. &amp; P.U.L.P. Act</a> is a beneficial legislation\n         meant to provide the workmen with expeditious additional remedy, and the provisions of\n         this Act have been liberally construed.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">                                                                                      (emphasis added)\n\n\n43       Thus the usual objection of bar of jurisdiction to entertain complaint of\nunfair labour practice in the light of existence of dispute as employer-employee\nwould not apply to the present case, where there is no triangular arrangement\nof principal employer, third part contractor and worker. Use of the words\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">katkam                                            Page No. 82</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                               ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                    83                       911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n&#x27;contract&#x27; and &#x27;contractor&#x27; in the present case is nothing but a semantic exercise\nand Petitioner has virtually employed Respondents. Therefore, declaration of\nRespondents being employees of Petitioner was not necessary in the\nCompliant. Even if, it is to be assumed that such declaration was needed, the\nsaid declaration cannot be put on the same pedestal as that of a declaration of\ncontract beings sham and bogus in a triangular arrangement of principal\nemployer, contractor and worker.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">44.       Considering the peculiar facts of the present case, where there is no\nintermediate contractor between Petitioner-PCMC and Respondents coupled\nwith paradigm shift in Petitioner&#x27;s stance by treating them as employees, in my\nview, the objection of maintainability of Complaint and jurisdiction of\nIndustrial Court needs to be repelled. As observed above, it was not necessary\nfor Respondents to seek a declaration of existence of employer-employee\nrelationship as use of the word &#x27;contract&#x27; or &#x27;contractor&#x27; to describe the\narrangement is nothing but a semantic exercise, when in fact the Respondents\nhave actually worked for Petitioner-PCMC for remuneration. In absence of\nintermediate contractor, declaration of contract being sham and bogus cannot\nbe, and in the present case, need not be sought. It is therefore held that\nRespondents are not contractors, but merely contract employees of Petitioner\nMunicipal Corporation. I am therefore of the view that neither Order dated 22\nNovember 2002 on preliminary issue nor the final judgment and order dated\n30 January 2023 suffer from any jurisdictional error. The Industrial Court has\nrightly entertained the Complaint of the Respondents and adjudicated their\ndemand for absorption in service.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">katkam                                    Page No. 83</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">      ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\"> k                                         84                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">45.       Since it is held that Respondents were/are not contractors but contract\nemployees of the Municipal Corporation, it is not necessary to consider the\nissue of fulfilment of 6 tests <a href=\"/doc/396352/\" id=\"a_99\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court in Balwant Singh\nSaluja.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">46        Having answered the issue of maintainability of Complaint and\njurisdiction of Industrial Court, the next issue is about entitlement of\nRespondents to seek absorption in service of Petitioner-PCMC. Once\nRespondents are treated as employees of Petitioner-PCMC, the length of\nservice rendered by them since initial engagements will have to be considered\nand by now, they have rendered more than 25 years of service. In fact, many of\nthem have expired during pendency of the litigation.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"179794777\" id=\"span_106\">47.       Since the case involves the issue of absorption of Respondents in\nmunicipal service, the same cannot be resolved without making reference to\nthe landmark judgment of the Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/179794777/\" id=\"a_100\">Umadevi</a> (supra). After\nthe judgment in Umadevi, regularization of casual/adhoc/temporary/contract\nemployees in Government services is now virtually impermissible merely on\nthe basis of length of service rendered by such employees. In paragraph 43 of\nthe judgment the Apex Court has held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">          &quot;43. Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment is a basic\n          feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of our Constitution, a court\n          would certainly he disabled from passing an order upholding a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 14</a> or in\n          ordering the overlooking of the need to comply with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 14</a> read\n          with <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 16</a> of the Constitution. Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public\n          employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold that unless the\n          appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a proper competition among qualified\n          persons, the same would not confer any right on the appointee. If it is a contractual\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">katkam                                             Page No. 84</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">      ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                               ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                         85                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n         appointment, the appointment comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an\n         engagement or appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end\n         when it is discontinued. Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to be made\n         permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment. It has also to be clarified that merely\n         because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the\n         term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made\n         permanent, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not\n         made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. It is not\n         open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the instance of temporary employees\n         whose period of employment has come to an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very\n         nature of their appointment, do not acquire any right. The High Courts acting under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_104\">Article\n         226</a> of the Constitution, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, regularisation,\n         or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was made regularly and in terms of\n         the constitutional scheme. Merely because an employce had continued under cover of an\n         order of the court, which we have described as &quot;litigious employment&quot; in the earlier part of\n         the judgment, he would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in\n         the sorvice. In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing interim\n         directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it is found entitled to\n         relief, it may be possible for it to mould the velief in such a manner that ultimately no\n         prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an interim direction to continue his couployment\n         would hold up the regular procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of\n         paying an employee who is really not required. The courts must be careful in ensuring that\n         they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its affairs by the State or its\n         instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments to facilitate the bypassing of the\n         constitutional and statutory mandates.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">48       A onetime exception however is carved out in Umadevi for\nregularization of irregularly appointed employees against regularly sanctioned\nposts, who had worked for 10 years without intervention of orders of Courts or\nTribunals. In paragraph 53 the Apex Court has directed as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1550283\" id=\"span_109\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"26873\" id=\"span_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"39234\" id=\"span_111\">&quot;53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be cases where irregular\n                 appointments (not illegal appointments) as explained in <a href=\"/doc/39234/\" id=\"a_105\">State of Mysore vs. S.V.\n                 Narayanappa</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/26873/\" id=\"a_106\">1967) 1 SCR 128, R.

In that context, the Union of\n                 India, the State Governments and their instrumentalities should take steps to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">katkam                                             Page No. 85</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                                ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                        86                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n                 regularise as a one-time measure, the services of such irregularly appointed, who\n                 have worked for ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not under cover of\n                 orders of the Courts or of tribunals and should further ensure that regular\n                 recruitments are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts that require to be\n                 filled up, in cases where temporary employees or daily wagers are being now\n                 employed. The process must be set in motion within six months from this date. We\n                 also clarify that regularisation, if any already made, but not subjudice, need not be\n                 reopened based on this judgment, but there should be no further bypassing of the\n                 constitutional requirement and regularising or making permanent, those not duly\n                 appointed as per the constitutional scheme.&quot;</span></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60341255\" id=\"span_114\">49       If the claims of Respondents are to be considered strictly in accordance\nwith the judgment of Constitution Bench in Umadevi obviously they cannot\nbe absorbed in service. Similarly, the claim for absorption in service merely on\ncompletion of 240 days of service under clause 4-C of Model Standing Orders\nformulated under <a href=\"/doc/1376794/\" id=\"a_108\">Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946</a> is\nfrowned upon by the Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/60341255/\" id=\"a_109\">The Municipal Council,\nTirora and another vs. Tulsidas Baliram Bindhade</a> 8, in which it is held in\nparagraphs 19 to 21 as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">                 19.       In this reference, the position emerging before us is similar. There is no\n                 conflict between the provisions of M.S.O. 4C and the provisions of the section 76 of\n                 the 1965 Act. In the event of the appointment having been made validly, it may be\n                 possible to invoke the provisions Cl. 4C of M.S.O. A view to the contrary would\n                 result in regularizing/validating a void act. Cl. 4C neither permits nor contemplates\n                 the same. As held in the above judgments, if the appointment is not made in\n                 accordance with the constitutional scheme, it is void ab initio and, therefore, there\n                 can be no claim to its regularization or for grant of permanency in any manner. This\n                 is all the more so as Cl. 32 of the M.S.O. clarifies that the Standing Orders are not\n                 to operate in derogation of any other law i.e, section 76 of 1965 Act. Definitely any\n                 interpretation of Clause 4C conducive to defeating the Constitutional mandate is\n                 unwarranted. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88198281\" id=\"span_115\">Violation of Clause 4C of the MSO may tantamount to an unfair\n                 labour practice under item 9 of Sch.

IV thereof cannot be reached. As explained by the\n                 Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/88198281/\" id=\"a_110\">Maharashtra SRTC vs. Casteribe Rajya Parivahan\n                 Karmchari Sanghatana</a>, (supra), existence of a legal vacancy must be established and\n                 as discussed above, the power to recruit with the employer must also be\n\n8        2016 (6) MhLJ 867\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">katkam                                            Page No. 86</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                               ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                       87                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n                demonstrated. In absence thereof, workman cannot succeed in proving the\n                commission of unfair labour practice under Item 6 by the employer. These two\n                ingredients, therefore, also must be established when benefit of Cl. 4C is being\n                claimed. Unless availability of a vacancy is shown or then power with the employer\n                to create the post and to fill it is brought on record, mere continuation of 240 days\n                cannot and does not enable the workman to claim permanency by taking recourse\n                to Cl. 4C read with Item 9 of Sch. IV of 1971 Act. Clause 4C does not employ word\n                &quot;regularisation&quot; but then it is implicit in it as no &quot;permanency&quot; is possible without\n                it. Conversely, it follows that when a statutory provision like section 76 disables the\n                employer either from creating or filling in the posts, such a claim cannot be\n                sustained.</span> This also nullifies the reliance upon the judgment of learned Single Judge\n                in case of Maharashtra Lok Kamgar Sanghatana vs. Ballarpur Industries Limited\n                (supra) where the employer was a private Company not subjected to such regulatory\n                measures by any Statute and enjoyed full freedom to create the posts and to recruit.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139995627\" id=\"span_118\">One of us (B.P.

It is clear from the reading of this\n         judgment that such a power is to be exercised when the employer has indulged in unfair\n         labour practice by not filling up permanent posts even when available and continuing to\n         employ workers on temporary/daily-wage basis and taking the same work from them and\n         making them do some purpose which was being performed by the regular workers but\n         paying them much less wages. It is only when a particular practice is found to be unfair\n         labour practice, as enumerated in Schedule IV of the MRTP and PULP Act, and it\n         necessitates giving direction under <a href=\"/doc/36528656/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 30</a> of the said Act, that the court would give such\n         a direction.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">         35. We are conscious of the fact that the aforesaid judgment is rendered under the MRTP\n         and PULP Act and the specific provisions of that Act were considered to ascertain the\n         powers conferred upon the Industrial Tribunal/ Labour Court by the said Act. At the same\n         time, it also hardly needs to be f emphasised that the powers of the industrial adjudicator\n         under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_132\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> are equally wide. <a href=\"/doc/166190666/\" id=\"a_133\">The Act</a> deals with industrial disputes.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">         provides for conciliation, adjudication and settlements, and regulates the rights of the parties\n         and the enforcement of the awards and settlements. Thus, by empowering the adjudicator\n         authorities under the Act to give reliefs such as reinstatement of wrongfully dismissed or\n         discharged workmen, 9 which may not be permissible in common law or justified under the\n         terms of the contract between the employer and such workmen, the legislature has\n         attempted to frustrate the unfair labour practices and secure the policy of collective\n         bargaining as a road to industrial peace.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">         39.     On a harmonious reading of the two judgments discussed in detail above, we are of\n         the opinion that when there are posts available, in the absence of any unfair labour practice\n         the Labour Court would not give direction for regularisation only because a worker has\n         continued as daily-wage worker/ad hoc/temporary worker for number of years. Further, if\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">katkam                                             Page No. 89</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">    ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                                 ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                         90                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n         there are no posts available, such a direction for regularisation would be impermissible. In\n         the aforesaid circumstances giving of direction to regularise such a person, only on the basis\n         of number of years put in by such a worker as daily-wager, etc. may amount to back door\n         entry into the service which is an anathema to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Further, such a\n         direction would not be given when the worker concerned does not meet the eligibility\n         requirement of the post in question as per the recruitment rules. However, wherever it is\n         found that similarly situated workmen are regularised by the employer itself under some\n         scheme or otherwise and the workmen in question who have approached the\n         Industrial/Labour Court are on a par with them, direction of regularisation in such cases\n         may be legally justified, otherwise, non-regularisation of the left-over workers itself would\n         amount to invidious discrimination qua them in such cases and would be violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_135\">Article\n         14</a> of the Constitution. Thus, the industrial adjudicator would be achieving the equality by\n         upholding <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 14</a>, rather than violating this constitutional provision.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">         40. The aforesaid examples are only illustrative. It would depend on the facts of each case as\n         to whether the order of regularisation is necessitated to advance justice or it has to be denied\n         if giving of such a direction infringes upon the employer&#x27;s rights.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">                                                                                       (emphasis added)\n\n\n51       Thus in Hari Nandan Prasad &amp; Anr. Apex Court has held that if posts\nare not available, issuance of directions for regularization is impermissible and\nsuch directions cannot be issued only on the basis of number of years put in by\na daily wager. However some exceptions are carved out by the Apex Court\nsuch as regularization of similarly placed workmen, regularization in pursuance\nof the scheme etc. In paragraph 40 of the judgment, the Apex Court has\nclarified that such examples are merely illustrative and that it would depend on\nfacts of each case as to whether order of regularization is necessitated to\nadvance justice or it has to be denied if giving such direction infringes upon\nthe employer&#x27;s rights.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">52       In the present case, the observations of the Apex Court in paragraph 39\nand 40 of the judgment in Hari Nandan Prasad needs to be invoked in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">katkam                                             Page No. 90</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                                ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                        91                           911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nlight of Petitioner-PCMC&#x27;s own eagerness to absorb Respondents in service.\nThus, where the employer himself is eager to absorb its temporary workers in\nservice, the same can be treated as one of the exceptions envisaged under\nparagraphs 39 and 40 of the judgment in Hari Nandan Prasad. In the present\ncase, if the State Government was to accord sanction to the proposals sent by\nPetitioner-PCMC, Respondents would have been long since absorbed in\nservice. The Petitioner-PCMC is prevented from absorbing them in service\nonly on account of refusal to sanction the proposal by State Government.\nCareful perusal of letter dated 18 May 2010 of the State Government would\nindicate that there is no absolute refusal to accord sanction for the proposals\nmooted by successive Municipal Commissioners based on resolutions adopted\nby General Body and Standing Committee. One of the reasons why the\nproposal was rejected was on account of pendency of Writ Petition No.4931 of\n2003 in this Court. In the last paragraph of the letter dated 18 May 2010 the\nState Government has referred to the pending litigation. Thus, when the\nproposal was rejected by the State Government on 18 May 2010 both\nComplaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 as well as Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003\nwere pending. Thus, pendency of legal proceedings was possibly one of the\nreasons why the State Government thought it appropriate reject the proposals\nof the Petitioner-PCMC.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">53.               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176379200\" id=\"span_143\">In <a href=\"/doc/176379200/\" id=\"a_137\">Nihal Singh v.

One of the reasons why Writ Petition\nNo.1860 of 2024 appears to have been filed by the Petitioner-PCMC\nchallenging the final order of Industrial Court is on account of direction for\nabsorption from dates of joining as well as for payment of arrears of benefits\nand wages from the dates of joining. It appears that in the proposal dated 17\nApril 2018, the Petitioner-PCMC had computed the liability towards\nbackwages at Rs. 29.04 crores which by now must have escalated substantially\nafter passage of six years from the date of said proposal. The Petitioner-\nMunicipal Commissioner had recorded in its proposal, the willingness on the\npart of Respondents to give-up claim for backwages in the event of their\nabsorption in service.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">56       Considering the overall conspectus of the case in my view, direction for\nabsorption of Respondents in Municipal services does not warrant any\ninterference. The Industrial Court has however awarded absorption from the\ninitial dates of engagements, which in my view would not be appropriate\nconsidering the facts and circumstances of the present case. The direction for\npayment of arrears of wages and benefits from the dates of initial engagement\nis not only unwarranted, but it will also put huge financial burden on the\nPetitioner-PCMC. Remanding the Compliant for decision of date for grant of\nabsorption would further lengthen the litigation which has ensued for the last\n25 long years. It would therefore be appropriate to decide the date from the\nwhich the benefit of absorption is to be granted in the unique facts and\ncircumstances of the case. It has come of record that the Municipal\nCorporation resolved to absorb Respondents in service vide Resolution\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">katkam                                   Page No. 93</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   94                        911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\nNo.5563 on 18 August 2005. In my view therefore, it would be appropriate to\ndirect absorption of Respondents from the date on which the Petitioner-\nPCMC adopted first Resolution No. 5563 on 18 August 2005 without\ngranting any backwages to the concerned Respondents. Once Respondents are\ntreated as regular Municipal servants with effect from 18 August 2005, in\nrespect of 20 workers, who have unfortunately passed away during pendency\nof litigation, their heirs would be in a position to receive at least pensionary\nbenefits from the dates of their respective deaths. It is however clarified that\nthe directions for absorption are being given considering the unique facts and\ncircumstances of the case, not because of Respondents&#x27; continuation in services\nfor long time (mainly owing to interim orders), but because the Municipal\nCorporation repeatedly resolved to absorb them in service. The directions\ntherefore shall not be read to mean that in every case, mere continuation in\nservice for a long time would entitle temporary or contract employees the\nbenefit of absorption.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">57       I accordingly proceed to pass the following order:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">                                         ORDER\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">         i)      Order dated 22 November 2002 passed by Industrial Court on\n         preliminary issue in Complaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 is upheld and\n         Writ Petition No.4931 of 2003 is dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">         ii)     Judgment and order dated 30 January 2023 passed by Industrial\n         Court in Complaint (ULP) No.139 of 1999 is modified to the extent\n         that the concerned persons included in the list filed alongwith the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">katkam                                    Page No. 94</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">     ::: Uploaded on - 20/08/2024                       ::: Downloaded on - 21/08/2024 10:05:43 :::</span>\n k                                   95                         911_wp_1860.24___1_J_as.doc\n\n\n\n\n         Complaint shall be deemed to have been absorbed in Municipal service\n         and made permanent with effect from 18 August 2005, which is the\n         date of first Resolution adopted by the General Body of the Petitioner-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">         PCMC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">         iii)    Respondents shall however not be entitled to any backwages\n         arising out of benefit of absorption in service and permanency with\n         effect from 18 August 2005.
