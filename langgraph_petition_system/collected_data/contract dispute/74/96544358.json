These are two petitions invoking the jurisdiction of this\n\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The first petition\n\nis by M/s.MEP RGSL Toll Bridge Pvt. Ltd. (for short &quot;MEPRGSL&quot;), the\n\nsecond petition is by Raima Toll &amp; Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (for short\n\n&quot;Raima&quot;). Both the petitioners (collectively referred as &quot;petitioners&quot;)\n\nare stated to be &#x27;Special Purpose Vehicles&#x27; of one &#x27;MEP Infrastructure\n\nDevelopers Limited&#x27;. The petitioners were beneficiaries of                 &#x27;toll\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Prashant Rane                                                               2/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">                             -3-                       wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\ncontracts&#x27; awarded by respondent no.1-Maharashtra State Road\n\nDevelopment Corporation Limited (for short &quot;MSRDC&quot;), which were at\n\ndifferent locations and for different periods.          The contract period in\n\nregard to both these contracts, has long expired. There is no relation\n\nbetween these two contracts, however as the cause of action being\n\ncommon, these petitions are tagged together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.              On the above prefatory lines, we note that the prayers as\n\nmade by the petitioners are quite peculiar, which are inter alia of a\n\nnature, that the MSRDC, be directed by a writ of this Court, to provide\n\nfor an &#x27;arbitration&#x27; qua these toll collection contracts entered by the\n\nMSRDC with the petitioners. There is also a somewhat incongruous\n\nprayer in the first petition, namely for a declaration that Clause 36 of\n\nthe agreement dated 29 January 2014 entered between the MSRDC and\n\nthe petitioner, is itself in the nature of an arbitration agreement. It\n\nwould be appropriate to note the prayers in both the petitions which\n\nread thus:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                In Writ Petition no.1699 of 2019\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                (a)     Issue a writ in the nature of mandamus to Respondent\n                No.1 and 2 to act in consonance with Notification No. Shashan\n                Nirnay 2016/P.K.20/KA-19 dated 13.10.2016 and thereby take\n                necessary steps to provide for a dispute resolution mechanism\n                through Arbitration under the auspices of an Arbitration\n                Institute (such as the Respondent No.5 institute) duly\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Prashant Rane                                                                    3/56</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                  -4-                          wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\n                    recognized by the Govt. of Maharashtra;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                    (b)      Declare and direct the Clause 36 of the Agreement dated\n                    29/01/2014 between the Petitioner and Respondent No.1 is\n                    itself in the nature of arbitration agreement;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">                                    In Writ Petition No.2337 of 2019\n\n                    (A)     That this Hon&#x27;ble Court be pleased to issue an\n                    appropriate writ order and direction directing the Respondent\n                    No.1 and 2 follow, observe and obey the policy guidelines as\n                    well as directors of the central government as well as the state\n                    government (as detailed and annexed in the writ petition) and\n                    take a fresh decision on the offer of the petitioner to go for an\n                    arbitration for redressal of the grievances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                    (B)     That this Hon&#x27;ble Court be pleased to issue an\n                    appropriate writ order and directions directing the Respondent\n                    No.1 and 2 to follow the same procedure of alternative dispute\n                    redressal that they have adopted in Clause No.63 (Vol-III) of the\n                    Project Implementation &amp; Securitization of toll at Five Mumbai\n                    Entry Points along with maintenance of flyover &amp; Allied\n                    Structure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">3.

The State Government is impleaded as respondent no.3, as\n\nit is the petitioners case that the State Government by its notification\n\ndated 13 October 2016 has inter alia provided for an &quot;Institutional\n\nArbitration Policy&quot;, as a preferred mode of dispute resolution in respect\n\nof Government contracts.          The petitioner contends that respondent\n\nno.5-&#x27;Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration&#x27; is an               arbitration\n\ncentre, recognized by the State Government, under the said policy\n\nnotification, which provides for a platform for institutional arbitration,\n\nfor     adjudication   of   contractual   disputes    in    which      the    State\n\nGovernment/ its instrumentalities are parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">5.              The MSRDC in or about 2013 invited bids for appointment\n\nof a contractor for operation and maintenance of &#x27;Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link\n\nProject &amp; Toll Plaza &amp; Collection of Toll&#x27; on Upfront basis.

Several parties including the parent company of the\n\npetitioner-MEPIDPL participated in the said tender issued by the\n\nMSRDC. The highest bidder was to be awarded the tender for toll\n\ncollection. MEPIDPL&#x27;s bid was the highest bid, of an amount of\n\nRs.227.70 crores, for the contract period 156 weeks (three years). In\n\npursuance thereto the MSRDC addressed a negotiation letter dated 22\n\nNovember 2013 to the MEPIDPL to submit a revised offer. The MSRDC&#x27;s\n\nletter was responded by MEPIDPL on 5 December 2013 whereby it\n\nagreed to pay Rs.50 lakhs as upfront payment over and above the\n\nfinancial offer as quoted. The MSRDC accepted this revised offer and\n\nissued a letter of acceptance dated 10 January 2014 to the MEPIDPL for\n\na contract period of 156 weeks (6 February 2014 to 1 February 2017).\n\nOn 13 January 2014 the MEPIDPL sought approval for a contract to be\n\nentered with the petitioner, being a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)\n\ncreated for the said contract. On 17 January 2014 the MSRDC granted\n\nits approval to the SPV proposal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Prashant Rane                                                           6/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">                              -7-                         wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">7.              Accordingly, on 29 January 2014 an agreement came to be\n\nentered between the MSRDC and the petitioner, under which the\n\npetitioner was appointed as a contractor for operation and maintenance\n\nof this toll project.

In paragraph 3(k) of the petition the petitioner has stated\n\nthat Clause 36.a of the said agreement is a clause which is akin to an\n\narbitration clause.

Ramesh Chander &amp; Ors.</a> 1. In paragraph\n\n3(n) referring to the decisions of the different High Courts, the\n\npetitioner contends that Clause 36a would be required to be recognized\n\nas an arbitration clause. The averments in paragraph 3(n) of the\n\npetition are also required to be noted which read thus:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                &quot;3(n). That several High Courts have rendered innumerable\n                judgments where dispute resolution clauses akin to Clause\n                36a.0 in the present case have been held to be in the nature of\n                an Arbitration Agreement. This has been done by Delhi High\n                Court by giving pragmatic interpretation to the concerned\n                clauses even if the word &quot;arbitration&quot; is not used in the relevant\n                clauses and even if the clause does not indicate as to whether\n                the adjudicating authority is to act in a judicial and impartial\n                manner and / or take a decision after hearing both the parties\n                and permitting both the parties to adduce the evidence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">10.             Further case of the petitioner is that even if there is a\n\nlacuna in the arbitration clause (clause 36a), the Court would interpret\n\n1    (2007)5 SCC 719\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Prashant Rane                                                                        8/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">                         -9-                    wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nthe same so as to fill in the necessary gap. The petitioner also contends\n\nthat even assuming that Clause 36.a is not in the nature of the\n\narbitration agreement, however, in terms of the policy decision as taken\n\nby the State of Maharashtra as contained in the notification dated 13\n\nOctober 2016, the existing contract would be required to be suitably\n\namended/altered so as to provide, that the disputes be referred to\n\narbitration, under the auspices of a recognized arbitral institute namely\n\nthe respondent no.5-Mumbai Centre for International Arbitration. This\n\naccording to the petitioner would be mandatory for the MSRDC, in\n\nterms of the prevalent policy. It is contended that it is illegal and\n\narbitrary to disregard the scope, purport and intent of the State policy\n\nand deny the remedy of arbitration to the petitioner.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">11.             The petitioner next contends that the State&#x27;s arbitration\n\npolicy is impliedly recognized in an earlier agreement (which is prior to\n\nthe policy notification) entered between the petitioner&#x27;s parent\n\ncompany and the MSRDC, under which the nature of the work was\n\nsimilar, namely toll collection, in respect of the five Mumbai entry\n\npoints. This contract was awarded by the MSRDC for the period\n\nbetween 20 November 2010 to 19 November 2026 (ie; for a period of\n\n16 years) under which, an arbitration agreement was provided in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Prashant Rane                                                             9/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">                            - 10 -                 wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nClause 63 to refer the disputes which may arise between the parties, for\n\nadjudication in an arbitration of a sole arbitrator.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">12.              It is thus the petitioner&#x27;s case that now by virtue of the\n\nState Government&#x27;s notification dated 13 October 2016, the State\n\nGovernment has declared it to be its policy, that every Government\n\ncontract which is more than Rs.5 crores shall mandatorily provide for\n\nan arbitration clause. It is stated that by a further notification dated 4\n\nMarch 2017, respondent no.5-Mumbai Centre for International\n\nArbitration, also came to be designated and recognized as an\n\n&#x27;Institutional Arbitration Centre,&#x27; wherein all arbitrations involving the\n\nState/its Undertakings would be conducted. The petitioner in this\n\ncontext makes a reference to an order dated 23 January 2018 of the\n\nlearned Single Judge of this Court in Arbitration Application No.161 of\n\n2017 (R.J.Shah &amp; Co.Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra ) where the parties\n\nagree in proceedings of <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 11</a> of the A&amp;C Act, that the disputes be\n\nreferred for adjudication to the MCIA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">13.

Although such fervent plea is made that an arbitration be\n\nprovided under the agreement in question, it is fairly conceded on\n\nbehalf of the petitioner that the petitioner per se does not have any\n\nclaim against the MSRDC, although the contract had come to an end on\n\n1 February 2017. The petitioner&#x27;s case however is, that the MSRDC by\n\nits letter dated 26 February 2018 had called upon the petitioner to pay\n\nRs.16.86 crores as the petitioner&#x27;s revenue share as per <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 22</a>,\n\nClause no.22.12 (Volume II) of the contract. This based on the\n\ndifference in the traffic count reported by the contractor/petitioner and\n\nthe traffic count undertaken by MSRDC independently. It is stated that\n\ncorrespondence ensued between the parties on this issue and as there\n\nwas disagreement on the accuracy of the traffic data, as per the dispute\n\nresolution clause, as contained in the agreement, a committee\n\ncomprising of the Legal, Accounts and Engineering Division was formed\n\non 18 September 2018. This committee did not accept the objections of\n\nthe petitioner. The petitioner was then called upon to pay the revenue\n\nshare as demanded by the MSRDC. The petitioner contends that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Prashant Rane                                                             11/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">                              - 12 -                      wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\norder passed by the said committee is cryptic and a non-speaking order.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">15.             The petitioner, hence, by its letter dated 18 December 2018,\n\ncalled upon the MSRDC to refer the disputes between the parties to\n\narbitration by invoking the arbitration policy of the State Government\n\nas contained in the notification dated 13 October 2016. The MSRDC\n\nhowever, by its letter dated 17 January 2019 refused the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nrequest to have a reference to arbitration recording that there was no\n\narbitration clause specified, in the contract agreement.

The agreement between the parties was\n\nentered on 5 September 2014. The contract period was from 29 May\n\n2014 to 25 May 2016 which came to be extended upto 22 August 2016\n\nwhen the contractual period came to an end.

It is the petitioner&#x27;s case that MSRDC carried out a traffic\n\nsurvey in April 2015 and in January 2016, for which a consultant came\n\nto be appointed. The survey was for the purpose of revenue sharing\n\nbetween the parties as contained in clause 28.4 of the contract\n\nagreement which inter alia provided that the toll revenue, more than\n\nwhat is projected by the contractor, as per the cash flow submitted by\n\nhim shall be shared with the MSRDC in the ratio 90:10, from the date\n\nof commencement of the contract. The income was required to be\n\ncalculated on the basis of the actual traffic count. The petitioner states\n\nthat based on the traffic count survey report, MSRDC by its letter dated\n\n22 August 2016 called upon the petitioner to remit the revenue share of\n\nRs.33,53,69,108/- to the MSRDC. On receipt of this letter from the\n\nMSRDC, the petitioner requested the MSRDC to furnish a detailed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Prashant Rane                                                                      15/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">                         - 16 -                  wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nworking of the revenue share calculation, which came to be provided by\n\nthe MSRDC by letter dated 21 September 2016. The petitioner\n\nsubmitted to the MSRDC a counter working of the revenue share of\n\nRs.1.39 crores, thereby denying the revenue share of Rs.33.53 crores. A\n\nconsultant-M/s. Darashaw &amp; Company Pvt. Ltd. came to be appointed\n\nby MSRDC who calculated the revised revenue share of Rs.58.76 crores.\n\nAs the parties were not ad-idem on the revenue sharing a committee\n\ncomprising of the Legal, Accounts and Engineering Division, was\n\nformed by the MSRDC to examine the issue of revenue sharing. The\n\ncommittee did not accept the petitioner&#x27;s contention on revenue\n\nsharing, and by a communication dated 18 September 2018 called upon\n\nthe petitioner to pay the MSRDC, the amount of revenue sharing as\n\ncommunicated, alongwith interest. Similar to the case of the petitioner\n\nin the first petition, the petitioner by its letter dated 15 December 2018\n\naddressed to MSRDC, recorded that although there was no arbitration\n\nclause either in the agreement, however as per the policy of the State\n\nGovernment as contained in the notification dated 13 October 2016,\n\nthe dispute on revenue sharing be referred to arbitration. The MSRDC,\n\nhowever, rejected the petitioner&#x27;s request by its letter dated 17 January\n\n2019 which is almost in similar terms as in the first case, inter alia\n\nrecording that there is no arbitration clause specified in the contract\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Prashant Rane                                                            16/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">                              - 17 -                        wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nagreement.

These petitions were heard by a co-ordinate Bench of this\n\nCourt on 18 September 2020, when an adjournment came to be\n\ngranted to the petitioner to enable the petitioner to file an additional\n\naffidavit, to explain as to whether cause of action subsisted for these\n\npetitions to be maintainable. In pursuance of the said order\n\nShri.Shashwat Singh, the common authorised signatory of the\n\npetitioners has placed on record an affidavit dated 25 September 2020\n\nin both these petitions. In his affidavit in the first petition Mr. Shashwat\n\nSingh reiterates that Clause 36.a (supra) is in the nature of an\n\narbitration agreement. He says that although the contract period is over,\n\nthe said clause is required to be recognized as an independent clause\n\nwhich would survive despite the agreement having come to an end.\n\nThe following averments in paragraphs 2(h) and 2(i) are relevant:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                &quot;2h.

The dispute resolution clause is an independent\n                agreement within the entire framework of agreement, and it\n                survives on its own, irrespective of the life of the remaining\n                agreement.

The plea of the petitioner in the second petition is not\n\ndifferent. In paragraph 2(e) of the additional affidavit it is contended\n\nthat the dispute between the parties existed, when the State\n\nGovernment issued the policy notification dated 13 October 2016. It is\n\ncontended that it would be the obligation of the MSRDC to refer the\n\ndisputes to arbitration. Paragraphs 2(e) and 2(j) of the affidavit of\n\nMr.Shashwat Singh read thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                &quot;2(e) That the original Contract period was from 29.05.2014\n                to 25.05.2016 and thereafter extended upto 22.08.2016. After\n                completion of the term, the Toll Plazas were handed over to\n                MSRDC appointed Contractor on 22.08.2018. Therefore till\n                22/08/2018 the Petitioner was running the Toll Plaza.

It is\n\ncontended that the petition does not contain any such assertion. A\n\nmandamus directing the MSDRC to enter into an arbitration agreement\n\ncannot be issued by the Court.               The petitioner, when contends that\n\nthere is an arbitration clause in the agreement which has come to an\n\nend, certainly a writ petition seeking such relief is not maintainable.\n\nThis more so when the agreement in question between the petitioner\n\nand the MSRDC, in both the cases has expired by efflux of time.

This apart, the said policy is only directory\n\nand the corporations and entities like the MSRDC are at liberty to take\n\nappropriate commercial decisions.

The reply affidavits also comment on the terms and\n\nconditions of the agreements and the consequent demand as made by\n\nthe MSRDC on the petitioner, on the revenue sharing. In this context, it\n\nis contended that petitioner had already invoked the dispute resolution\n\nmechanism contained in clause 36 of the contract. In this regard the\n\npetitioner had also sought a hearing before the Vice-Chairman and the\n\nManaging Director (for short the &quot;VC &amp; MD&quot;) of the MSRDC (as per\n\nclause 36) which came to be granted to the petitioner on 8 March 2018.\n\nUpon consideration of the petitioner&#x27;s say the VC &amp; MD observed that\n\nMSRDC constituted a Committee (comprising of legal, accounts and\n\nengineering department personnel) to consider the objections of the\n\npetitioner, the committee had also gone into all the issues as raised by\n\nthe petitioner.    The VC &amp; MD concluded that the objections of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Prashant Rane                                                             20/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_56\">                          - 21 -                   wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\npetitioner were not valid and ultimately by an order dated 18\n\nSeptember 2018 directed the petitioner to immediately pay the revenue\n\nshare alongwith interest thereon to the MSRDC.                The petitioner\n\nhowever failed to make such payment to the MSRDC.                The MSRDC\n\nconsequently by its letter dated 17 March 2020 called upon the\n\npetitioner to pay Rs.25,05,44,219/- as on 31 December 2019 to the\n\nMSRDC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">26.             The MSRDC has contended that there is no arbitration\n\nagreement between the MSRDC and the petitioner, qua the agreements\n\nin    question.   The   petitioner   fully   acknowledging     this    position\n\nnonetheless had sought reference of the disputes to arbitration which\n\ncame to be rejected by MSRDC. It is contended that the writ petitions\n\nare thoroughly misconceived in as much as arbitration is a voluntary\n\nexercise which requires consent of the parties to be bound by the\n\ndecision of the arbitral tribunal. It is contended in the present context,\n\nit was MSRDC&#x27;s discretion whether to agree for arbitration for redressal\n\nof the MSRDC&#x27;s claim. It is contended that it is settled law that the\n\nHigh Court would not issue a writ of mandamus in regard to an issue\n\nwhich is plainly the subject matter of the voluntary desire and will of\n\nthe contracting parties. It is contended that the petitioner does not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Prashant Rane                                                              21/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">                           - 22 -                 wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nhave any right, either contractual or statutory, to force the MSRDC to\n\nraise its claim against the petitioner only in arbitration proceedings.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_60\">27.             It is next contended by the MSRDC that the petitioner&#x27;s\n\ncase based on the State Government policy to have an &quot;institutional\n\narbitration&quot; is completely misplaced. It is contended that the policy\n\nitself is not mandatory and is directory in nature. It is contended that\n\nin any case, as per the said policy, all existing contracts qualifying the\n\ncriteria as prescribed in the Government Resolution are required to be\n\nsuitably amended only after obtaining consent of the other parties, to\n\ninclude the model/standard arbitration clause.       It is stated that the\n\npolicy eschews ad-hoc arbitration and mandates that disputes in all the\n\ncases as may be provided in the policy shall be referred to institutional\n\narbitration at the recognized arbitration centre for which the MCIA has\n\nbeen recognised as an arbitration centre. It is contended that the policy\n\ndoes not mandate any resort to institutional arbitration in cases where\n\nthe contract stands determined. MSRDC says that in the present cases,\n\nthe agreements stood determined by efflux of time and the toll plazas\n\nwere handed over by the petitioner to the contractor appointed by the\n\nMSRDC on the said date. It is thus contended that the policy does not\n\napply to the contracts which have come to an end, as the policy itself\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Prashant Rane                                                             22/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">                            - 23 -                  wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\ncame into force on 13 October 2016. This apart at no point of time\n\nduring the subsistence of the said agreement, did the petitioner ever\n\nrequest the MSRDC to amend the said agreement in order to include a\n\nsuitable arbitration clause. The MSRDC is not obliged to agree for any\n\narbitration. It is next contended that the issue of the MSRDC entering\n\ninto an arbitration agreement with the petitioner is purely a contractual\n\nissue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">28.             It is contended by the MSRDC that it is settled law that this\n\nCourt in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n\nwould not interfere in contractual matters. It is contended that in any\n\nevent clause 36 of the contract as referred by the petitioner does not\n\nconstitute an arbitration agreement under <a href=\"/doc/1846895/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 7</a> of the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996.         A relief as prayed in the petition is\n\ncertainly a relief to alter the agreement/contract which tantamounts to\n\ninviting the Court&#x27;s interference in contractual matters. It is contended\n\nthat in the first petition ex-facie prayer clauses (a) and (b) are contrary\n\nto each other. On one hand, in prayer (a) the petitioner seeks an order\n\ndirecting the MSRDC to take recourse to institutional arbitration\n\npurportedly invoking the said State policy. On the other hand, prayer\n\nclause (b) has the effect of directing MSRDC to adopt an arbitration\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Prashant Rane                                                               23/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">                               - 24 -                  wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nbefore the VC &amp; MD of the MSRDC, which is contrary to the policy as\n\nalso to the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_9\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, hence, both the\n\nprayers as made by the petitioner are not maintainable.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_65\">29.             MSRDC says that it is clear from the facts that the petitioners\n\ncase is not of any claim it has against the MSRDC but possibly on a\n\nclaim which the MSRDC is making against the petitioner for amounts\n\nrecoverable on the revenue sharing. Hence, the writ petition does not\n\ndisclose any cause of action for the petitioner even to invoke arbitration\n\nmuch less file this petition. The petitioner therefore has neither filed\n\nany legal proceeding against the MSRDC, nor disclosed any claim\n\nagainst the MSRDC requiring arbitration. It is next contended that if it\n\nis the petitioner&#x27;s contention that clause 36 of the contract/agreement\n\n(supra) is required to be construed as an arbitration agreement, then\n\nthere was no question of filing these writ petitions seeking directions to\n\namend the contract/agreement between the parties to provide for\n\narbitration. The remedy of the petitioner in that case was to adopt\n\nappropriate proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_10\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996</a>. It is contended that in any event the dispute resolution procedure\n\nprovided in clause 36 of the agreement is already exhausted by the\n\npetitioner. The petitioner had invoked clause 36 and participated in a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Prashant Rane                                                                  24/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">                          - 25 -                   wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nhearing before the VC &amp; MD and even in the meetings of the committee\n\n(of legal, accounts and engineering department of the MSRDC), formed\n\nto discuss and resolve the issues of calculation of revenue share as per\n\nthe VC &amp; MD&#x27;s directions. This culminated into a decision/order dated\n\n18 September 2018 of the VC &amp; MD. If the petitioner was dissatisfied\n\nby the said decision of the VC &amp; MD, the remedy for the petitioner was\n\nto take recourse to     appropriate proceedings.      After exhausting the\n\nremedy under the said clause under the agreement, it was not open for\n\nthe petitioner to approach this court in the present proceedings as also\n\nto contend that clause 36 is an arbitration agreement. Accordingly, it is\n\nprayed that for these reasons, the petition deserves to be dismissed with\n\ncosts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">30.             Shri. Shankarrao Jagtap in his reply affidavit filed in the\n\nsecond petition, has raised similar contentions inter-alia stating that it is\n\nthe MSRDC who by its letter dated 2 December 2017, had called upon\n\nthe petitioner to pay Rs.58.76 Crores along with interest from 22\n\nAugust 2016. It is MSRDC&#x27;s case that the VC &amp; MD were called upon\n\nby the petitioner to resolve the issues in regard to the MSRDC&#x27;s demand\n\nas agreed in clause 39 of the offer document. It is contended that this\n\nrequest was acted upon by the VC &amp; MD by granting a hearing to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Prashant Rane                                                              25/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_69\">                          - 26 -                  wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\npetitioner on the issues of methodology for calculation pertaining to\n\nrevenue share. The VC &amp; MD finally passed an order directing the\n\npetitioner to immediately pay the revenue share along with interest\n\nthereon to the MSRDC. The petitioner failed to make payment of the\n\nrequisite amount. It is contended that it is MSRDC which has a claim of\n\nRs.82,79,93,261.00 against the petitioner towards unpaid toll revenue\n\nshare in terms of clause 28.4 of the offer document for which a demand\n\nwas raised on the petitioner again on 20 January 2020.              The bank\n\nguarantees were also encashed by the MSRDC. There is no question of\n\nany arbitration between the parties as there is no such agreement\n\nbetween the MSRDC and the petitioner. Despite this clear position the\n\npetitioner called upon the MSRDC to refer the dispute to arbitration,\n\nwhich was rightly rejected by the MSRDC by its letter dated 17 January\n\n2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">31.

Dr. Singhvi would submit that   the MSRDC is not correct\n\nin its contention that the policy as contained in the Government\n\nResolution dated 13 October 2016 providing for reference of disputes to\n\ninstitutional arbitration would not be applicable to the agreements in\n\nquestion. According to him the State&#x27;s policy clearly envisages that the\n\nState Government and/or its instrumentalities make a provision for\n\ninstitutional arbitration, in contracts entered with private parties.

It is next submitted that it is obligatory for the MSRDC to\n\nimplement the State policy even for those contracts which stood\n\nterminated by efflux of time when the petitioner itself is ready ad\n\nwilling for arbitration. There is no question of the MSRDC contending,\n\nthat it has a discretion not to opt for arbitration as a dispute resolution\n\nmechanism, once it is made mandatory by the said Government\n\nnotification, to refer disputes to arbitration under the institutional\n\nmechanism.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">35.             The petitioner is entitled to seek implementation and\n\neffectuation of the State policy unless the policy was hit by any of the\n\nprinciples as laid down by the Supreme Court in Tata Cellular. A larger\n\nand holistic view point is required to be taken, as policy is not to cover\n\nindividual cases, but is required to be applied in all appropriate cases.\n\nBoth these cases are appropriate cases for the policy to be implemented\n\nand the disputes to be referred for institutional arbitration. There is no\n\nstrong comprehensive reason not to refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Prashant Rane                                                              28/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">                                  - 29 -              wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nThe MSRDC has no answer to any of these issues as raised by the\n\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">36.

It is\n\nsubmitted that the contentions of the MSRDC are wholly contrary to\n\nthe clear intent of the policy. There cannot be a discriminatory and\n\nselective policy when it comes to the State entering into contract on\n\nthe dispute resolution mechanism. Once a policy is formulated, it is\n\nrequired to be given effect in all contracts existing or otherwise.       The\n\nlegislative policy as contained in the enactments like <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_15\">Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act</a> 1996, <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_16\">Code of Civil Procedure</a>, as also the notification\n\ndated 13 October 2016 leans heavily in favour of arbitration rather than\n\ncompelling a party to approach the Civil Court.

It is for\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Prashant Rane                                                            32/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_99\">                             - 33 -              wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nthis reason that the petitioner has demanded arbitration as per the\n\npolicy decision and in terms of their specific demand qua the contracts,\n\nsubject matter of the present proceedings. There is hence a valid claim\n\nof each of the petitioner that said demand ought to be struck down and\n\ndamages be awarded to the petitioner for breach of contract. These are\n\nthe disputes which are required to be adjudicated by referring the\n\ndisputes to institutional arbitration as per the State policy as contained\n\nin the said notification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">43.             We may at the outset note some of the admitted facets of\n\nthe petitioner&#x27;s case. The contracts in question in both the cases were\n\nconcluded contracts, they stand fully executed. The contract period in\n\nthe first case came to an end on 1 February 2017 and in the second case\n\ncame to an end on 22 August 2016. During the subsistence of both\n\nthese contracts, the petitioners never insisted for any amendment\n\nand/or modification of the terms of the contract so as to request the\n\nMSRDC to provide for arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. It\n\nis also an admitted position that both the petitioners, by itself have not\n\nraised any claim against MSRDC under these contracts. Hence,\n\nconcededly the petitioners have no claim whatsoever against the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Prashant Rane                                                            33/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">                           - 34 -                wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nMSRDC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_104\">44.             It is further an admitted position that the MSRDC acting\n\nunder the contractual terms post the contract period, has raised an\n\nissue in regard to revenue sharing on the basis of traffic figures as\n\ncollected by it, by appointing an expert agency and considering the\n\nfigures which the petitioners-contractors had furnished. On the basis of\n\nsuch materials MSRDC has raised a demand on both these petitioners.\n\nBoth the contracts provided for dispute resolution mechanism under\n\nwhich the VC &amp;MD was the authority who would consider any such\n\nissue arising between the parties, in a manner as agreed, and take a\n\ndecision which is to attain finality. In both these contracts, the\n\npetitioners invoked the said mechanism in regard to the amounts as\n\ndemanded by the MSRDC, on the revenue sharing. As noted above the\n\nVC&amp;MD appointed a committee of Legal, Accounts and Engineering\n\nDivision and on the basis of the report of the committee, a demand was\n\nraised on the petitioners on the revenue sharing. It is thus evident, that\n\nit is the MSRDC which has a claim against the petitioners, for which\n\nMSRDC has not so far initiated proceedings as may be permissible\n\nunder the contractual relations in which the parties stood. When the\n\npetitioners having no claim against the MSRDC approached the MSRDC\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Prashant Rane                                                            34/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">                             - 35 -                 wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nwith a request that an arbitral tribunal be appointed to adjudicate any\n\ndispute, the MSRDC rejected the said request of the petitioners saying\n\nthat the contracts do not provide for any arbitration agreement.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">45.             It is not the case of the petitioners that such a reply or\n\ncommunication of the MSRDC is alien to the contract, despite this, the\n\npetitioners pray that an arbitration mechanism now be provided, by\n\ntaking recourse to the Government Policy as contained in the\n\nNotification dated 13 October 2016. Admittedly, such a request was\n\ncompletely falling outside the contractual conditions as agreed between\n\nthe parties. In other words, it is a prayer of the petitioners that an\n\nadditional condition in the contract be incorporated/ created under the\n\norders of this Court, namely to make a provision for institutional\n\narbitration between the parties, in respect of both these agreements and\n\nthat too when these agreements stand determined by efflux of time.\n\nSuch case of the petitioner is based on the following premise:-\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(i)               That the State Government has a policy in its notification\n\ndated 13 October 2016 to provide for institutional arbitration in the\n\ncontracts which would be entered by the State Government and its\n\nagencies.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Prashant Rane                                                               35/56</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">                            - 36 -                  wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\n\n\n\n(ii)            That Clause no.36.a (in the first petition) is an arbitration\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">agreement between the parties and which ought to be given effect.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(iii)           As regards the Second petition, only on the basis of the\n\nState Government Policy as contained in the Notification dated 13\n\nOctober 2016 arbitration between the parties ought to be provided.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">46.             Before we proceed to examine the petitioners case, at the\n\noutset we may note that there is nothing shown to us, that under the\n\nrespective agreements the parties have agreed to be bound by any\n\nfuture policy of the State government in this context. Nevertheless, to\n\nappreciate the petitioners case, it can be examined as to what is the\n\npolicy of the State Government as contained in the notification dated\n\n13 October 2016.         The Government Notification dated 13 October\n\n2016, in the introductory paragraph records that it is to reduce the\n\nexpenditure on litigation and to have speedy resolution of disputes, the\n\nState Government in pursuance of the decision taken in the committee\n\nof Ministers, has approved an institutional arbitration policy as\n\ncontained in Annexure A of the said Government Resolution. Annexure\n\nA provides for policy of arbitration as a preferred mode of dispute\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Prashant Rane                                                               36/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">                                  - 37 -                       wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nresolution. The policy also refers to 246th Report of the Law Commission\n\nof India, in regard to the slow speed of institutional arbitration in India,\n\nexcept its working in the Delhi High Court International Arbitration\n\nCentre (since 2009), the Punjab and Haryana High Court Arbitration\n\nCentre (since 2014) and the Indian Council of Arbitration in co-\n\nordination with FICCI and Nani Palkhiwala Arbitration Centre, in\n\nChennai.            It speaks of establishment of an institutional arbitration\n\ncentre at Mumbai.

In one matter, there is a\n                       procedure to give award by the Govt. Officers whereas in\n                       another matter, the Govt. Officers are the arbitrators.

The policy initiatives are therefore aimed to promote\n\ninstitutional arbitration and to provide for a uniform regime for\n\nresolution of disputes through arbitration so that a standard\n\ninstitutional arbitration clause be provided in the contracts entered by\n\nthe State Government or its bodies where commercial value of the\n\ncontract is Rs.5 crores. However, what is significant is as to what is\n\nprovided in clause (iv)(supra) that only with the consent of the parties\n\nto the contract/agreement, the existing agreement and / or contract can\n\nbe suitably amended or            altered to provide for a dispute resolution\n\nmechanism for referring the disputes to an Indian Arbitration Institute.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Prashant Rane                                                                         38/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">                            - 39 -                  wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nIt is thus not a policy of the State Government that it would mandate\n\ncompulsory imposition of an arbitration agreement, qua the existing\n\ncontracts so as to automatically amend such contracts as entered\n\nbetween the parties, by such executive fiat. This cannot be done in law.\n\nIn our opinion, the contracting freedom and the free consent of the\n\nparties, to have mutually agreed terms in a contract is in no manner\n\ndisturbed, when this policy recognizes that only with the consent of the\n\nother parties namely the contractors the existing agreement can be\n\nchanged.

The petitioner, however, wants us to read clause (iv) of the\n\npolicy initiatives to mean that institutional arbitration perforce has\n\nbecome binding and mandatory qua the contracts in question when the\n\n&quot;other parties to the contract&quot; namely the contractor (petitioners)\n\nthemselves have agreed for providing for arbitration as mode of dispute\n\nresolution. We are afraid that this contention as urged on behalf of the\n\npetitioner not only militates against the basic tenets of a valid and a\n\nlegal contract well recognized not only under the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_18\">Indian Contract Act</a>\n\nbut also under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_19\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a>.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Prashant Rane                                                               39/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">                                 - 40 -                      wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">49.

A writ would not be issued by the court to incorporate and /\n\nor introduce a new term and condition in a contract executed between\n\nthe parties. The petitioner even at the stage of entering into a contract\n\ncould not have sought interference of this Court to adjudicate as to how\n\nthe terms and conditions of the contract would be framed.

If such interference is made, it\n\nwould amount to this Court sitting in appeal over the contractual\n\nfreedom exercised by the MSRDC.           Further more the Court by\n\nexercising writ jurisdiction cannot re-write or vary the terms and\n\nconditions of the contract. Once the contract was entered between the\n\nparties, the parties being governed by the terms and conditions of the\n\ncontract, would be the normal rule. There is nothing exceptional in the\n\npresent case which would require a judicial review of the contractual\n\nposition taken by the parties. This, more particularly when the parties\n\nhave acted under the contract and the contractual period having\n\nalready come to an end.

It is axiomatic that having enunciated a\n                policy of general application and having communicated to it\n                all concerned including the Chandigarh engineering college,\n                the Administration is bound by it.

The case of the petitioners in the\n\npresent petitions is effectively to call upon this Court to provide for an\n\narbitration between the parties by applying the said policy of the State\n\nGovernment, which is nothing short of the petitioner calling upon the\n\nCourt to amend the agreements of the petitioners as entered with the\n\nMSRDC.          Similarly in <a href=\"/doc/25810360/\" id=\"a_48\">Raja Shri Shivrai Pratishthan vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra &amp; Ors.</a> (supra), the challenge before the Supreme Court\n\narose from a decision of the High Court which had dismissed a writ\n\npetition filed by the appellants questioning Government Resolution\n\ndated 20 April 2002, whereby names of the appellants were excluded\n\nfrom the list of institutions selected for running Vruddhashrams on non-\n\ngrant-aid basis.       A policy decision was taken by the Government of\n\nMaharashtra to establish homes for senior citizens under the Matoshree\n\nVruddhashram Scheme. In 1995, rules came to be framed for providing</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Prashant Rane                                                                       52/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_153\">                                - 53 -                     wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\ngrant-in-aid to recognized Vruddhashrams. After six years, the State\n\nGovernment reviewed its decision and issued a fresh Resolution dated 3\n\nDecember, 2001 for conducting Vruddhashrams through private\n\nvoluntary institutions on permanent non-grant-aid basis.                       Pursuant\n\nthereto, advertisements were issued by the Director, Social Welfare by\n\ninviting proposals for conducting Vruddhashrams on non-grant-aid\n\nbasis.          The appellant was one of the applicants under the said\n\nadvertisement.            The private respondents submitted applications for\n\nbeing selected for running Vruddhashrams. Thereafter by a Resolution\n\ndated 20 April, 2002, the government notified listing of institutions\n\nselected for conducting Vruddhashrams on non-grant-aid basis. The\n\nnames of the appellants did not figure in that list. Instead, the private\n\nrespondents were shown as the institutions selected for running\n\nVruddhashrams at Pune and Kolhapur respectively. The petitioner in\n\nthese circumstances challenged the Government Resolution dated 20\n\nApril,      2002     to    contend      that   their   non-selection     for   running\n\nVruddhashrams on non-grant-aid basis was wholly arbitrary.                           The\n\nappellants&#x27; challenge before the High Court failed, as the High Court\n\nheld that the allotment of Vruddhashrams on grant-in-aid basis did not\n\ncreate any vested right in favour of the appellants and that the\n\nappellants cannot complain against the revised policy decision or claim\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">Prashant Rane                                                                      53/56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">                                - 54 -                      wp1699-2337-19reserved-final.doc\n\nthat they should have been heard before rejection of their applications.\n\nIt is in this context the Supreme Court in paragraph 17 made the\n\nfollowing observations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">          &quot;17. .................. Once the Government laid down the policy\n          for selection, the same was binding on all its functionaries including\n          the Director, Social Welfare and the applications of the appellants\n          could not have been indirectly rejected without any rhyme or\n          reason.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">It is difficult for us to accept petitioners reliance on this decision in the\n\npresent facts.
