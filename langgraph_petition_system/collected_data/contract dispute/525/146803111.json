By way of this common judgment, I propose to decide the two sets of\nobjections filed by the same petitioner against different respondents. The\nfacts and legal points in both the matters are common, therefore, both the\npetitions are being decided together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">2.     OMP No.1003/2013 has been filed under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Act&quot;) challenging\nthe Award dated 1st June, 2013 (though pronounced on 9th May, 2013)\npassed by the Arbitral Tribunal with respect to dispute arising out of\npayment of price adjustment in accordance with the Note prescribed under\nsub-Clause 70.3 (c)(xi) of the Conditions of Particular Application\n(hereinafter referred to as the &quot;COPA&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.     Brief facts of the case as per pleadings of the parties are that:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> (i)   The tenders were called for the work of &quot;Four Laning from KM.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">       480.000 to KM. 520.000 of Gopalganj - Muzaffarpur section of NH-28\n       in Bihar&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;work&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\"> (ii) The respondent/Contractor submitted its bid to the petitioner/ Employer\n       on 23rd May, 2005. After scrutiny of the bids of all the competing\n       contractors, the bid of the respondent was found to be the most\n       competitive and accordingly, a letter of acceptance was issued by the\n       petitioner to the respondent on 8th July, 2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\"> (iii) In view of the same, a contract agreement being Contract Package\n       No.LMNHP-EW-II-(WB)-12 was formally executed between the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                            Page 2 of 27</span>\n        petitioner and the respondent for execution of the work for a contract\n       price of Rs.311,13,26,068/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\"> (iv) The work was to be carried out as per the Bill of Quantities (hereinafter\n       referred to as the &#x27;BOQ&#x27;) read in conjunction with conditions of contract,\n       specifications, drawings and other documents forming part of the\n       contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"> (v) As per the respondent, it had initiated execution of the work entrusted to\n       it. During the execution of the work, a certain dispute arose between the\n       parties which was subsequently referred to arbitration, in terms of the\n       provisions of the contract, to a three-member Arbitral Tribunal\n       constituted by the parties for the said purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\"> (vi) The resulting Award of the Arbitral Tribunal dated 1st June, 2013 is the\n       subject matter of challenge in the present petition filed by the petitioner\n       under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 34</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">4.     Learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon the judgment of\nthe learned Single Judge in NHAI v. BSCPL, reported as 2015(1) Arb. LR\n129 and the judgment dated 10th March, 2015 of the Division Bench of this\nCourt in NHAI v M/s. NCC-VEE (JV), FAO(OS) No.93/2015 stating the\nissue and interpretation of the clause required in the present case is pari\nmateria and, therefore, there is no requirement of adjudication in the present\npetition. It is a covered matter. The judgment of the Single Bench has\nattained finality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.     Learned counsel for the petitioner, on the other hand, submitted that\nthe said contention is not correct which is against the terms of the contract.\nThe Court has to examine the conduct of the parties for more than 9 interim\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                         Page 3 of 27</span>\n payment certificates (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>) which was at ad idem with regard to the payment\nof the price escalation in terms of Sub Clause 70.3 (c)(xi). Furthermore, the\nclause in BSCPL (supra) was entirely different and distinct from the clause\nin the present case, and the Note in BSCPL has been reproduced herein\nbelow:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       &quot;Note: X, Y, Z are the actual percentage of cost of materials of\n       bitumen, cement and steel respectively used for execution of\n       work as per the Interim Payment certificate for the month.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">6.     In order to distinguish the present case with the case of BSCPL\n(supra), the Note was interpreted on the basis of the term &quot;cost&quot; which has\nbeen defined in Clause 1.1 (g) (i) of the General Conditions of Contract. In\nfact, the learned Single Judge in para 21 clearly records that the Arbitral\nTribunal rejected the contention with regard to engagement of base cost\nprevailing 28 days prior to the bid due date on the basis of definition of the\ncost expressly defined in the contract. (The said aspect that in the Award,\ninterpretation of Note was only done on the basis of cost, is also reflective\nfrom paras 8 &amp; 9 of the judgment dated 10th March, 2015 passed by the\nDivision Bench in FAO(OS) No.93/2015.)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">7.     In BSCPL (supra), the NHAI till 18 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>s was also making payment\non the basis of current cost as against the stand put forth before the Arbitral\nTribunal therein that the price escalation has to be paid on the basis of base\ncost prevailing 28 days prior to the date of the bid. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1780900\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"737188\" id=\"span_5\">Only the basis of the\nconduct of the NHAI in making payment of price escalation on the basis of\nthe current cost, the Arbitral Award after applying the findings of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/737188/\" id=\"a_5\">Godhra Electricity Co. Ltd. &amp; Anr. v. State of Gujarat</a>,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                       Page 4 of 27</span>\n reported as (<a href=\"/doc/1780900/\" id=\"a_6\">1975) 1 SCC 199 and Abdulla Ahmed v Animendra Kissen\nMitter</a>, reported as AIR 1950 SC 15, has passed the Award in the said\nmatter, which has attained the finality between the parties.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">8.     The contractual clauses in the present case as well as the facts are\nentirely distinguishable as there is no reference of cost in the Note\nconcerning the present matter. But, the Arbitral Tribunal suo moto read\n&quot;cost&quot; in the Note of which interpretation was sought to arrive at the\nconclusion that for calculating the actual percentage of material, the current\ncost is required to be engaged and it is settled law that interpretation of the\nterms of the contract fall within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator and any\nerror while so interpreting is not amenable to correction under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 34</a> of\nthe Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">9.     The question which arises in the present case as submitted by the\ncounsel for the petitioner is that while interpreting the terms of the contract,\nwhich in itself are unequivocal and unambiguous, is the Arbitral Tribunal\npermitted to introduce words which are conspicuously missing. The Arbitral\nTribunal is bound to interpret the terms of the contract as it is and not what it\nshould have been.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">10.    It is canvassed by the learned counsel for the petitioner that once the\nArbitral Tribunal arrived at a conclusion that the contract did not indicate the\nadoption of the fixed base rates, and at the same time, the contract also did\nnot indicate adoption of the current rates, the only course available to the\nArbitral Tribunal was bound to resort the salutary principle of deciphering\nthe intention of the parties from the conduct adopted by them shortly after\nthe date of instrument and during the performance of the contract.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                        Page 5 of 27</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\"> 11.    In the present case, it is submitted by the petitioner that the Arbitral\nTribunal did not even address the preliminary objection by the petitioner that\nthe claim was not maintainable being barred by the principle of estoppel as it\nwas an admitted fact that for the first nine <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>s, the contractor itself was\nraising its bill as per the correct interpretation of the relevant terms and\nconditions of the contract, and it was only after much water had flown down\nthe bridge that the contractor for the first time changed its stand and started\ndemanding payment of price escalation on current rates, rather than the BOQ\nrates or the rates prevailing 28 days prior to the bid. There is no adjudication\non the aspect of the conduct of the Contractor submitting <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a>s after\ncalculating the variables on rates prevailing 28 days prior to the bid. Even\notherwise, the Note refers to the actual percentages of material of bitumen,\ncement and steel respectively used for execution of work as per the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a> for\nthe month. For calculating the percentage, the denominator in the equation\ninsofar as the value of the work done in particular <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">IPC</a> is on the BOQ rates\nand therefore, as per the settled mathematical principles, the numerator\nwould also be based upon the BOQ rates. In case the numerator is derived\nfrom the current rates, whilst the denominator is worked out at BOQ rates, it\nwould lead to absurd consequences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">12.    It is submitted that as the Arbitral Tribunal failed to appreciate that the\nprice adjustment formula was devised to capture escalation, and once the\ncurrent cost of material is taken into account, there was no requirement of\nany further escalation, and escalation over and above the current cost would\namount to unjust enrichment. Therefore, the interpretation arrived at by the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                         Page 6 of 27</span>\n Arbitral Tribunal is, on the face of it, unreasonable and unfair and the Award\nis liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">13.    Lastly, it is alleged with regard to reliance placed by the counsel for\nthe petitioner on the judgment dated 22nd October, 2013 in O.M.P.\nNo.1043/2013 titled as NHAI v. M/s KMC-RK-SD (JV) which has\napplication to the facts of the present case, as in the present case is not one of\nmisinterpretation of the terms of the contract, but where by introduction of\nthe term of cost in the Note, the Arbitral Tribunal has in a way rewritten the\ncontractual arrangement, which is not permissible in law. Furthermore, here\nis not the case where an objection was to be raised by the Contractor on an\nopinion/calculation by the Engineer. Rather, in the present case, the\ncontractor itself was calculating the variables X, Y, Z on the basis of cost\nprevailing 28 days prior to the bid and submitting its <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">IPC</a>s, which was\naccepted by the Engineer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">14.    The petitioner has also filed the objections by way of OMP\nNo.54/2015 under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1153621/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 16(6)</a> of the Act for setting\naside the Arbitral Award dated 28th August, 2014 as received by the\npetitioner on 1st September, 2014 and modification in the Award dated 29th\nAugust, 2014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">       The petitioner has deposited an amount of Rs.20,88,52,283/- before\nthis Court in view of order passed on 21st December, 2015 as part of the\nClaim No.1 raised in another matter which was challenged by the petitioner\nhas been dismissed in the Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition filed by\nthe petitioner.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                         Page 7 of 27</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">        With regard to the facts and challenge to the Award dated 28th August,\n2014 as the legal points are similar to another matter which is the subject\nmatter of OMP.No.1003/2013, similar contentions were raised by both the\nparties in this matter also pertaining to Claim No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">       As far as Claim No.2 pertaining to the payment of additional costs/\nlosses suffered due to being prevented from executing the work as planned is\nconcerned, learned counsel for the respondent submits that the objections\nraised against this claim are also liable to be dismissed in view of dismissal\nof OMP No.633/2012, NHAI v.

There is no merit in the\nsubmissions of the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">15.    It is mentioned that there was no arguments addressed by the counsel\nfor the petitioner on Claims No.2 during the hearing. The Claim No.1 of the\nConcessionaire is regarding adjustment of Contract Price in terms of sub-\nClause 70.3 of COPA for variation in rates/prices of Cement, Steel, Bitumen\nand other materials over the rates/prices of these commodities prevailing in\nthe previous month prior to the closing date for submission of bids for the\nproject. In support of objections filed, learned counsel for the petitioner has\nreferred an order of the Arbitral Tribunal in another matter comprising of\nSh.O.P.Goel, Sh.S.P.Singh and Sh.P.C.Sharma in the matter of M/s.\nSsangyong Engineering &amp; Construction Co.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has addressed the similar\nsubmissions as argued by the counsel for the petitioner in O.M.P.\nNo.1003/2013. It is an issue of interpretation of clause 70.3 of the contract\nwhich is the same issue in the connected matter. The facts and details of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                       Page 9 of 27</span>\n evidence and documents are referred in the impugned Award. Since the\nissue in the present case is identical as involved in OMP No.1003/2013, both\nthe matters are decided by single judgment. The facts are taken from OMP\nNo.1003/2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">17.    The issue in hand is mainly pertaining to interpretation of a\ncontractual clause by the Arbitral Tribunal, as the dispute arose between the\nparties regarding the true meaning and interpretation of the price adjustment\nformula contained in the contract, namely Clause 70.3 of the COPA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">       The extract of relevant part of the Clause, which fell for interpretation\nby the Arbitral Tribunal, is sub-Clause 70.3(xi) and the Note appended\nbelow the said sub-Clause has been reproduced here as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;xi.

It is not in dispute that the contract does not stipulate specifically,\nhowever, the Arbitral Tribunal held that a plain reading of the &#x27;Note&#x27; below\nsub-Clause 70.3(xi) does not by any means indicate or even imply that the\ncost of a material on a date 28 days prior to the submission of bids is\nintended to be taken into account for calculating the X, Y, Z percentages.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">21.    In earlier orders passed by the predecessor Bench on 10th March, 2015\nand 15th April, 2015, it has been recorded that a similar issue concerning the\npetitioner had been adjudicated upon by a Single Judge of this Court in the\ncase titled NHAI v. BSCPL (supra) and the same has been upheld by a\nDivision Bench of this Court by order dated 10 th March, 2015 in FAO (OS)\nNo.93/2015 (supra).\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                        Page 11 of 27</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"> 22.    One of the main arguments of the petitioner is that it is the base cost\nthat is to be utilized for calculating the X, Y, Z, percentages in the price\nadjustment formula which had been rejected by this Court in the aforesaid\ndecisions, however, it is not in dispute by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the order of the Division Bench has attained finality as in-\nlimine the petitioner&#x27;s challenge has been rejected by the Supreme Court in\nSpecial Leave Petition Nos.19526/2015 &amp; 19645/2015 filed by the petitioner\non 31st August, 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">23.    No doubt, during hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner has\ntried to distinguish the facts of the present case with the case of BSCPL\n(supra), mainly, on the reason that there is a slight difference in the relevant\nprice adjustment clause that was in issue before the Court in the BSCPL\n(supra) case and the price adjustment clause that has been interpreted by the\nArbitral Tribunal in the present case. It is also contended that in fact, the\njudgment of the Single Judge in the BSCPL (supra) case supports the case of\nthe petitioner in the present case, as the respondent in the present case had\ninitially raised certain <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">IPC</a> as per the interpretation of the petitioner/NHAI\nand later resiled from the same in subsequent bills, therefore, the said factor\nhad persuaded the Single Judge to uphold the claim of the contractor in the\nBSCPL case (supra) was on account of the petitioner having itself sanctioned\nbills for a long period of time as per the contractor&#x27;s interpretation, whereas\nthe position in the present case is just the opposite, in view of such difference\nin the price adjustment clause considered by this Court in the BSCPL case\n(supra) as compared to the price adjustment clause in the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">24.

The Division Bench, while upholding the findings of the Arbitral\nTribunal in the BSCPL case analyzed the clause as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       &quot;4. From the above sub para (xi) it is evident that\n       percentages ascribed to labor, plant, machinery and spares and\n       POL are constant (fixed). Insofar as bitumen, cement and steel\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                       Page 13 of 27</span>\n        are concerned, the percentages are variable and have been\n       depicted as X %, Y % and Z %. Insofar as other materials are\n       concerned, the formula prescribed is 50 - (X+Y+Z)%. The total\n       of all components is 100%. It is evident that the percentage of\n       other materials is a balancing item. Therefore, it may be\n       positive and it can also be negative. This is so, because the total\n       must always be 100%.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       5.     Insofar as &#x27;X&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27; and &#x27;Z&#x27; are concerned the Note\n       appended to sub-para (xi) stipulates that they are the actual\n       percentages of cost of bitumen, cement and steel respectively,\n       used for execution of work, as per the interim payment\n       certificate for the month.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       6.     The entire controversy in the present case relates to the\n       meaning of the expression &#x27;cost&#x27; of bitumen, cement and steel.\n       According to the learned counsel for the appellant the\n       expression &#x27;cost&#x27; denotes the quantity of bitumen, cement and\n       steel used in a particular month multiplied by the base rate (i.e.\n       the rate prevailing 28 days prior to the submission of the bid).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       7.     On the other hand, the contention raised by the\n       respondent is that the expression &#x27;cost&#x27; refers to the quantity of\n       the bitumen, cement and steel used during a particular month\n       multiplied by the prevailing rate in that month. This is the\n       limited scope of the controversy in this case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       8.     The Arbitral Tribunal has examined this aspect of the\n       matter in detail in paragraphs 57 to 85 of the Award. The\n       Arbitral Tribunal concluded that a plain reading of the Note\n       below sub clause 70.3(xi) does not suggest that the cost of\n       bitumen, cement and steel mentioned therein, has to be\n       considered as the cost of these materials prevailing 28 days\n       prior to the last date of submission of the bid. It was further\n       concluded that on a joint reading of the relevant clauses and sub\n       clauses, it was clear that the cost of bitumen, cement and steel\n       to be considered in the said Note was the actual/current cost and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                        Page 14 of 27</span>\n        that contract does not mention that the definition of cost of this\n       particular sub clause had to be understood differently.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       9.     We may also point out that in the general conditions of\n       contract, Clause 1.1 (g) (i) defines &#x27;The cost&#x27; to mean\n       expenditure properly incurred or to be incurred, whether on or\n       off the site including over and above charges properly allocated\n       thereto and does not include any allowance of profit. The said\n       definition does not refer to any base cost as the appellant wants\n       us to interpret the said Note.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       10. We have also examined the judgment of the learned\n       Single Judge. We find that the interpretation given by the\n       Arbitral Tribunal is not an impossible view. Although, there\n       may be some substance, in what the learned counsel for the\n       appellant submits by way of interpretation of the said Note, but\n       that would only be one of the possible interpretations. Another\n       possible interpretation is the one adopted by the Arbitral\n       Tribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">27.    Counsel for the respondents in both the matters submits that from the\nearlier decisions passed by this court which have attained finality by the\nSupreme Court, it is evident that the dispute in the BSCPL case (supra) was\nas to whether the &#x27;base cost&#x27; was required to be used or the &#x27;current cost&#x27;. The\ndifference in the &#x27;Note&#x27; in the price adjustment clause before the Division\nBench in the BSCPL case (supra) and the &#x27;Note&#x27; in the price adjustment\nclause that was considered by the Arbitral Tribunal in the present case i.e.\n&#x27;actual percentage of cost&#x27; as compared to &#x27;actual percentage&#x27; would not\namount to a material difference for the reason that the parties are ad-idem in\nthe present case as well as that the &#x27;actual percentage&#x27; is to be arrived at by\nthe usage of the correct &#x27;cost&#x27; or &#x27;rate&#x27; of the elements of X, Y and Z\nrespectively.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                       Page 15 of 27</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\"> 28.    The stand of the respondent is that while computing the percentage of\nthe components of X, Y and Z i.e. bitumen, cement and steel respectively,\nthe percentage has to be calculated by multiplying the quantities of these\nitems in a bill for that particular month, with the &#x27;current cost&#x27; or landed cost\nof these items in the market. The stand of the petitioner on the other hand is\nthat while computing the percentage of the components of X, Y and Z the\npercentage has to be calculated by multiplying the quantities of these items\nin a bill with their &#x27;base cost&#x27; i.e. the cost prevailing at the time of submitting\nthe bid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">29.    The submissions of both the parties have been recorded in the Arbitral\nAward at various places. The details are given as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       &quot;6.11.        As already stated in para 6.05.1 the Claimants\n       representative brought out that definition of cost when read in\n       conjunction with sub Clause 70.3 (c) (ii) and (iii) of COPA in\n       the Note given below sub Clause 70.3(xi) this Note would read\n       as X,Y,Z are the actual percentage of all expenditure properly\n       incurred on the site including overheads and other charges and\n       excluding any allowance for profit for material of bitumen,\n       cement and steel respectively used for execution of work as per\n       <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">IPC</a> for the month. The Claimants representative further\n       contended that it is actual current/ invoices cost of these\n       materials during a particular month that needs to be taken into\n       account for calculating these percentages variable X,Y,Z. It is\n       further elaborated by definition of &#x27;R&#x27; in the formula which\n       relates to adjustment for secured advance at the current rate for\n       a particular <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a> and therefore the concept of current rate is\n       already there in the formula of price adjustment.\n       6.12.        Thus the actual current/ invoice cost of these\n       materials during a particular month that needs to be taken into\n       account in calculating percentage variables of X,Y,Z.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                          Page 16 of 27</span>\n        7.4.1.       According to Respondents, the true intent and\n       spirit as well as the purpose of clause 70.3(xi) is that for\n       calculating the percentages of X, Y, Z the price of the\n       respective materials i.e. bitumen, cement and steel that were\n       prevailing at the time of the BOQ are to be taken and shall\n       remain constant throughout the contract and the current market\n       prices of these materials, which can change frequently, cannot\n       be taken for calculating these percentages.\n       8.10.         The contention of the Respondents is that the\n       entire price adjustment formulae are based on the underlying\n       principle of &#x27;cost&#x27; as it existed in the month previous to the date\n       of submission of the Bids and the current indices/prices to work\n       out the price adjustment and that the price prevailing in the\n       month previous to the date of submission of the Bids needs to\n       be taken into account even for working out these percentage\n       X,Y,Z Based on this interpretation of the Note below Sub\n       clause 70.3(xi) and implications of Sub Clause 1.1(e)(i). Clause\n       6 of Preamble to BOQ, Clause-14 of Instructions to Bidders.\n       Sub clauses 701 to 70.3 Clause 60.1/60.9 in the Contract it\n       contends that working out these percentages X,Y,Z by using the\n       current invoice cost is not the intent in the contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">30.    The contract contains a similar definition of the word &#x27;cost&#x27; in Clause\n1.1 (g) (i) which has been reproduced by the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph\n4.02.1 of the Arbitral Award as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       &quot;Cost means all expenditure properly incurred or to be incurred\n       whether on or off the site including overhead and other charges\n       properly allocated thereto but does not include any allowance\n       for profit.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">31.    Therefore, it is to be examined in the present case as to whether the\nprice adjustment clause contemplates the usage of the &#x27;current cost&#x27; or &#x27;base\ncost&#x27; of the items of the work that correspond to the elements of X, Y and Z\nand as to whether the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are liable to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                        Page 17 of 27</span>\n interfered with in exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 34</a>\nof the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">32.    The findings of the Arbitral Tribunal in the present case are as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">       &quot;9.4. The AT Noted that the cost of these materials is a\n       function of quantity and rate. Since the quantity is a variable in\n       every <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">IPC</a>, the intention of the contract was to make these\n       percentage components as dynamic variables to try to make the\n       price adjustment formulae as rational and realistic as possible.\n       9.5. AT further Noted that the dispute is regarding the rate to\n       be taken into account in working out the cost viz. the rate too is\n       to be variable current rate from time to time or a fixed rate. Had\n       the contract intended only the quantity to be the variable and a\n       fixed predefined rate, the Note below Clause 70.3(xi) could\n       have been worded accordingly. However the AT is to interpret\n       the contract as it exists in terms of Supreme Court judgment\n       (2009) 5 SCC 313. It is observed that the certain percentage of\n       the current cost of materials brought to site goes into the\n       valuation of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a> as secured materials advance. A reference to\n       Sub-Clause 60.3 of COPA is relevant:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       Sub-Clause 60.3: Materials for Permanent Works.\n       With respect to materials brought by the Contractor to the site\n       for incorporation in the permanent works the contractor shall (i)\n       receive a credit in the month in which these materials are\n       brought to the site and (ii) be charged a debit in the month in\n       which they are incorporated in to the Permanent works both\n       such credit and debit to be determined by the Engineer in\n       accordance with the following provisions:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       (a) no credit shall be given unless the following conditions shall\n       have been met to the Engineers satisfaction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">       (i) the materials and Plant are in accordance with the\n       specifications for the Works:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                        Page 18 of 27</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">        (ii) the materials and Plant have been delivered to the site and\n       are properly stored and protected against loss damage or\n       deterioration.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">       (iii) the Contractors records of requirement, orders, receipts and\n       use of materials are kept in a form approved by the Engineer,\n       and such records are available for inspection by the Engineer:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       (iv) the Contractor has submitted a statement of his cost of\n       acquiring and delivering the materials to the Site, together with\n       such documents as may be required for the purpose of\n       evidencing such cost; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">       (v) the origin of the materials and currencies of payment\n       there for are those indicated in the Appendix to Bid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">       (vi) The materials and plant shall be incorporated or used\n       within 90 days period.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">       (b) the amount to be credited to the contractor shall be\n       equivalent of 75 percent of the Contractor&#x27;s reasonable cost of\n       materials delivered to the site after review of the documents\n       listed in sub paragraph (a) (v) above as determined by the\n       Engineer.

The stipulation in the formulae for\n       apportioning a part of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">IPC</a> amount to different materials is\n       not to be confused with the price adjustment as such. This cost\n       or any other cost taken into account in working out the\n       percentage factors X, Y, Z could affect only the weight age\n       given to a particular material in apportioning a percentage of\n       the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">IPC</a> cost to that material and parties could agree to any\n       mode for working out such apportioning of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a> valuation. A\n       plain reading of the Note below sub Clause 70.3(xi) does not by\n       any means indicate or even imply that the cost of a material on\n       a date 28 days prior to the submission of bids is intended to be\n       taken into account for calculating the X,Y,Z percentages.

It appears from the above that the Arbitral Tribunal has come to a\nconclusion that since the &#x27;actual percentage&#x27; was to be calculated in reference\nto the &#x27;work done&#x27; for a &#x27;particular month&#x27;, it is the usage of the current cost\nthat is contemplated by the price adjustment formula in as much as it is the\ncurrent cost that would be representative of the work done in a particular\nmonth rather than an alleged base cost of several months or years prior.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">34.    The Arbitral Tribunal has also observed that the &#x27;Note&#x27; appended\nbelow the price adjustment clause nowhere stipulates the usage of the base\ncost, though the petitioner, being the drafter of the contract, could have\nexplicitly provided for the same when it drafted the Note. It appears to the\nCourt that the Arbitral Tribunal has taken a plausible view; it is to be\nconsidered as to whether this can be interfered with in exercise of the limited\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 34</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77286517\" id=\"span_24\">35.    In the present case, the petitioner is not able to show any explicit\nstipulation in the &#x27;Note&#x27; appended about the price adjustment clause that it is\nthe base rate which is to be utilized. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that\nthe Arbitral Tribunal has construed the contract in unfair manner; it could be\ninterpreted totally in a different way by a reasonable person.

It is also a matter of fact and it has come on record that when the\nBSCPL case came up before a Single Bench of this Court on 15 th April,\n2014, it was in fact the submission of the petitioner itself that the issue\ninvolved in the BSCPL case is the same as the one in the present case, i.e.\nO.M.P. No.1003/2013. The averment to this effect made by the petitioner\nbefore this Court on 15th April, 2014 in the BSCPL case is as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">       &quot;Learned senior counsel for the petitioner states that the issue\n       involved in the present petitions has not been decided by this\n       Court. He further submits that in another petition, i.e. O.M.P.\n       No.1003/2013 titled NHAI Vs Progressive MVR the same issue\n       is pending consideration before this Court and is listed on\n       14.07.2014.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">       List along with O.M.P.

The second submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is also\ncovered from the few findings of the Single Judge of this Court in the\nBSCPL case and the Arbitral Tribunal therein. Apart from the fact that the\nArbitral Tribunal and the Single Judge in the BSCPL case, on an\ninterpretation of the price adjustment clause, rejected the contention of the\npetitioner that it was the base rate/cost that was to be utilized in computing\nthe elements of X, Y and Z, and it was further observed that after giving a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                       Page 21 of 27</span>\n particular interpretation to the terms of contract for considerable period, a\nparty to a contract cannot unilaterally change it to the disadvantage of the\nother party. This observation was in the context of the facts that the\npetitioner had, for the majority of the contract period in the BSCPL case i.e.\nfor 19 bills, adopted the current rate/cost and subsequently unilaterally\nsought to change the methodology and adopt the alleged base rate/cost. The\nsubmission of the petitioner is that since in the present case, the respondent\nhad raised bills as per the petitioner&#x27;s interpretation/methodology for 9 bills,\nand subsequently sought to claim the current rate/cost from the 10 th bill\nonwards, the award in the present case is liable to be set aside in light of this\nconduct of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">38.    The submissions have no force, as the finding of the Division Bench\nin the BSCPL case, into which the order of the Single Judge merged, was\npurely on the question of interpretation of the contractual terms and which\nhaving been found to be in favour of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"9741462\" id=\"span_27\">39.    Learned counsel for the respondents submits that as a matter of fact, a\nsimilar argument of the petitioner, pertaining to a set of disputes between it\nand certain contractors, was rejected by a Single Judge of this Court i.e.\nHon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Shakdher in the case of <a href=\"/doc/9741462/\" id=\"a_31\">National Highways\nAuthority of India v. KMC-RK-SD (JV</a>), being O.M.P. No.1043/2013\ndecided on 22nd October, 2013 wherein the similar clause was involved. The\nsaid factual position has not been denied by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner. In the said case, this Court was faced with similar situation in the\nsense that an award was sought to be challenged by the petitioner, though\nthere were already judicial pronouncements of this Court on the same issue\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                        Page 22 of 27</span>\n against it, on the ground that in the previous judicial pronouncements it had\nbeen noted that the petitioner has itself made payment of certain bills as per\nthe interpretation of the contract whereas in the subject case the contractor\nhad claimed initial bills as per contrary interpretation i.e. the interpretation of\nthe petitioner. The said Bench recorded the relevant facts and the arguments\nof the petitioner on this score in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">       &quot;3.6 During the course of the execution of the works in issue,\n       the respondent submitted five (5) Interim Payment Certificates\n       (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_32\">IPC</a>s). Amounts against the said five (5) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_33\">IPC</a>s were collected.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">       It is when the respondent sought to file the sixth (6th) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_34\">IPC</a>, that\n       it submitted its price escalation not only for the previous five\n       (5) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_35\">IPC</a>s, but also for the sixth (6th) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_36\">IPC</a>. This submission was\n       made by the respondent with the engineer on 21.01.2008. The\n       engineer, vide his order dated 22.01.2008, rejected the\n       respondent&#x27;s claim for price adjustment, on the ground that,\n       there was no provision for payment towards price adjustment in\n       the contract. In this behalf reference was made to clause 70 of\n       the COPA. 3.7 In terms of the contract obtaining between the\n       parties, the respondent escalated the issue by making a\n       grievance with the Dispute Resolution Board (in short DRB).\n       The DRB, by a majority of 2:1 decided in favour of the\n       petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">       5.    Mr.Kapur, who argued in support of the petition, assailed\n       the Award on the following grounds:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">              &quot;...(iv) The respondent had accepted payments against\n              five (5) <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_37\">IPC</a>s without seeking price adjustment. In other\n              words, respondent was all along aware that it will not be\n              allowed price adjustments on all items of the BOQ, as\n              demanded. For this purpose, reliance was also placed on\n              the averments made in the statement of claims. It was\n              sought to be demonstrated that the respondent chose the\n              route of going through the engineer in the first instance,\n              then the DRB, and finally, the arbitral route as it was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">OMP Nos.1003/2013 &amp; 54/2015                                          Page 23 of 27</span>\n               aware that the petitioner would not concede to its\n              demand.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">40.

The aforesaid judgment of the Single Judge was carried in appeal by\nthe petitioner before a Division Bench of this Court in F.A.O.(OS)\nNo.139/2014.

The\n       appellant had filed the said O.M.P under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 34</a> of the\n       Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 challenging the Award\n       passed by a three Member Arbitral Tribunal on 11.06.2013. The\n       learned single Judge while rejecting the petition had Noted in\n       paragraph 9 that the very contentions which were raised by the\n       learned counsel for the appellant before him had been\n       considered in earlier cases including the case of <a href=\"/doc/119594747/\" id=\"a_44\">National\n       Highways Authority of India vs Unitech-NCC Joint Venture</a>\n       and those contentions had been rejected by the learned single\n       Judge.

Upon reading of the aforesaid decisions which are binding upon this\nCourt and examination of the facts of the present case, it appears that once\nthe Arbitral Tribunal after discussion has come to the conclusion that the\ncontract contemplated the utilization of the current cost in the price\nadjustment clause, and when the similar findings in connected cases have\nbeen given, this Court should not take the different view, as the said\njudgments were upheld up to the Supreme Court. Raising of few bills to the\ncontrary in the initial part of the contract by the respondent would not make\nany difference. Admittedly, there were a total of 36 bills raised by the\nrespondent during the execution of the subject work; the respondent raised 9\nbills in terms of the interpretation propounded by the petitioner. From the\n10th bill onwards and all the way up to the 36 th bill i.e. till the conclusion of\nthe subject work, the respondent adopted the interpretation by abandoning\nthe earlier methodology of preparation of bills, at a relatively early stage in\nthe work which is upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal, the respondent, in fact,\nhas not changed the settled interpretation or methodology at the stage of the\ncontract.
