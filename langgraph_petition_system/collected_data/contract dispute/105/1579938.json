Upon completion of the work the respondent \nherein submitted final bill which was allegedly not accepted by the \nappellant, whereafter  they themselves prepared the final bill and \nforwarded the same along with a printed format being a &quot;No Demand \nCertificate&quot;.

We further confirm that we shall have no claim/ \ndemands in future in respect of this contract of \nwhatsoever nature, final or otherwise.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2.\tWe would now request you to please release our security \ndeposit/ contract performance Guarantee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\"> \tHowever, on the same day a letter dated 20-12-1990 was \nwritten by the respondent to the appellant stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;We have completed the aforementioned work \nin the Kayamkulam Super Thermal Power \nProject&#x27;s temporary township area at \nNangiarkulangara by the end of November 1990 \nitself.  We had submitted a pre-final bill \nin November itself but the authorities \ndenied the bill and insisted final bill.  \nBut when the alleged final bill was prepared \nthe authorities insisted that a &quot;No Demand \nCertificate&quot; should be executed by us in \nfavour of the Corporation.  They served us \nwith a printed specimen of the document and \ninsisted that it should be typed in our own \nletterhead and submitted to the N.T.P.C.  We \nrefused to submit such a document.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">But the authorities of N.T.P.C. threatened \nthat unless and until we execute the said \ndocument in favour of the Corporation, the \nN.T.P.C. would not effect payment of our \nbill.  More than six lakhs of Rupees is \npending for payment vide the alleged final \nbill.  We have incurred huge losses in the \nexecution of the work purely due to the \nlatches and lapses of the corporation.  More \nover lakhs and lakhs of rupees has to be \npaid to our Bankers, creditors suppliers, \nworkers, truck owners etc. etc.  Under such \na situation we have no other way other than \nbudging to the coercion of the authorities \nof N.T.P.C. ltd. to get whatever they give \nmerely for the necessity of our survival.  \nWe have to comply with the instructions of \nauthorities of N.T.P.C. Ltd. out of our \nhelplessness in order to receive payment.  \nHence this letter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The certificates, undertakings, etc. as \naforesaid have been executed without \nprejudice to our rights and claims \nwhatsoever on account of the alleged final \nbill.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">The money invested in the work comprises \nloans from the Federal Bank Ltd., private \nfinanciers, etc. as well the Firm&#x27;s own \nfunds.  Those additional sums raised by \nloans have to be paid to the Bank, \nfinanciers, etc. hence under duress, \ncoerction and under undue influence we are \nsigning the bill and execute such documents \nas aforesaid to receive payment.  Under such \ncoercive circumstances the alleged final \nbill cannot be constructed as final bill.  \nWe are signing the alleged final bill under \ncoerction, under undue influence and under \nprotest only without prejudice to our rights \nand claims whatsoever.  There is no accord \nand satisfaction between the contracting \nparties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">You are therefore requested to kindly pass \nthe final bill incorporating all the \nmeasurements of the items such as sinkage, \nin and under water execution of works, \ncompensation for suspension of works, \nreimbursement of cost escalation due to \nprice hike of petroleum products, cost of \nidling, enhanced rates for quantities \nexecuted beyond the contractual period, \nmarket rate for excess quantities, extra \nadditional items etc. besides the losses and \ndamages by way of idling of tools and \nplants, workmen, staff, establishment costs, \ncapital outlay, interest etc. as per \nactuals.

The \nsubsequent allegation of coercion is an \nafterthought and a devise to get over the \nsettlement of the dispute, acceptance of the \npayment and receipt voluntarily given.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\"> \tWe, however, may observe that the quotation from Russell on \nArbitration may not be apt inasmuch as at the stage of reference \nwhat would be a good defence is not a matter to be taken into \nconsideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"> \tYet again in Nathani Steels Ltd. (supra) the disputes and \ndifferences were amicably settled by and between the parties and in \nthat view of the matter it was held that unless and until the \nstatement is set aside, the arbitration clause cannot be invoked.  \nSuch is not the position here.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\"> \tThe appellant herein did not raise a question that there has \nbeen a novation of contract.  The conduct of the parties as \nevidenced in their letters, as noticed hereinbefore, clearly go to \nshow that not only the final bill submitted by the respondent was \nrejected but another final bill was prepared with a printed format \nthat a &quot;No Demand Certificate&quot; has been executed as other final \nbill would not be paid.  The respondent herein, as noticed \nhereinbefore, categorically stated in its letter dated 20.12.1990 \nthat as to under what circumstances they were compelled to sign the \nsaid printed letter.  It  appeares from the appendix appended to \nthe judgment of the learned Trial Judge that the said letter was \nfiled even before the trial court.  It is, therefore, not a case \nwhether the respondent&#x27;s assertion of &quot;under influence or coercion&quot; \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">can be said to have been taken by way of an afterthought. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\"> \tEven when rights and obligations of the parties are worked \nout the contract does not come to an end inter alia for the purpose \nof  determination of the disputes arising thereunder, and, thus, \nthe arbitration agreement can be invoked. Although it may not be \nstrictly in place but we cannot shut our eyes to the ground reality \nthat in the cases where a contractor has made huge investment, he \ncannot afford not to take from the employer the amount under the \nbills, for various reasons which may include discharge of his \nliability towards the banks, financial institutions and other \npersons.  In such a situation, the public sector undertakings would \nhave an upper hand.  They would not ordinarily release the money \nunless a &#x27;No Demand Certificate&#x27; is signed.  Each case, therefore, \nis required to be considered on its own facts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\"> \tFurther, necessitas non habet legem is an old age maxim which \nmeans necessity knows no law.  A person may sometimes have to \nsuccumb to the pressure of other party to the bargain who is on a \nstronger position.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\"> \tWe may, however, hasten to add that such a case has to be \nmade out and proved before the Arbitrator for obtaining an award.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\"> \tAt this stage, the Court, however, will only be concerned \nwith the question whether triable issues have been raised which are \nrequired to be determined by the Arbitrators.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\"> \tCircumstances leading to passing an order by the courts of \nlaw directing the parties to get their disputes determined by \ndomestic tribunal selected by them having regard to the \ncorrespondences exchanged between the solicitors came up for \nconsideration in Goodman Vs. Winchester and Alton Rly [(1984) 3 All \nER 594] wherein it was held:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">&quot;As I have already recounted, the \nplaintiff&#x27;s solicitor may have had in mind \nthat if there were an arbitration clause \nvarious matters could be sorted out cheaply \nand quickly under it.  There is no evidence, \nin my judgment, that when he drafted the \nterms of the arbitration clause he had in \nmind that it would not apply to a \nrepudiation of the contract by the \ndefendants.  He is a solicitor; he is \nclearly an experienced solicitor; and he \nshould have appreciated (and I feel certain \nhe did) that the arbitration clause which he \ndrafted, and which was accepted by the \ndefendants, would cover every aspect of the \ncontract, including repudiation.  But, apart \naltogether from what the plaintiff&#x27;s \nsolicitor had in mind, there is no evidence \nat all as to what the defendant company had \nin mind when it agreed to accept the \narbitration clause, and it was wrong, in my \njudgment, for the Judge to say that neither \nparty had in mind that it would apply to the \nsummary dismissal of the plaintiff.  It \nfollows, therefore, that at the very \nbeginning of his judgment the judge \nmisdirected himself as to the construction \nof the arbitration clause and what it was \nmended to deal with.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"> \tEven correspondences marked as without prejudice may have to \nbe interpreted differently in different situations.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"> \tWhat would be the effect of without prejudice offer has been \nconsidered in Cutts Vs.

It seems to be \nthat, no issue of public policy being \ninvolved, it would be wrong to say that the \nwords were given a meaning in 1889 which \nisimmutable ever after, bearing in mind that \nthe precise question with which we are \nconcerned in this case did not arise in \nWalker v. Wilsher, 23 Q.B.D. 335, and the \ncourt did not deal with it.  I think that \nthe wide body of practice which undoubtedly \nexists must be treated as indicating that \nthe meaning to be given to the words is \naltered if the offer contains the \nreservation relating to the use of the offer \nin relation to costs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"> \tYet again in Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd.

The nature \nof the implied agreement must depend on the \nmeaning which is conventionally attached to \nthe phrase &#x27;without prejudice&#x27;.  The classic \ndefinition of the phrase is contained in the \njudgment of Lindley LJ in Walker v.

I think they mean without \nprejudice to the position of the writer of \nthe letter if the terms he proposes are not \naccepted.  If the terms proposed in the \nletter are accepted a complete contract is \nestablished, and the letter, although \nwritten without prejudice, operates to alter \nthe old state of things and to establish a \nnew one.&#x27;\n\nAlthough this definition was not necessary \nfor the facts of that particular case and \nwas therefore strictly obiter, it was \nexpressly approved by this court in Tomlin v \nStandard Telephones and Cables Ltd.

It is open to the parties to \nthe correspondence to give the phrase a \nsomewhat different meaning, e.g. where they \nreserve the right to bring an offer made \n&#x27;without prejudice&#x27; to the attention of the \ncourt on the question of costs if the offer \nbe not accepted (See Cutts v. Head) but \nsubject to any such modification as may be \nagreed between the parties, that is the \nmeaning of the phrase.  In particular, \nsubject to any such modification, the \nparties must be taken to have intended and \nagreed that the privilege will cease if and \nwhen the negotiations &#x27;without prejudice&#x27; \ncome to fruition in a concluded agreement.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1061704\" id=\"span_7\">Meaning the words &quot;without prejudice&quot; come up for \nconsideration before this Court in Superintendent (Tech. <a href=\"/doc/1061704/\" id=\"a_17\">I) Central \nExcise, I.D.D.

See, also Dismissal Without \nPrejudice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">Similarly, in Wharton&#x27;s Law Lexicon the \nauthor while interpreting the term &#x27;without \nprejudice&#x27; observed as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">The words import an understanding that if \nthe negotiation fails, nothing that has \npassed shall be taken advantage of \nthereafter; so, if a defendant offers, \n&#x27;without prejudice&#x27;, to pay half the claim, \nthe plaintiff must not only rely on the \noffer as an admission of his having a right \nto some payment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">The rule is that nothing written or said \n&#x27;without prejudice&#x27; can be considered at the \ntrial without the consent of both parties \u0016 \nnot even by a Judge in determining whether \nor not there is good cause for depriving a \nsuccessful litigant of costs \u0005.  The word is \nalso frequently used without the foregoing \nimplications in statutes and inter partes to \nexclude or save transactions, acts and \nrights from the consequences of a stated \nproposition and so as to mean &#x27;not \naffecting&#x27;, &#x27;saving&#x27; or &#x27;excepting&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\"> \tIn short, therefore, the implication of \nthe term &#x27;without prejudice&#x27; means (1) that \nthe cause or the matter has not been decided \non merits, (2) that fresh proceedings \naccording to law were not barred.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\"> \tThe appellant has in its letter dated 20th December, 1990 \nhas used the term &#x27;without prejudice&#x27;.
