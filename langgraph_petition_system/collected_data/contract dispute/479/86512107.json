The petitioner herein, who is a company registered under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_1\">Indian Companies Act, 1956</a> and engaged in coal loading\n\nand removing of overburden work, has called in question legality, validity and\n\ncorrectness of the impugned order dated 26.2.2019 (Annexure P/1) passed\n\nby respondent No.3 herein, by which Letter of Intent (LOI) dated 2.5.2018\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                        2</span>\n\nissued in its favour for work of Hiring of HEMM for OB removal including\n\nAccess Trench &amp; diversion of nallah at Jagannathpur OCM, Bhatgaon Area\n\nhas been cancelled and earnest money deposit amounting to ₹ 50,00,000/-\n\nhas been forfeited and eventually the petitioner herein has been debarred\n\nfrom participating in future bids for a period of 24 months and fresh tender for\n\nsaid work has been floated at the risk and cost of the petitioner herein.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.          The Central Government under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1769523/\" id=\"a_2\">Coal\n\nBearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957</a> (hereinafter called\n\nas &#x27;the Act of 1957&quot;) after issuance of notification under <a href=\"/doc/272099/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 8</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_4\">11</a> of\n\nthe Act of 1957 acquired 662.151 hectares of land at village Jagannathpur,\n\nTahsil Pratappur, District Surguja for open cast project of SECL at Bhatgaon\n\narea by notifications dated 4th August, 2010 and 3rd March, 2011 and thereby\n\nthe subject land stands vested with the Central Government and thereafter\n\nwith respondent-SECL under <a href=\"/doc/1907423/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 10</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_6\">11</a> of the Act of 1957, but the\n\ncompany have no power to transfer the said land without prior approval of\n\nthe Central Government. The Additional Collector, Surajpur by its order dated\n\n17.4.2018 directed that name of the respondent-SECL be recorded in the\n\nacquired land at village Jagannathpur and Pampapur. The land having\n\nvested with the respondent-SECL under <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 11</a> of the Act of 1957, the\n\nrespondent-SECL on 30.10.2017 (Annexure P/3) floated e-tender notice\n\ninviting applications from reputed and experienced contractors for Hiring of\n\nHEMM for excavating all kinds of strata/overburden/in situ, loading in to\n\ntippers, transportation and unloading of excavated materials &amp; silt, dumping,\n\ndozing, scrapping/removal of all bands, preparation/maintenance of haul\n\nroad, water sprinkling and spreading of material at the site shown. The\n\npetitioner herein submitted its bid for the said work on 14.11.2017, which the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                         3</span>\n\nrespondent-SECL requested it to accord its consent for extension of bid\n\nvalidity period for a period of 120 days, which was accepted by the petitioner\n\nand ultimately, the petitioner&#x27;s bid was accepted on 2.5.2018 and Letter of\n\nIntent was issued in its favour. It is the case of the petitioner that the CMPDI\n\nteam as well as the petitioner went to mines to carry out initial measurement,\n\nbut the villagers assaulted them and therefore, measurement could not be\n\nundertaken and thus, on 11.6.2018 the petitioner requested the respondent-\n\nSECL to handover the site and in turn, the respondent-SECL requested to\n\nmeet him personally to discuss the issue on 19.6.2018. On 20.6.2018, the\n\npetitioner requested the respondent-SECL to refund its earnest money\n\ndeposit and on 24.6.2018 the respondent-SECL requested the petitioner to\n\npersonally meet and discuss the issue which was reiterated by the\n\nrespondent-SECL on 5.7.2018 and ultimately, on 5.7.2018 the petitioner\n\nmade its stand clear and requested the respondent-SECL to refund its\n\nearnest money deposit. Thereafter, the petitioner filed writ petition being\n\nWP(C) No.2146 of 2018 before this Court seeking refund of its earnest\n\nmoney deposit and thereafter, the respondent-SECL issued show-cause\n\nnotice to the petitioner as to why its Letter of Intent (LOI) issued to it be not\n\ncancelled and earnest money deposit be not forfeited, which the petitioner\n\nreplied. The writ petition was disposed of by this Court on 13.9.2018\n\nreserving liberty in favour of the respondents to take decision on the issue.\n\nAfter consideration, on 26.2.2019, Letter of Intent issued in favour of the\n\npetitioner was cancelled by the impugned order and earnest money deposit\n\nwas forfeited and the petitioner company has been debarred from\n\nparticipating in future bids, which has been questioned in this writ petition\n\nstating inter-alia that statutory clearance for the said work was not obtained\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        4</span>\n\nby the respondent-SECL right in time and possession was not with the SECL,\n\ntherefore, work could not be undertaken by it and despite repeated requests,\n\nthe respondent-SECL did not pay any heed to the request made by the\n\npetitioner except making verbal assurances, which led the petitioner to make\n\na request to the respondent-SECL for refund of its earnest money deposit\n\nwhich they failed to refund and which compelled the petitioner to file this writ\n\npetition challenging their illegal and arbitrary action of forfeiting huge amount\n\nof ₹ 50,00,000/-, which is unsustainable and bad in law, as such, the\n\nimpugned order is liable to be set aside and appropriate writ be issued\n\ndirecting the respondent-SECL to refund ₹ 50,00,000/-, which has been\n\ndeposited by the petitioner as earnest money by quashing the impugned\n\ncommunication dated 26.2.2019 (Annexure P/1).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.          Return has been filed by the respondent-SECL stating inter-alia\n\nthat the petitioner has remedy of invoking arbitration clause in terms of\n\nclause 13 of conditions of contract for resolution of dispute and if it feels\n\naggrieved and dissatisfied with the order of the competent authority, it may\n\nget its dispute, if any, settled by invoking the arbitration clause under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_8\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, as such, the writ petition deserves to\n\nbe dismissed on the ground of availability of statutory remedy to it under the\n\nterms of contract. It has also been pleaded on merits that statutory clearance\n\nfrom forest and environment under the Act was obtained right in time i.e. prior\n\nto floating of tender on 30.10.2017 and permission of Coal Controller was\n\nalso obtained on 27.4.2018. Acquisition has also been completed in all\n\nrespects under the Act of 1957 and 95% land being possessed by the SECL\n\nand 94% land holders have already been paid compensation and mutation\n\nproceeding has already been completed pursuant to order of the Additional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         5</span>\n\nCollector, Surajpur dated 17.4.2018. The petitioner did not commence the\n\nwork right in time and it is guilty of delay in commencing the work by\n\nmisinterpreting the terms of contract as well as the terms of NIT and\n\ntherefore, its Letter of Intent has rightly been cancelled and consequently, in\n\naccordance with the terms of NIT, earnest money deposit amounting to ₹\n\n50,00,000/- has been forfeited and it has been blacklisted for 24 months and\n\nfresh tender has been floated for the said work at the risk and cost of the\n\npetitioner, which is strictly as per terms of contract and no interference is\n\ncalled for in exercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4.           Mr.Bharat Sangal, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the petitioner, would submit that action of the respondent-SECL in\n\ncancelling the Letter of Intent (LOI) issued in favour of the petitioner including\n\nforfeiture of earnest money deposit is arbitrary, illegal and contrary to law, as\n\nfrom the Letter of Intent dated 2.5.2018 it was quite vivid that statutory\n\nclearance and physical possession of subject land was not available with the\n\nrespondent-SECL, yet Letter of Intent was issued in favour of the petitioner in\n\nhasty manner. He would further submit that even after a month of issuance of\n\nLetter of Intent (LOI) when the petitioner mobilized its men and machinery at\n\nthe site, work could not be commenced because statutory clearances and\n\nphysical possession of land were not available with the respondent-SECL\n\nand despite being informed to the respondents-authorities, they did not pay\n\nany heed to the request made by the petitioner except making verbal\n\nassurances and when the petitioner filed writ petition seeking refund of\n\nearnest money deposit, the respondent-SECL issued show-cause notice and\n\ncancelled the Letter of Intent (LOI) issued in favour of the petitioner and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                       6</span>\n\nforfeited its earnest money deposit, which is violative of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nfundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_11\">19 (1) (g)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. Therefore, the impugned order dated 26.2.2019\n\n(Annexure P/1) passed by respondent No.3 deserves to be set aside and\n\nappropriate writ be issued directing the respondents to refund an amount of ₹\n\n50,00,000/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.             Mr.Vivek Chopda, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondents/SECL, would submit that the dispute relating to cancellation of\n\ncontract and forfeiture of earnest money is arbitrable dispute and it can be\n\nresolved by way of clause 13 of conditions of contract, which provides\n\nsettlement of dispute and clause 13A of conditions of contract provides\n\nsettlement of dispute through Arbitration. He would further submit that the\n\nmatter relates to breach of contract and the present petition involves disputed\n\nquestion of fact, therefore, the petitioner be relegated to the remedy of\n\narbitration as contained in clause 13A of the conditions of contract.\n\nMr.Chopda on merit of the matter would submit that despite all statutory\n\nclearance and vacant subject land was provided to the petitioner, he did not\n\ncommence the work in question, by which after giving him notice and\n\nopportunity of hearing, subject Letter of Intent (LIO) was cancelled and\n\nearnest money deposit (EMD) has been forfeited in favour of respondent-\n\nSECL, which is strictly in accordance with law, as such, the writ petition as\n\nframed and filed deserves to be dismissed with cost(s).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.             We have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties and\n\nconsidered their rival submissions made hereinabove and also went through\n\nthe records with utmost circumspection.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                           7</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">7.             The first preliminary objection is that the dispute raised by way of\n\nthis writ petition is arbitrable by way of clause 13A of conditions of contract,\n\nwhich provides settlement of disputes through arbitration under the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 1996 as amended by the Act of 2015. Undoubtedly,\n\nthe dispute is arbitrable and the petitioner has remedy of arbitration under the\n\nAct of 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">8.             It is well settled that the rule of exclusion of writ jurisdiction by\n\navailability of an alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of\n\ncompulsion. In an appropriate case, in spite of availability of alternative\n\nremedy, this Court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction at least in three\n\ncontingencies: (i) where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any of the\n\nfundamental rights; (ii) where there is failure of principles of natural justice; or\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1603548\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172383107\" id=\"span_8\">(iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the\n\nvires of an Act is challenged (See <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_12\">Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade\n\nMarks</a> 1 and <a href=\"/doc/1603548/\" id=\"a_13\">Harbanslal Sahnia and another v. Indian Oil Corpn.

It is the case of the petitioner herein that the respondent-SECL\n\ndid not provide possession of subject land to execute/initiate the work in\n\nquestion despite repeated requests made by him and made only oral\n\nassurances by which he could not commence the work in question and when\n\nhe filed writ petition before this Court for refund of earnest money, show-\n\ncause notice for cancellation of contract in question was issued and\n\nthereafter, Letter of Intent was cancelled and his earnest money deposit was\n\nforfeited, as such, the respondent-SECL has acted most arbitrarily,\n\nparticularly, forfeiting the earnest money amounting to ₹ 50,00,000/-, which is\n1 (1998) 8 SCC 1\n2 (2003) 2 SCC 107\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         8</span>\n\nex-facie arbitrary. In view of above, we are entertaining the writ petition to the\n\nextent of examining and finding out as to whether forfeiture of earnest money\n\nto the tune of ₹ 50,00,000/- is legal and proper or it suffers from vice of\n\narbitrariness leaving rest of dispute with regard to cancellation of contract,\n\nblacklisting and fresh tender for the said work and risk and cost to be raised\n\nby the petitioner by way of arbitration as provided in clause 13A of the\n\nconditions of contract, as such, the writ petition is entertained only to that\n\nextent indicated hereinabove leaving rest of the dispute to be adjudicated by\n\nway of arbitration, if any, to be invoked by the petitioner or avail any other\n\nremedy available to him under the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">10.          The next preliminary objection is that since the Letter of Intent\n\nhas been cancelled and consequently, earnest money deposit has been\n\nforfeited and that being realm of contract, writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India is not maintainable ?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_10\">11.          The question so posed for consideration is no longer res-integra\n\nand stands authoritatively and conclusively decided by Their Lordships of the\n\nSupreme Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_15\">ABL International Ltd. and another v.\n\nExport Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. and others</a> 3 in which\n\nTheir Lordships have held that a writ petition involving serious disputed\n\nquestions of facts which requires consideration of evidence which is not on\n\nrecord, will not normally be entertained by a court in the exercise of its\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, but in an appropriate cases,\n\nthe writ Court has the jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving disputed\n\nquestion of fact and there is no absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition\n\neven if the same arises out of a contractual obligation and/or involves some\n\n3 (2004) 3 SCC 553\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                         9</span>\n\ndisputed questions of fact and even it was held that a writ petition involving a\n\nconsequential relief of monetary claim is maintainable.

This\n               clearly shows that in an appropriate case, the writ court\n               has the jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving\n               disputed questions of fact and there is no absolute bar for\n               entertaining a writ petition even if the same arises out of a\n               contractual obligation and/or involves some disputed\n               questions of fact.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               27.

However, while entertaining an objection as to the\n               maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the\n               Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact\n               that the power to issue prerogative writs under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a>\n               of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by\n               any other provisions of the Constitution. The High Court\n               having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to\n               entertain or not to entertain a writ petition.

The principles which can be culled out from the above\n               noted judgments are:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">               (i) No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to what act\n               would constitute taking of possession of the acquired land.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">               (ii) If the acquired land is vacant, the act of the concerned\n               State authority to go to the spot and prepare a panchnama\n               will ordinarily be treated as sufficient to constitute taking of\n               possession.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">               (iii) If crop is standing on the acquired land or\n               building/structure exists, mere going on the spot by the\n               concerned authority will, by itself, be not sufficient for\n               taking possession. Ordinarily, in such cases, the\n               concerned authority will have to give notice to the occupier\n               of the building/structure or the person who has cultivated\n               the land and take possession in the presence of\n               independent witnesses and get their signatures on the\n               panchnama. Of course, refusal of the owner of the land or\n               building/structure may not lead to an inference that the\n               possession of the acquired land has not been taken.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">               (iv) If the acquisition is of a large tract of land, it may not be\n               possible for the acquiring/designated authority to take\n               physical possession of each and every parcel of the land\n               and it will be sufficient that symbolic possession is taken\n               by preparing appropriate document in the presence of\n               independent witnesses and getting their signatures on\n               such document.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">               (v)   If   beneficiary     of   the    acquisition   is   an\n               agency/instrumentality of the State and 80% of the total\n               compensation is deposited in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1513155/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 17(3A)</a> and\n               substantial portion of the acquired land has been utilised in\n               furtherance of the particular public purpose, then the Court\n               may reasonably presume that possession of the acquired\n               land has been taken.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">17.         The respondent-SECL has not brought any document including\n\npanchnama evidencing that he was placed in possession of subject land\n\nafter vesting of in his possession under <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 11</a> of the Act of 1957 after\n\n6 (2011) 5 SCC 394\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                       13</span>\n\nissuance of subject tender and before issuance of Letter of Intent in favour of\n\nthe petitioner as the respondents while floating the notice inviting tender\n\n(Annexure P/3) and while detailing the status of land on 30.10.2017\n\nspecifically stated that physical possession of land is expected within a\n\nperiod of two months, but while filing return, though the respondents have\n\nspecifically claimed 95% of land to be in their possession, but no document\n\nhas been brought on record placing them in possession of subject land which\n\nthey claimed to have given to the petitioner for execution of work in question.\n\nThe land has been acquired under the Act of 1957 and the manner of taking\n\npossession of huge land is also indicated by Their Lordships of the Supreme\n\nCourt in Banda Development Authority (supra) by preparing panchnama,\n\nwhich the respondents ought to have in their possession, but they did not\n\nproduce the same before this Court to support their plea that they were\n\nplaced in possession of subject land on which work of subject tender was\n\nrequired to be executed by the petitioner, which is apparent from the fact that\n\ndespite several requests made by the petitioner noticed hereinabove, the\n\nrespondents did not even give positive response except directing the\n\npetitioner to contact personally and gave oral assurances and promise and\n\nalso for the reasons that the respondents themselves have mentioned in\n\npara-8 of their return that subject land was under their possession, though\n\nthere was some obstruction by villagers due to which there was little delay in\n\nhanding over the site, however, after removing all such obstruction, the\n\npetitioner was called for initial measurement along with CMPDIL, as such, it\n\nis well established on record that the petitioner was not placed in physical\n\npossession of subject land for initiating and executing the work, which was\n\nawarded to him by the respondents. No such document like panchnama\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                       14</span>\n\nhaving given the possession by the competent authority to the respondent-\n\nSECL has been filed before this Court nor it is the case of the respondents\n\nthat on particular date possession of subject land was taken by the\n\ncompetent authority by preparing panchnama in presence of witnesses and\n\nthereafter the respondents came in possession over the subject land on\n\nwhich work was required to be executed by removing overburden etc. It has\n\nnowhere been stated by the respondents that they came in possession of\n\nsubject land on particular date and possession has already been handed\n\nover to the petitioner which goes to show that the petitioner was never placed\n\nin possession of subject land for execution of work in question. Therefore, we\n\nare of the considered opinion that the petitioner/contractor had reasonable\n\ncause or valid reason in not commencing the execution of work within the\n\nstipulated time in terms of clause 6.1 of conditions of contract and therefore,\n\nforfeiture of earnest money deposit on account of non-execution work within\n\nthe stipulated time and consequently, forfeiture of earnest money deposit to\n\nthe extent of ₹ 50,00,000/- suffers from vice of arbitrariness and smacks total\n\nnon-application of mind, which is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia and consequently, the impugned order to that extent deserves to be\n\nstruck down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">18.
