C.M.A.Nos.96, 97, 98 and 101/99 have been preferred\nfrom the order of the learned Subordinate  Judge  dismissing  the\nfour  interlocutory  applications  in IA 1334/98 in OS 675/98, IA\n1341/98 in OS 663/98, IA 1336/98 in OS 678/98 and IA  1338/98  in\nOS  681/98, filed by the petitioners herein for stay of the trial\nof the said four suits filed by the respondents/plaintiffs, while\nCMA Nos.99, 100, 102 and 103/99 were preferred from the order  of\nthe  learned Subordinate Judge made in another four interlocutory\napplications in IA 809/98 in OS 678/98, IA 78 6/98 in OS  663/98,\nIA  811/98  in  OS  681/98  and  IA 807/98 in OS 675/98, granting       \ntemporary injunction in favour of the plaintiffs, sought  for  in\nthose applications.   The respondents herein filed O.S.Naos.663/9\n8, 675/98, 678/98 and 681/98 on the file  of  the  II  Additional\nSubordinate  Judge,  Coimbatore, seeking for declaration that the\nmemorandum of settlement entered into between the plaintiffs  and\nthe second defendant in respect of the contracts between them did\nnot   subsist   and   for   consequential   permanent  injunction\nrestraining  the  defendants  from  treating  the  contracts   as\nsubsisting or making or enforcing any claim thereunder.  In those\nsuits, the respondents filed I.A.Nos.786, 807, 809 and 811/98 for\ninterim  injunction  restraining the defendants from treating the\ncontracts  as  subsisting  or  making  or  enforcing  any   claim\nthereunder pending  disposal  of  the  suits.   On contest by the\npetitioners/defendants,  those  interlocutory  applications  were\nallowed  by the trial court, granting the interim relief as asked  \nfor.  The four civil miscellaneous appeals in CMAs 99,  100,  102\nand  103/99, which arose therefrom were also dismissed confirming\nthe order of the trial court.  Aggrieved defendants have  brought\nforth  the  four  civil revision petitions in CRPs 530, 965, 1007\nand 1535 of  2001.    The  defendants  filed  four  interlocutory\napplications in  I.As.   1334, 1341, 1336 and 1338 /98 under Ss.8 \nand 45 of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_2\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and<a href=\"/doc/82577596/\" id=\"a_3\"> S.115</a> of\nthe Code of Civil Procedure  to  stay  the  trial  of  the  suits\npending resolution  of  the  disputes  by  the  arbitration.   On\ncontest all  those  applications  were  dismissed.      Aggrieved\ndefendants  preferred CMAs 96, 97, 98 and 101/99 as stated supra,\nwhich also met the same fate.    Aggrieved  over  the  same,  the\ndefendants have brought forth the other four CRPs 529, 1343, 2371\nand 2375/2001.  Since all the said revisions have culminated from\na  common  judgment by the court below, on request by the learned\ncounsel for both sides, all the revisions  were  heard  together,\nand the following order shall govern all the revisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">        3.   Arguing  for the petitioners/defendants, the learned\ncounsel Mr.  Irwin Aaron would submit that the lower courts  were\nnot   correct   in  dismissing  the  applications  filed  by  the\ndefendants seeking stay of all further proceedings in  the  suits\npending  resolution  of  the  disputes by the arbitration, and in    \ngranting    interim    injunction    in     favour     of     the\nrespondents/plaintiffs;  that  under  <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_4\">S.45</a> of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act (Act  34/96),  the  jurisdiction  of  the  civil\ncourts  were restricted to decide about the validity or otherwise\nof the arbitration agreement between  the  parties,  and  if  the\narbitration  agreement  was  valid and the disputes raised in the\nsuit were covered by the arbitration clause, the courts  have  no\ndiscretion  but to refer the disputes to the arbitration; that it\nis pertinent to note that  the  memorandum  of  settlement  dated        \n29.5.98  was  to  be  treated  as  one arising out of the earlier  \ncontracts between the parties, and the said  contracts  contained\nan  arbitration agreement to resolve all the disputes arising out\nof the contracts by arbitration; that the said agreement was  not\nnull  and  void  or  incapable  of  performance;  that under such\ncircumstances, the lower courts should have stayed the hearing of\nthe suit and referred the parties to  arbitration  in  terms  and\nconditions  of the sales contract between them; that the disputes\nraised by the respondents in the suit were  covered  by  a  valid\narbitration agreement between the parties; that the said disputes\nwere  to  be resolved by arbitration, as mutually agreed upon and\nwhen <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 45</a> of Act 34/96 is mandatory and makes it obligatory\nupon the court to pass an order staying  the  legal  proceedings,\ncommenced  by  a  party  to the agreement, the trial court was in     \nerror  in  dismissing  the  applications  for   stay,   and   the\nconfirmation  of  the same by the appellate forum was also wrong;\nthat it is not correct to state  that  the  jurisdiction  of  the\ncivil  court could not be presumed to be taken away and the civil\ncourt alone  can  decide  the  dispute  as  to  the  validity  or\notherwise  of  the memorandum of settlement of contract, when Act\n34/96 was a complete code by itself providing  for  all  possible\ncontingencies  and  the  jurisdiction  of  the  civil courts were\nrestricted and powers have also been conferred on the arbitration\nto decide all disputes inclusive of their own jurisdiction;  that<a href=\"/doc/310829/\" id=\"a_6\">\nS.5</a>  of  Act  34/96  provides that in all matters governed by the\nsaid Act, no judicial authority shall intervene in  the  arbitral\nprocess  except  so  provided  in  the Act, when particularly the            \narbitral proceedings were commenced in accordance  with  a  valid      \nand  enforceable  agreement  to  resolve the disputes between the\nparties, and hence the proceedings should have been stayed by the\nlower court; that under  <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_7\">S.16</a>  of  the  said  Act,  the  arbitral\ntribunal  was  competent  to  rule  on  its own jurisdiction with\nrespect  to  the  existence  and  validity  of  the   arbitration      \nagreement,  and can make a decision rejecting the plea of want of\njurisdiction and can continue with its proceedings  and  pass  an\naward,  and  the  party  if aggrieved by such an award could only\ntake out an application for setting aside the award  as  provided\nunder  the Act; that it is pertinent to note that the objects and\nscheme of Act 34/96 was to achieve speedy settlement of  disputes        \nand  minimizing  the  intervention  of  courts  in  the  arbitral      \nprocess; that when <a href=\"/doc/354344/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> <a href=\"/doc/310829/\" id=\"a_9\">5</a> of the Act was identical with  <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_10\">S.3</a>\nof Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement Act) of 19612, the\nlower court should not have relied on the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court  reported in AIR 1985 S.C.  1451, interpreting<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_11\"> S.34</a>\nof Act 10/40 and holding that the disputes could not  be  decided\nby  arbitration  when  particularly  <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_12\">S.34</a>  of  Act  10/40 was not\nidentical with<a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_13\"> S.45</a> of Act 34/96 bu t  modeled  in  the  UNCITRAL  \nmodel law; that the Supreme Court of India while interpreting S.3\nof  the  Foreign  Awards  Act in the latter part of the very same\njudgment, has held that there was nothing in the general  law  of\narbitration  either  in  English or Indian Law which prevents the\narbitrators or an umpire from deciding the question of their  own\njurisdiction  provisionally or technically and to proceed to make\ntheir awards on that  basis,  though  it  was  clear  that  their\nprovisional  or  tentative  decision  on  questions  of their own\njurisdiction would be subject to the final determination  by  the\nCourt;  that the learned District Judge should not have confirmed\nthe order of injunction granted by the trial  court  against  the\ndefendants  from  claiming  relief  under the sales contract when\nparticularly the arbitral proceedings were commenced prior to the\nplaintiffs filing the suits; that under<a href=\"/doc/55568/\" id=\"a_14\"> S.8(3)</a>  of  the  Act,  an\narbitral  tribunal  can continue with its proceedings and pass an\naward notwithstanding the pendency of the legal proceedings; that\nthe  trial  court  had  no  jurisdiction  to  pass  an  order  of\ninjunction  and continue the suits when the arbitral tribunal has\nseized of the disputes under a valid agreement to resolve all the\ndisputes inclusive of the disputes raised by the  respondents  in\nthe  suits  by  arbitration; that the order of injunction granted\nagainst the first petitioner was without  jurisdiction,  and  the\nsame was non-est in law; that the plaintiffs were not entitled to\nthe relief claimed in the suits, much less an interim relief when\nit  has  not  approached the court with clean hands on account of\nits collusion with one of the employees  of  the  defendants  and\nmanipulated  the  memorandum  of cancellation of the contract and\nsuppression of the initiation of the arbitration  proceedings  by\nthe  first  petitioner prior to the institution of the suits when\nparticularly the relief claimed in the suits  were  discretionary\nin  nature;  that when it was agreed between the parties that the\nforum of  arbitration  was  Liverpool  and  the  arbitration  was\ngoverned by the bye-laws of the Liverpool Cotton Association Ltd,\nthe  courts  in India have no jurisdiction to decide the disputes\nraised by the plaintiffs in the suits, and the orders  passed  by\nthe  lower  court  were  liable  to  be  set  aside  for  want of\njurisdiction; that in view of the plaintiffs relying on the award\nof the arbitral tribunal dated 8.12.1998 and filing the same into\nthe court,  the  plaintiffs  have  waived  its  rights  to  raise\nobjections,  if  any,  for the arbitral tribunal proceedings with\nits proceedings irrespective of an order of injunction passed  by\nthe  court,  and  hence  the  order of the learned District Judge\nconfirming the order of the trial court has got to be set  aside,\nand the applications filed by the petitioners for stay have to be\nallowed  and the applications filed by the respondents/plaintiffs   \nfor interim injunction have got to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">        4.   Countering  to  the   above   contentions   of   the\npetitioners&#x27;  side,  the  learned Senior Counsel Mr.T.R.Rajagopal\nrepresenting Mr.T.R.  Rajaraman, for the respondents would submit\nthat the trial court was perfectly correct in granting the  order\nof  temporary injunction in favour of the respondents restraining\nthe  petitioners-defendants  from  treating  the   contracts   as\nsubsisting  or  making  or enforcing any claim thereunder pending\ndisposal of the suits, and in dismissing the  applications  filed\nby  the  petitioners  defendants  for  stay  of the suits pending\nresolution  of  the  disputes  by  the  arbitration;   that   the\nplaintiffs companies to meet the cotton requirements of its mills\nfor  the  year  1998  required  to  import  cotton;  that  it had\ndiscussions  with  the  Senior  Manager  of  the  defendants  and      \nfinalised  the  same  as  to  its  requirements  and  price,  and\nconsequently, the second  defendant  gave  its  final  offer  for\nsupply,  which was accepted by the plaintiffs; that the contracts\nwere signed  by  the  plaintiffs  and  forwarded  to  the  second   \ndefendant;  that subsequent to the finalisation of the contracts,\nnumber of communications were exchanged  between  the  plaintiffs     \nand  the  second  defendant  who was acting as agent of the first\ndefendant; that during the third week of May 1998, the plaintiffs\ncontacted Mr.Subramaniam of the second  defendant  and  expressed         \nthat  the  contracts  could  be  settled  at  par  in view of the\nworsening textile scenario; that  the  said  Subramaniam,  Senior\nManager  after  consultation  with  the  Directors  of the second       \ndefendant, replied that the contracts could be cancelled  if  the\nplaintiffs   paid   100/150   pts/lb;   that  after  getting  the\nconfirmation from the plaintiffs, the said  Subramaniam  reverted\nback  stating  that  the  Directors  of  the second defendant had \nsecured  the  consent  of  the  first  defendant  for   effecting       \nsettlement,  and consequently, on 29.5.98, the plaintiffs and the\nsecond defendant acting as  the  agent  of  the  first  defendant\nrepresented  by  its  Senior  Manager  Mr.Subramaniam, executed a \nmemorandum of settlement at  Coimbatore  agreeing  and  recording        \nthat  the  contracts  entered  into  between  the  parties  stood\ncancelled at par without any costs to either parties; that  while\nthe   said   contract  was  cancelled  under  the  memorandum  of\nsettlement dated 29.5.98, ignoring the same, the second defendant\naddressed a reminder to the plaintiffs to open a letter of credit\nin  respect  of  the  contracts  already  cancelled;   that   the\nplaintiffs  drew  the  attention  of  the second defendant to the\nmemorandum of settlement already executed; that the contention of\nthe defendants that there was total lack of knowledge  about  the\nmemorandum  of  settlement  and  lack  of  authority  to the said    \nSubramaniam to execute such  a  settlement,  was  only  an  after       \nthought;  that  it is pertinent to note that the second defendant\nhad all along acted on behalf of the  first  defendant,  and  the\nfirst  defendant  has  also  allowed  the  second defendant to be\nrepresented by the second defendant  all  along,  and  thus,  the\nfirst  defendant  was  estopped from denying the authority of the\nsecond defendant; that it remains to be stated  that  the  Senior\nManager  Mr.Subramaniam  of  the  second  defendant  who  had the              \nauthority to represent, had made it clear to the plaintiffs  that\nthe  consent  of  the Directors of the second defendant was taken\nprior to the execution of the memorandum of settlement, and  also\ninformed  that  the  Directors had in turn secured the consent of\nthe first defendant, and thus the memorandum of settlement having\nbeen validly executed, the  contention  of  the  defendants  that\nthere  was  lack of knowledge and lack of authority in the matter\nof execution of the memorandum of settlement has to be  rejected;\nthat the said memorandum of cancellation was executed by a Senior \nManager  for  and  on behalf of the second defendant, who was the      \nagent of the  first  defendant;  that  the  disputes  as  to  the\ncancellation  of the contracts cannot be referred to arbitration,\nas contended  by  the  petitioners&#x27;  side;  that  the  rules  and\nbye-laws  of  Liverpool Cotton Association Ltd have not been made\napplicable  to  the  contracts;  that  the  cancellation  of  the\ncontracts  was  by  a  subsequent  memorandum of settlement which  \ncontained no provision for arbitration and  which  was  not  made \nsubject  to  any arbitration to the Liverpool Cotton Association;\nthat the questions as to whether the memorandum of settlement was \nbinding or not on the parties  and  whether  the  Senior  Manager\nMr.Subramaniam  had  any  authority  to enter into the settlement    \nwere all to be necessarily decided by the Civil Court at the time\nof trial; that it was a matter  of  evidence  and  proof  at  the\ntrial;  that  the  petitioners were not entitled to and they were\nnot justified in seeking any  decision  on  those  issues  before\ntrial;  that  after  memorandum  of cancellation was entered into      \nbetween the parties, now the petitioners cannot be  permitted  to\nsay  that  there  was  collusion  with  ex-employee of the second \ndefendant; that the  alleged  resignation  of  Mr.Subramaniam  on\n8.6.98  could  not affect a valid settlement already entered into\nbetween  the  parties,  even  on  29.5.98  and  that  too   after     \nconsultation   and   after  securing  the  consent  of  both  the\ndefendants; that since the cancellation was  by  mutual  consent,        \nafter  consultation with both the petitioners, the defendants are\nnow making an attempt to set aside the memorandum of  settlement,  \ncancelling the contracts by putting forth false allegations; that\nif they desired to do so, they should take a separate proceedings\nwhich  they  had  not  done,  and the same cannot be an issue for\narbitration, and thus the memorandum of settlement  was  separate\nand  subsequent  agreement  without any provision for arbitration    \ntherein, and if the  settlement  was  to  be  questioned  by  the\ndefendants, the civil court was the only forum which could decide\nthose  issues;  and  that  those  disputes  cannot  be decided by\narbitration proceedings.    Added  further  the  learned   Senior\nCounsel  that  <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_15\">S.45</a>  of  the Act is not applicable to the present     \nfacts of the case, in view of the proviso to the said Section and\nin view of the fact that the contracts between the  parties  have\nalready   been   cancelled  by  way  of  a  valid  memorandum  of\ncancellation; that in view of all the  above,  the  lower  courts\nwere  perfectly  correct  in dismissing the applications for stay\n\n\nand granting interim injunction  in  favour  of  the  respondents\nplaintiffs,  and  hence the orders of the lower courts have to be\nsustained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">        5.  After careful consideration of the rival submissions,\nand scrutiny of the available materials on hand, the court is  of\nthe view that these revisions are devoid of merits.  All the said\nfour  suits  were filed by the respondents-plaintiffs seeking for\ndeclaration  that  the  memorandum  of  settlement  between   the        \nplaintiffs and the second defendant in respect of their contracts\nwere  valid  and  binding  on  the  defendants,  and  the earlier\ncontracts entered into between them  did  not  subsist,  and  for\nconsequential permanent injunction.  At the time of filing of the\nabove  four  suits, the said four interlocutory applications were\nfiled by the respondents/plaintiffs seeking temporary  injunction\nto  restrain  the  petitioners/defendants  from treating the said\ncontracts  as  subsisting  or  making  or  enforcing  any   claim\nthereunder pending  the  disposal  of  the suits.  On enquiry all\nthese four applications were  allowed  and  the  resultant  civil\nmiscellaneous  appeals preferred before the first appellate forum\nwere also dismissed.  The said  four  interlocutory  applications\nwere filed by the petitioners-defendants as stated supra, seeking\nto  refer  the  disputes  between the parties to Liverpool Cotton\nAssociation Ltd for arbitration and stay all further  proceedings\nin  the  suits pending resolution of the disputes by arbitration.\nOn contest,  all  those  applications  were  dismissed,  and  the\nappeals   preferred   therefrom   by  the  defendants  were  also      \ndismissed. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">        6.  Admittedly, the petitioners company, a  part  of  the\nSakthi  Group  textile  Division,  in  order  to  meet the cotton\nrequirement of their mills,  had  negotiations  with  the  Senior\nManager  of  the  second defendant company by name Mr.Subramaniam            \nfor supply of West African Cotton.  Following  an  offer  by  the\nsaid Senior Manager representing the principal, an acceptance was\nmade  and  contracts were entered into between the plaintiffs and\nthe second defendant.  According to the  plaintiffs,  before  the\ncontracts   could  be  performed,  they  desired  to  settle  the\ncontracts in view of the crisis in the textile scenario, and  the\nsame  was  informed  to  the  said  Senior  Manager of the second       \ndefendant, and with the consent of the first  defendant  and  the\nconcurrence  of  the  Directors of the second defendant, the said\nSenior Manager having authority  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  \nsettlement  wherein all the earlier contracts were cancelled, and\nhence in view of the cancellation of the earlier contracts by the\nsaid memorandum of cancellation, the  earlier  contracts  entered\ninto  between  the  parties  seized  to exist, and the defendants\ncould not enforce the terms and conditions therein, and  in  view\nof  the  cancellation of the earlier contracts and in the absence\nof any arbitration clause in the memorandum of cancellation,  the\ndisputes  between  the  parties  could  not  be  referred  to the\narbitration proceedings.    The  contention  put  forth  by   the\npetitioners/defendants  seeking  direction  of the court to refer   \nthe matter to arbitration and to stay all further proceedings  of\nthe suits, is that the original contracts had a clause wherein it\nwas  specifically  agreed  that  the disputes between the parties\nshould be referred to arbitration; that the alleged memorandum of\nsettlement has to be treated as a part of and one arising out  of\nthe  earlier  contracts  between  the  parties,  and  hence it is\nimmaterial that the memorandum did not contain any clause in that\nregard, and apart from that the said memorandum  of  cancellation      \nwould  not be binding on the defendants, since there was thorough\nlack of knowledge of the same, and the same was executed  by  Mr. \nSubramaniam  who  had  no  authority  to  do so, and who has also\nsubsequently resigned from the job, and hence  it  would  not  be\nbinding;  that  in view of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_16\">Arbitration Act</a>,\nthe  disputes  have  got  to  be  necessarily  referred  to   the\narbitration   proceedings;   that  the  defendants  have  already\nreferred the matter to arbitration; that an award was  passed  in\nfavour  of  the plaintiffs; and that the same was also challenged\nbefore the Tribunal wherein the award passed  by  the  arbitrator\nwas  set aside, and an award in favour of the defendants has been\npassed, and if the plaintiffs were aggrieved by  the  same,  they\nshould  have  taken appropriate steps to set aside the award, and\nnot by way of filing the suits and getting an order of injunction\nlike this.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">        7.  It  is  not  disputed  that  the  original  contracts\nenterred  into  between  the  parties  contained  an  arbitration    \nclause, according to  which,  any  dispute  arising  between  the\nparties  was  to  be  decided by the Liverpool Cotton Association\nLtd, having its registered office in England.  Relying on S.45 of\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Act 34/96),  the  learned\ncounsel  for  the  petitioners  would  stress that so long as the       \narbitration agreement was valid and the disputes  raised  in  the\nsuits  were  covered  by the arbitration clause, the court should\nhave referred the parties to the arbitration.    Relying  on  the\nproviso  to  the  said  Section,  the  learned  counsel  for  the      \nrespondents would  submit  that  though  the  original  contracts        \ncontained  an  arbitration  clause,  the subsequent memorandum of\ncancellation did not contain  any  such  clause,  and  hence  the\nearlier  contracts containing the arbitration clause is not valid\nand also  incapable  of  being  performed.    It  would  be  more\nappropriate and advantageous to reproduce<a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_17\"> S.45</a> of the Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act,  1996,  which  runs  thus:   &quot;45.  Power of\njudicial  authority  to  refer  parties  to   arbitration:-   Not\nwithstanding anything contained in Part I or in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_18\">the Code of Civil\nProcedure</a>, 1908 (V of 1908), a judicial authority, when seized of\nan  action  in a matter in respect of which the parties have made\nan agreement referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 44</a>, shall, at the request  of\none  of  the parties or any person claiming through or under him,\nrefer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that  the  said\nagreement  is  null  and  void, inoperative or incapable of being\nperformed&quot; From the very reading of the  provision  it  would  be\nclear that the judicial authority when seized of an action in the\nmatter  in respect of which the parties have made an agreement to\nrefer to in <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 44</a>, shall, at the request of the one  of  the\nparties  or  any  person  claiming through or under him refer the\nparties to arbitration.  Since it is  not  in  dispute  that  the\noriginal  contracts  between the parties contained an arbitration\nclause to refer the dispute that arose  between  the  parties  to      \narbitration.    In   the   instant  case,  as  contended  by  the\ndefendants&#x27; side, in order to decide the dispute, the court below\nmight have referred the parties to the arbitration, but the  same\nwas   possible  provided  the  original  contract  containing  an\narbitration clause was in force and in subsistence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">        8.  It is pertinent to note that in the instant case, the\ncase of  the  respondents/plaintiffs  is  that  a  memorandum  of  \ncancellation  was  entered into between the parties, by which all\nthe original contracts stood cancelled, and thus it would be very\ndifficult  to  appreciate  or  accept  the  contentions  of   the\npetitioners&#x27; side  as put forth above.  It is not disputed by the\npetitioners&#x27; side that the second defendant was acting  as  agent\nof  the  first  defendant;  and  that  the  said  Subramaniam who\nexecuted the  said  memorandum  of  cancellation,  was  a  Senior        \nManager  of the second defendant, and he could well represent the      \nsecond defendant at the time of the execution  of  the  document. \nIt  is  pertinent  to note that the said Subramaniam has resigned\nhis job only subsequent to the execution of the  said  memorandum  \nof cancellation.    The  contention of the petitioners&#x27; side that\nthere was lack of knowledge on its part as to the cancellation of\nthe earlier contracts and the said Senior Manager Subramaniam did\nnot have authority, though he  represented  during  the  relevant\ntime  to  execute  such  a  memorandum of cancellation, cannot be \naccepted.  It is true that the provision under<a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_21\"> S.45</a> to refer  the\nparties to   arbitration  is  mandatory.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1780449\" id=\"span_1\">But,  this  mandatory \nprovision cannot be applied to those contracts, if they are  null\nand void,  inoperative or incapable of being performed.  The case \nof the plaintiffs in the  instant  case  is  that  the  contracts\nbetween  the  parties  were  put  an  end  to  by a memorandum of      \ncancellation, and thus it has become inoperative and incapable of\nbeing performed.  At this juncture, the learned counsel  for  the\npetitioners  would  urge  that the question as to the validity or\notherwise of  the  memorandum  of  cancellation  of  the  earlier\ncontracts   could   also  be  well  decided  in  the  arbitration\nproceedings, and hence that cannot be the reason  for  the  Civil\nCourt to  take  up  the matter and try the same.  The Bombay High \nCourt had an occasion to consider the question  whether  a  party       \ncould  invoke  the  arbitration  clause contained in the original\ncontract, when there is no arbitration clause in  the  subsequent\nM.O.U.   putting  an  end  to  the  original  contract, in a case\nreported in AIR 1997 BOMBAY 337 (<a href=\"/doc/1780449/\" id=\"a_22\">LLOYDS STEEL INDUSTRIES  LIMITED         \nV.  OIL &amp; NATURAL GAS CORPORATION LTD.</a>).  Following the decisions       \nof  the  Apex Court rendered in 1) 1995 SUPP (3) SCC 324; 2) 1994 \nSUPP (3) SCC 126; 3) AIR 1974 SC 15 8; 4) AIR 1959 SC 1362 and 5)   \n(1942) AC 356, the Bombay High Court has  held  in  the  decision        \ncited supra,  thus:    &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_23\">Arbitration  and Conciliation Act</a> (1996).\nSs.11, 16-Contract with arbitration clause    Applicants&#x27;  bills\ninvolving  huge amount withheld for about 4-1/2 years  Applicant\nsuffering huge losses and  was  under  grave  economic  duress \nApplicant  agreeing to enter into MoU whereby claim was fully and\nfinally settled and applicant accepting payment   Dispute  about\nclaim for interest for delayed payments  Held MoU had put an end \nto  the  original  contract  and  the  applicant could not invoke\narbitration clause contained in it   Question  whether  MoU  was  \nvoid  or  not  on ground of economic duress and whether there was\nunjust enrichment could not be decided in these proceedings.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">        11.  Further, the question which would be required to  be\ndecided  is  whether  the  Agreement  referring the matter to the    \nArbitrator is in existence or not.  It has been contended by  the\nApplicant  that  the aforesaid question is required to be decided\nby arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration Act.  To\nthis contention it has been pointed out  that,  before  referring\nthe  matter  for  arbitration,  the  Court  is required to decide\nwhether there is any Arbitration Agreement subsisting or existing\nbetween the  parties.    If  there  is  no  existing  arbitration\nagreement,  then there is no question of referring the matter for\narbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">        12.  It has  been  submitted  that  similar  question  is\nconcluded  by the Supreme Court and that this Court has to decide\nwhether arbitration agreement  is  in  existence  or  not  before\nreferring the   matter  for  arbitration.    If  the  arbitration\nagreement is not in existence, there is no question of  referring\nthe matter  to the arbitral Tribunal.  Reference would be without\njurisdiction.  Friday, 11th July, 1997.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">        13.   In  the  case  of  Damodar  Valley  Corporation  v.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">K.K.Kar,  reoported  in  (1974)  1 SCC 141:(AIR 1974 SC 158), the \nSupreme Court considered the situation when arbitration clause in\nthe contract would survive and  cases  where  arbitration  clause\nwould perish  with  a  new contract.  The Court held as under (at\np.161 of AIR):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;As the contract is an outcome of the  agreement  between\nthe parties it is equally open to the parties thereto to agree to\nbring it to an end or to treat it as if it never existed.  It may\nalso  be  open  to the parties to terminate the previous contract\nand substitute in its place a new contract or alter the  original\ncontract in  such  a  way  that  it cannot subsist.  In all these\ncases,  since  the  entire  contract  is  put  an  end  to,   the\narbitration  clause,  which  is a part of it, also perishes along\nwith it.  <a href=\"/doc/595325/\" id=\"a_25\">Section  62</a>  of  the  Contract  Act  incorporates  this\nprinciple  when  it  provides  that  if the parties to a contract\nagree to substitute a new contract or to rescind or alter it, the\noriginal contract need not be performed.  Where,  therefore,  the\ndispute  between the parties is that the contract itself does not\nsubsist either as a result of its  being  substituted  by  a  new\ncontract  or  by rescission or alteration, that dispute cannot be\nreferred to the arbitration  as  the  arbitration  clause  itself\nwould peris  h if the averment is found to be valid.  As the very\njurisdiction of the arbitrator is dependent upon the existence of\nthe arbitration clause under which he is appointed,  the  parties\nhave  no  right  to  invoke  a  clause  which  perishes  with the\ncontract.  Thereafter, the Court in paragraph 9 referred  to  the\nprinciples stated  in  Heyman&#x27;s  case  ((1942)  AC  356).    Lord\nMacmillan pointed out at page 370 as under :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        &quot;If it appears that the dispute is whether there has ever\nbeen a binding contract  between  the  parties,  such  a  dispute\ncannot  be  covered  by  an  arbitration clause in the challenged\ncontract.  If there has ever been a contract at  all,  there  has\nnever been  as part of it an agreement to arbitrate.  The greater\nincludes the less.  Further, a claim to set aside a  contract  on\nsuch  grounds  as  fraud, duress or essential error cannot be the\nsubject matter of a reference under an arbitration clause in  the\ncontract sought  to  be  set aside.  Again, an admittedly binding\ncontract containing a general arbitration  clause  may  stipulate\nthat in  certain  events the contract shall come to an end.  If a\nquestion arises whether the contract has for any such reason come\nto an end, I can see no reason  why  the  arbitrator  should  not\ndecide that  question.    It is clear, too, that the parties to a\ncontract may agree to bring it to  an  end  to  all  intents  and\npurposes and  to  treat it as if it had never existed.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_2\">In such a\ncase, if there be an  arbitration  clause  in  the  contract,  it\nperishes with  the  contract.    If  the parties substitute a new\ncontract  for  the  contract  which  they  have  abrogated,   the\narbitration  clause  in  the abrogated contract cannot be invoked\nfor the determination of questions under the new agreement.   All\nthis  is  more  or less elementary.&quot; (Emphasis supplied) Further,\nthe Court referred to the principles laid  down  by  the  Supreme\nCourt in  the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_26\">Union of India v.  Kishorilal Gupta</a>, AIR\n1959 SC 1362, for deciding whether contract perishes or  subsists\nwhich are as under (at p.1370 of AIR):</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        &quot;(1)  An  arbitration  clause  is a collateral terms of a\ncontract  as  distinguished  from  its  substantive  terms;   but\nnone-the-less   it  is  an  integral  part  of  it;  (2)  however\ncomprehensive the terms of an  arbitration  clause  may  be,  the\nexistence  of  the  contract  is  a  necessary  condition for its\noperation; it perishes with the contract; (3) the contract may be\nnon est in the sense that it never came legally into existence or\nit was void ab  initio;  (4)  though  the  contract  was  validly\nexecuted,  the  parties  may  put an end to it as if it had never\nexisted and substitute a new contract  for  it  solely  governing\ntheir  rights and liabilities thereunder; (5) in the former case,\nif  the  original  contract   has   no   legal   existence,   the\narbitrationclause   also  cannot  operate,  for  along  with  the\noriginal contract, it is also void; in the altter  case,  as  the\noriginal  contract  is  extinguished  by the substituted one, the\narbitration clause of the original contract perishes with it; and\n(6)  between  the  two  falls  many  categories  of  disputes  in\nconnection  with a contract, such as the question of repudiation,\nfrustration, breach etc.  In those cases it is the performance of\nthe contract that has come to an end, but the contract  is  still\nin  existence for certain purposes in respect of disputes arising\nunder it or in connection with it.  As the contract subsists  for\ncertain  purposes,  the arbitration clause operates in respect of\nthese purposes.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">        14.  In the aforesaid decision in the case of  Kishorilal\n(AIR  1959  SC  1362),  the  Court  interpreted the clause in the\nsecond contract which provided as under:        &quot;The     contract\nstands  finally  determined  and  no  party will have any further\nclaim against the other.&quot; The Supreme Court held that, in view of\nthe aforesaid new contract, the arbitration clause  contained  in\nthe old contract perished.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">        15.   The principle of law that, where parties put an end\nto a contract as if it had never  subsisted  and  substituted  it\nwith  a  new contract governing the rights and obligations of the\nparties thereunder, the arbitration clause  also  perishes  along\nwith  it,  was  accepted as a correct principle in the said case.\nIn the case of Damodhar Valley (AIR 1974 SC 158), the  Court  was\nnot  concerned with the question whether there had been novation,\nrescission or substitution of the contract, but the question  was\nwhether  there  had  been  a  settlement of all claims arising in    \nconnection with a contract which postulates the  existence  of  a\ncontract.   In  that  case,  the  court  observed that accord and\nsatisfaction does not put  an  end  to  the  arbitration  clause.\nHence,  the  Court  held that, in the circumstances, the question\nwhether the termination was valid or not and whether damages  are\nrecoverable  for  such  wrongful  termination does not affect the\narbitration clause or the right of the Respondent  to  invoke  it\nfor appointment of Arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">        16.   From  the aforesaid discussion it is clear that the\nparties can put an end to a contract as if it had never subsisted\nand can substitute it with a new contract governing their  rights\nand obligations.    In such a case, the arbitration clause in the\noriginal contract perishes.  In  such  a  case,  the  arbitration\nclause in the substituted or abrogated contract cannot be invoked\nfor  the  determination  of the questions under the new agreement\nfor a claim to set aside a contract on the grounds such as fraud,\nduress or coercion.  Once the contract is substituted  by  a  new\ncontract, the old contract does not subsist.  In a contract which\nis  substituted or abrogated, the parties have no right to invoke\nthe clause which has perished with the contract.  In such a case,\nthere is  no  question  of  appointing  arbitrator  as  the  very\njurisdiction of the Arbitrator is dependent upon the existence of\nthe arbitrator clause.  &quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        9.   In  view of the decisions of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court,\nwhich were followed by the Bombay  High  Court  in  the  decision        \ncited  supra,  it  is crystal clear that if there was no existing\narbitration agreement between the parties, there was no  question\nof  referring  the  matter  for  arbitration;  that if the entire\ncontract between the parties was put an end to,  the  arbitration\nclause  which was a part of it, also perished along with it; that\nif the earlier contract containing an arbitration clause has been\nabrogated, the party should not be permitted to take the  benefit\nof   the   arbitration  clause  in  the  abrogated  contract  for\ndetermining the question under the new agreement;  and  that  the\nclaim   of   the  defendants  to  set  aside  the  memorandum  of\ncancellation on the ground of any of the invalidating  factors  c\nannot  be  referred  to  as  a subject matter of reference to the\narbitration proceedings and in  view  of  an  arbitration  clause\nwhich has already been put an end to.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        10.  In view of the available materials, it could be well\nstated  that  the  plaintiffs/respondents  had a prima facie case\nthat  the  contracts  entered  into  between  the  parties   were\nterminated  by a subsequent memorandum of settlement entered into  \nbetween them.   The  question  whether  the  said  memorandum  of \nsettlement  is  true,  genuine  and  valid,  as  contended by the\nplaintiffs&#x27; side, or whether it was tainted by  any  one  of  the\ninvalidating  factors  put forth by the defendants&#x27; side could be\ndecided only by evidence at the time  of  the  trial.    At  this\njuncture,  it remains to be stated that even for that purpose, in\nview of the aforestated decisions,  the  matter  has  got  to  be\nnecessarily  tried and decided by a civil court and cannot at all\nbe referred to the arbitration.  The learned District  Judge  was\nnot correct in stating that the memorandum of settlement was only\na  continuation of the earlier contracts between the parties, and\nhence she was not inclined to accept the contention put forth  by\nthe  plaintiffs&#x27;  side  that  the question as to the validity and\nbinding nature of the memorandum of settlement cannot be  treated\nas  the  dispute  arising  out  of  the  earlier contracts, which\ncontained provision of  arbitration  so  as  to  refer  the  said\nquestion  for  arbitration  as  per  Liverpool Cotton Association\nRules.  If the subsequent memorandum of settlement is found to be\ntrue and valid, the earlier contracts between the  parties  would\ncome  to  an end by the execution of the memorandum of settlement \nitself and the same would perish the earlier contracts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        11.  From the available materials and submissions made by\nthe counsel for respective sides,  it  could  be  seen  that  the\narbitration award as evidenced by Ex.A12 was made after the order\nof interim  injunction was passed.  The court is of the view that\nthe said award is of no legal consequence for two reasons.    The\ncivil  court  was  well vested with the jurisdiction to deal with\nthe matter under the facts and circumstances  of  the  case,  and\nthus  the subject matter could not be referred to for dissolution\nof the disputes by an arbitrator.  That  apart,  the  said  award\nunder  Ex.A12  was  passed  by  the  arbitrator  when the interim\ninjunction was in force.  The contention of the petitioners&#x27; side\nthat though the memorandum of  settlement  did  not  contain  any\nprovision  for  arbitration,  the  truth and validity of the said\nmemorandum of settlement could also be decided by the  arbitrator\nor   the  arbitral  tribunal  where  the  arbitration  award  was\nchallenged cannot be countenanced, since it was a question which,\nin view of the decisions  cited  supra,  has  to  be  exclusively\ndecided by a civil court and not under arbitral proceedings.  The\nDistrict  Court  was not correct in accepting the award passed by\nthe appellate authority, as an additional evidence in  the  civil\nmiscellaneous appeal.   The court is able to see suffice force in\nthe objection that was raised by the  plaintiffs&#x27;  side  for  the\nreceipt of  the  same as an additional evidence.  Since the award\npassed by the appellate authority was only in continuation of the\noriginal award, the application for receipt of the award  by  the\nappellate  authority  should  have  been rejected, in view of the\nfact  that  the  original  award  was  passed  in  the   arbitral\nproceedings, at a time where an interim injunction was in force.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        12.   For the foregoing reasons, the court is of the firm\nview that  if  a  temporary  injunction  as  sought  for  by  the\nrespondents/plaintiffs    is    not    granted,    and   if   the\npetitioners/defendants were allowed to proceed to  enforce  their\nclaims  based  on  the earlier contracts, pending the suits, much\nprejudice would be caused to the  respondents/  plaintiffs.    In\nview  of  the  facts and circumstances of the case and in view of\nthe decisions cited supra, the trial  court  has  to  necessarily\nproceed  with  the  suits  and decide the controversy between the     \nparties regarding the subsistence of the earlier contracts and as\nto the truth, genuineness  and  validity  of  the  memorandum  of\ncancellation,  relied on by the respondents/plaintiffs, and hence\nthe stay of the trial of the proceedings should not  be  granted.\nThus,  the orders of the lower courts granting interim injunction\nin favour of the plaintiffs  in  the  interlocutory  applications\npending  the  suits  and dismissing the applications filed by the    \ndefendants to refer the dispute between the parties to  Liverpool\nCotton  Association  Ltd  for arbitration and to stay all further\nproceedings in the suits pending resolution of  the  disputes  by\narbitration have  to  be  sustained.   Therefore, all these civil\nrevision petitions are liable to be dismissed as devoid of merits\nwhatsoever.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        13.   In  the  result,  all  the  eight  civil   revision\npetitions  are  dismissed,  confirming  the  orders  of the lower\ncourts.  There shall be no order as to the costs.
