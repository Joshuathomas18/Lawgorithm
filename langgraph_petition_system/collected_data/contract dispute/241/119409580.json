Indiabulls further stated that\n                         insofar as, the Work Order dated 18.10.2012 is concerned, the said\n                         Work Order did not include any arbitration clause. Further the amount\n                         payable under the said Work Order had been paid and its obligations in\n                         respect of the said Work Order stood discharged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">                         11.

In addition, it is stated that it had no connection with the\n                         Letter of Intent dated 14.01.2014 for construction of 4 RCC Bridges, as\n                         the same was issued by another company - IIC Limited. Elena stated\n                         that IIC Limited was neither a sister concern nor an associate of Elena.\n                         Further, it was not a group company or a subsidiary of Indiabulls.\n                         Similarly, it disputed that it had any concern with the Work Order dated\n                         18.10.2012 issued by Indiabulls for arranging DG Sets. Elena further\n                         alleged that Shapoorji was in breach of its obligations under the\n                         Contract(s) and had failed to complete the construction work within the\n                         time, as stipulated. It also sets out its claim against Shapoorji. It also\n                         stated that the said reply be treated as its notice of invocation of\n                         arbitration in respect of all the claims under the LoA dated 06.02.2010\n                         and the Contract dated 26.03.2010.

Second, he submitted that the revised offer made by\n                         Shapoorji to Indiabulls was a part of the BTG Contract and the said offer\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                              Page 6 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">RAWAL</span>\n                          was obviously, accepted by Indiabulls as Elena could not have\n                         independently accepted the revised offer that was not made to it. Since\n                         there is no dispute that Shapoorji&#x27;s offer to Indiabulls was accepted and\n                         the said offer formed a part of the contract, it was not open for Elena to\n                         contend to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                         15.    Next, he submitted that in terms of the BTG Contract, the Bank\n                         Guarantees for due performance of the works were issued by Shapoorji.\n                         However, they were not in favour of Elena but in favour of Indiabulls.\n                         This also indicated that, Indiabulls was the true beneficiary of the works\n                         contracted to Shapoorji. In addition, the Free Issue Material was to be\n                         made at the rates approved by Indiabulls.        The payments for the\n                         contracts were made directly by Indiabulls to Shapoorji. He submitted\n                         that in the circumstances, even though Indiabulls had not signed the\n                         BTG Contract, it would nonetheless, be bound by the arbitration clause.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">                         16.    He submitted that the BTG Contract also included a clause which\n                         contemplated an obligation to perform extra works. He submitted that\n                         the Work Order for the BoP Works was issued in respect of work\n                         relating to the coal handling plant, which was an integral part of the\n                         Project and thus was required to be construed as extra work under the\n                         BTG Contract. He submitted that the works to be executed under the\n                         BoP Work Order were supplemental to the BTG Works and thus, were\n                         clearly a part of the BTG Contract. He also pointed out that the BoP\n                         Work Order used the terms &#x27;Contractor&#x27;, &#x27;Engineer In Charge&#x27; and also\n                         contemplated &#x27;Owner&#x27;s Approval&#x27;. He submitted that none of those\n                         terms were defined under BoP Contract but were defined under the BTG\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                              Page 7 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">RAWAL</span>\n                          Contract.

He submitted that the\n                         parties always conducted themselves in a manner so as to accept\n                         arbitration as a one-step method of resolving their, inter se, disputes. It\n                         would not make any commercial sense for the parties to agree to refer\n                         disputes regarding the main contract to arbitration and not include\n                         disputes regarding the supplemental and connected contracts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">                         17.    Mr Jain, learned senior counsel appearing for Indiabulls\n                         submitted that Indiabulls was not a signatory to the BTG Contract and,\n                         therefore, could not be compelled to arbitrate. He further submitted that\n                         the notice invoking arbitration was a composite notice in respect of four\n                         separate contracts and thus, the same was invalid. He submitted that\n                         since the contracts were independent, a composite notice could not be\n                         issued. He submitted that Elena was an EPC Contractor and Indiabulls\n                         had entered into three separate Contract Agreements, all dated\n                         25.03.2010, with Elena. One was for awarding the civil and related\n                         works at the project; the second was for supply of equipment and\n                         materials for the project; and, the third, for erection, testing,\n                         commissioning and handing over the project.

There is no dispute that the BTG Contract was signed by\n                         Shapoorji and Elena. Elena was referred to as the &#x27;Employer&#x27;.

The GCC referred to Indiabulls as the &#x27;Owner&#x27;. Thus, the\n                         essential question to be addressed is whether Indiabulls can be\n                         compelled to arbitrate even though it is not a signatory to the BTG\n                         Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">                         20.

The legislative intent in postulating that an Arbitration\n                         Agreement must be in writing is to ensure that the existence of the\n                         Agreement is not brought into question and the same is firmly\n                         established. Indisputably, arbitration is an alternate dispute resolution\n                         mechanism that rests on consent between the parties. Undeniably, the\n                         rule is that a non-signatory cannot be compelled to arbitrate on the\n                         assumption that the said party has not acceded to arbitration.

In Chloro Controls (supra), the Supreme Court had referred to\n                         two theories that could be applied to compel non-signatories to an\n                         arbitration agreement to arbitrate, as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                  &quot;103.1        The first theory is that of implied consent,\n                                  third party beneficiaries, guarantors, assignment and\n                                  other transfer mechanisms of contractual rights. This\n                                  theory relies on the discernible intentions of the parties\n                                  and, to a large extent, on good faith principle. They apply\n                                  to private as well as public legal entities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                                  103.2       The second theory includes the legal\n                                  doctrines of agent-principal relations, apparent authority,\n                                  piercing of veil (also called &quot;the alter ego&quot;), joint venture\n                                  relations, succession and estoppel.

According to Gary B.

(see\n                         International Commercial Arbitration, Volume I, (Third Edition), p.\n                         1531).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                         25.    In several cases, implied consent is used as a basis to hold that\n                         non-signatories are bound by the arbitration agreement. It is well settled\n                         that in cases where the signatory is an agent of the principal (non-\n                         signatory), the principal can be compelled to arbitrate even though it is\n                         not a party to the agreement. This rests on the principle that the\n                         arbitration agreement may not have been signed by the non-signatory\n                         but was executed on its behalf. This principle is applied, essentially, in\n                         cases where the agent-principal relationship is established between the\n                         signatory and non-signatory and it is established that the signatories had\n                         acted under the authority of the principal. There are several cases where\n                         the Courts have found the conduct of the signatory and its principal to\n                         be sufficient evidence of their relationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                         26.    The Courts/Arbitral Tribunals have also in some cases imputed\n                         implied consent on the part of the non-signatory and held the non-\n                         signatory to be bound by the arbitration agreement.

Similarly, an\n                               arbitration agreement is also governed by the same principles,\n                               and normally, the company entering into the agreement,\n                               would alone be bound by it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                               10.3.

However, this is coupled with the condition that such\n                         benefit should be direct and not indirect.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                              Page 23 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">RAWAL</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                          43.     In the present case, Indiabulls (and not Elena) had invited offers\n                         for BTG Works. Shapoorji had submitted its bid (revised offer) directly\n                         to Indiabulls pursuant to the invitation issued by Indiabulls. The said bid\n                         was accepted and such acceptance constituted a binding contract.\n                         Concededly, on Shapoorji&#x27;s bid (revised offer) being accepted, it was no\n                         longer open for Shapoorji to resile from its commitments. In this view,\n                         there is ample evidence to show that Indiabulls had directly participated\n                         in the negotiations and formation of the contract for execution of the\n                         BTG Works even though it was not a signatory to the BTG Contract that\n                         was executed subsequently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_48\">                         44.    There is also ample material on record to show that Indiabulls had\n                         a direct involvement in the BTG Contract. It is not disputed that in terms\n                         of Clause 6 of the LoA, Shapoorji was obliged to provide Bank\n                         Guarantees to Indiabulls. It is also not disputed that in terms of the LoA,\n                         Shapoorji had furnished Bank Guarantees against the advances received\n                         as well as a Performance Bank Guarantee and the same were in favour\n                         of Indiabulls and not Elena. Thus, Indiabulls had secured itself against\n                         performance of the BTG Contract by Shapoorji.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">                         45.    It is also not disputed that Indiabulls had directly issued Letters\n                         of Credit to Shapoorji and made certain payments to Shapoorji, which\n                         were due under the BTG Contract. In the given facts, this Court finds it\n                         difficult to accept that Indiabulls can avoid its obligation to arbitrate\n                         even though it has been a direct beneficiary of the BTG contract and to\n                         some extent been directly involved with Shapoorji in negotiating and\n                         execution of the contract.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                               Page 24 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">RAWAL</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">                          46.

In that case, the question was\n                         of interpreting the arbitration agreement between the parties, which has\n                         been set out in paragraph 4 of the aforesaid decision and reads as follows:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                               4. The petition is countered on behalf of the respondent who\n                               opposes the same on account of maintainability. According\n                               to the respondent, only the rules of arbitration of the\n                               International Chamber of Commerce would apply in\n                               accordance with the agreement between the parties.

If we see the language of <a href=\"/doc/705639/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 23.1</a> in the light of\n                               <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 22.1</a>, it is clear that the parties had agreed that the\n                               disputes arising out of the agreement between them would be\n                               finally settled by the arbitration in Seoul, Korea. Not only that,\n                               but the rules of arbitration to be made applicable were the\n                               Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. This gives\n                               the prima facie impression that the seat of arbitration was only\n                               in Seoul, South Korea. However, Ms Mohana, learned counsel\n                               appearing on behalf of the petitioner drew our attention to the\n                               bracketed portion and contended that because of the bracketed\n                               portion which is to the effect &quot;or such other place as the parties\n                               may agree in writing&quot;, the seat could be elsewhere also. It is\n                               based on this that Ms Mohana contended that, therefore, there\n                               is no express exclusion of <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_36\">Part I of the Act</a>. It is not possible to\n                               accept this contention for the simple reason that a bracket\n                               could not be allowed to control the main clause. The bracketed\n                               portion is only for the purposes of further explanation. In my\n                               opinion, Shri Gurukrishna Kumar, learned counsel appearing\n                               on behalf of the respondent, is right in contending that the\n                               bracketed portion is meant only for the convenience of the\n                               Arbitral Tribunal and/or the parties for conducting the\n                               proceedings of the arbitration, but the bracketed portion does\n                               not, in any manner, change the seat of arbitration, which is only\n                               Seoul, Korea.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">                         52.    It can be discerned from the aforesaid decisions that words,\n                         clauses or a sentence appearing in parenthesis are inserted in a passage\n                         as an explanation, which is otherwise also, grammatically complete\n                         without it. In other words, the purpose of a parenthesis is ordinarily to\n                         insert an illustration, explanation, definition or additional piece of\n                         information of any sort in a sentence that is logically and grammatically\n                         complete without it. The clause clearly indicated that the formal contract\n                         would be with Indiabulls. This court is of the view that mentioning Elena\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                                 Page 30 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">RAWAL</span>\n                          between brackets was done to indicate that Indiabulls and Elena were\n                         one and the same. Thus, the formal contract with Indiabulls may be\n                         entered by Elena. The facts and circumstances also bear out that Elena\n                         is an Alter-Ego of Indiabulls.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">                         53.

In view of the above, there is material on record to impute that\n                         Indiabulls is a party to the arbitration agreement. There is also merit in\n                         Mr Mukhopadhyay&#x27;s contention that since Shapoorji had made a revised\n                         offer to Indiabulls and it is not disputed that the same was accepted, it\n                         must follow that the resultant contract was also made with Indiabulls.\n                         Clearly, a third party cannot accept an offer to constitute binding\n                         contractual obligations and it is not disputed before this Court that the\n                         LoA did give rise to a contract that bound Shapoorji to the terms\n                         contained therein. The LoA was accepted by Shapoorji. Thus, it also\n                         agreed to the terms thereof which are stated above, which included a\n                         specific condition that it would enter into a formal contract agreement\n                         with Indiabulls.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">                         55.

The Final Bill for the BTG Contract was also submitted to\n                         and received by Indiabulls. It is not the case of Indiabulls that it had\n                         objected to Amendment No.21 at any time during the execution of the\n                         BTG Works or thereafter.

Deloitte Haskins Sells: 9 F.3d 1060 (2d Cir. 1993)], the\n                         court held that a non-signatory can be compelled to arbiter under\n                         equitable estoppel principles, because it received a copy of the contract,\n                         did not object to it, offered no persuasive reason for its inaction and\n                         knowingly accepted benefits of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">                         59.    The next aspect to be examined is whether the relationship\n                         between Indiabulls and Elena and their conduct, is sufficient to compel\n                         Indiabulls to be a party to the arbitration regarding the disputes raised\n                         by Shapoorji. In this regard, it is not disputed that Elena is a wholly\n                         owned subsidiary of Indiabulls. Indisputably, Elena is a separate legal\n                         entity by virtue of it being incorporated as a company. However, it is\n                         well settled that the corporate veil can be pierced in certain\n                         circumstances as noticed hereinbefore. In the present case, Shapoorji\n                         had claimed that Elena was a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for\n                         executing the Project. Therefore, it had no other purpose but to facilitate\n                         setting up the Thermal Power Plant. Although, this averment was\n                         denied by the respondents; they have not produced any material which\n                         would effectively counter the said assertion. There is no assertion that\n                         Elena is engaged in any other business other than its participation in\n                         execution of the projects for Indiabulls. This Court is inclined to accept\n                         the contention that Elena is a Special Purpose Vehicle and it would be\n                         apposite to treat Elena as an extended division of Indiabulls as it is not\n                         involved in any other business other than executing the projects for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                               Page 36 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">RAWAL</span>\n                          Indiabulls. Although it is contended that Elena is an independent\n                         contractor and was awarded three separate contracts by Indiabulls, there\n                         is no material on record to indicate that Elena and Indiabulls function as\n                         independent and separate organisations. On the contrary, there is\n                         material to indicate that Elena is not organized and staffed separately\n                         and is independent of Indiabulls.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">                         60.    It was also pointed out that one Mr Shanker Dutt who was the\n                         General Manager of Indiabulls, had issued the Work Completion\n                         Certificate for both the BTG and BoP Works on behalf of Elena. He\n                         had also signed a letter dated 24.01.2017 as an authorized signatory of\n                         Indiabulls. It does appear that Indiabulls and Elena share common\n                         resources. It is also seen from the affidavits placed on record that both\n                         Indiabulls and Elena share a common office space (at A-49, Ground\n                         Floor Road No. 4, Mahipalpur, New Delhi-110037). Further as\n                         mentioned above, the LoA was issued on the letterhead mentioning\n                         Indiabulls even though it was signed on behalf of Elena. It would be\n                         reasonable to draw an inference that Elena also used stationery which\n                         prominently mentions &quot;Indiabulls&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">                         61.

Supp. 1400, 1406 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), the court considered a\n                         construction case involving a foreign project where the sub-contractors\n                         sought to compel the American corporate parents to enter arbitration\n                         abroad of a dispute involving claims against the main contractor. The\n                         Court considered that the allegations that the parent corporation\n                         exercised dominance and control over the main contractor were\n                         sufficient to &quot;state a claim for alter ego liability&quot; even in the absence of\n                         any allegation of fraud. The relevant extract of the said decision is set\n                         out below:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                                    &quot;The petition is replete with allegations that defendants\n                                    exercised dominance and control over TEA, and that\n                                    TEA was under-capitalized. Those allegations are not\n                                    sufficient of themselves to &quot;pierce a corporate veil&quot; so\n                                    as to visit upon parent corporations the obligations of a\n                                    subsidiary.

It alleges that the subcontract\n                                    between plaintiff&#x27;s and TEA obligated TEA to make\n                                    certain payments to plaintiffs upon termination of the\n                                    main contract; and that defendants decided that TEA\n                                    would breach those obligations, sending implementing\n                                    instructions to TEA.

These allegations,\n                                    even in the absence of allegations of fraud requiring\n                                    Rule 9(b) particularity, are sufficient to state a claim for\n                                    alter ego liability.

In Thomson-CSF, S.A. v. American Arbitration Association: 64\n                         F.3d 773 (2d Cir. 1995), it was held that the corporate parent must exert\n                         a degree of control over the subsidiary that there is abandonment of\n                         separate corporate structures, intermingling of corporate finances and\n                         directorship and in essence, the subsidiary must cease to function as a\n                         distinct entity.

Serv. 1218 (2d Cir.\n                         1991), the Court listed some grounds on which piercing the corporate\n                         veil would be justified, such as, where the parent and subsidiary are run\n                         by common officers, do not deal at arm&#x27;s length with each other, are not\n                         treated as separate profit centres and share common office space. The\n                         law in this regard has been summarised in ARW Exploration Corp. v.\n                         Aguirre: 45 F.3d 1455 (10th Cir, 1995), where the Court held that &quot;a\n                         corporation will be bound to arbitrate when it is merely the &quot;alter ego&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                         of an individual or previously established corporation that has entered\n                         into the arbitration agreement&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">                         65.    Given the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the\n                         view that it would be apposite to compel Indiabulls to arbitrate as there\n                         is sufficient material to show that Elena is its alter ego. This is evident\n                         from the fact that Elena&#x27;s name has been mentioned in parenthesis\n                         against the name of Indiabulls in the LoA. The shareholding pattern\n                         confirms that Indiabulls does exercise complete control as a shareholder\n                         over Elena. The fact that the officials of Indiabulls acted on behalf of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                               Page 39 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">RAWAL</span>\n                          Elena also indicate that Indiabulls exercises substantial and dominant\n                         direct control over the affairs of Elena.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">                         66.    In addition, Indiabulls has a direct involvement in the BTG\n                         Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">                         67.     Shapoorji has raised claims against Indiabulls as well as Elena.\n                         These claims arose from the same contract (BTG Contract). Clearly, this\n                         Court is unable to hold that, Shapoorji&#x27;s claim that Indiabulls is liable to\n                         pay its dues, is unsubstantial or frivolous and should be rejected at the\n                         threshold. In the circumstances, rejecting Shapoorji&#x27;s prayer to compel\n                         Indiabulls to arbitrate would effectively relegate Shapoorji to institute\n                         separate proceedings against Indiabulls on the same cause of action.\n                         This would not be an apposite recourse and the cause of action cannot\n                         be split. Considering the above, and the fact that Indiabulls was directly\n                         involved in the contract, this Court is of the view that Indiabulls should\n                         also be referred to arbitration for adjudication of the subject disputes\n                         relating to or arising from the BTG Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">                         68.     Insofar as the BoP Works is concerned, it is admitted that the said\n                         contracts for plant works were awarded to another agency (Gannon\n                         Deunkerley Co.

The remaining part of the BoP Work was thereafter awarded to\n                         Shapoorji. It appears that quotes were invited from Shapoorji and a\n                         Work Order was issued. Admittedly, that was not a part of the BTG\n                         Contract as initially awarded but a part of a separate contract awarded\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">Digitally Signed         ARB .P. 716/2019                                                Page 40 of 42</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">By:DUSHYANT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">RAWAL</span>\n                          to Gannon Dunkerley &amp; Co.

It is also important to note that the amounts due against the BoP\n                         Works were not included in the Final Bill for the BTG Contract.\n                         Shapporji had submitted a separate Final Bill for the BoP Contract and\n                         therefore the contention that works executed under the BoP Contract,\n                         should be considered as additional items under the BTG Contract cannot\n                         be readily accepted. In this view, this Court is unable to accept that an\n                         agreement exists between the parties for referring the disputes relating\n                         to the BoP Contract to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"121987320\" id=\"span_169\">70.
