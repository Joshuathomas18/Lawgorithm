The 1996 Act\n                covers all kinds of disputes including the dispute relating to\n                work contracts. In our opinion, the 1983 Act and the 1996\n                Act can be harmonised by holding that the 1983 Act only\n                applies where there is no arbitration clause but it stands\n                impliedly repealed by the 1996 Act where there is an\n                arbitration clause. We hold accordingly. Hence, the\n                impugned judgment cannot be sustained and we hold that\n                the application under Section 9 of the 1996 Act was\n                maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">                4.

This Court\n\n     speaking through S.B. Sinha J. (as he then was) after going through the various\n\n     provisions of the MP Act, 1983, observed that the said legislation was a special\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9740 of 2022                             Page 16 of 64</span>\n\f   Act that was enacted for providing compulsory arbitration on disputes to\n\n   which the State Government or a public undertaking (wholly or substantially\n\n   owned or controlled by the State Government), is a party, and for matters\n\n   incidental thereto or connected therewith. It observed that the MP Act, 1983\n\n   postulates creation of a separate forum for the purpose of determination of\n\n   disputes arising inter alia out of the works contract. The Madhya Pradesh\n\n   Arbitration Tribunal established thereunder, is not a domestic or an ad hoc\n\n   arbitral tribunal, by virtue of the unique scheme of provisions that govern its\n\n   framework. The members of the MP Arbitral Tribunal are not nominated by\n\n   the parties, the Tribunal has the power to reject a reference for arbitration; it\n\n   has the power to suo-motu summon records; take note of evidence; award\n\n   costs and interests. The Chairperson of the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal has\n\n   the power to refer disputes to another bench. It contains provisions,\n\n   prescribing a special time-limit and procedure for the passing of an award and\n\n   for its subsequent challenge, respectively. Accordingly, this Court held that\n\n   the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_49\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> (for short, the “Act, 1940”) and the\n\n   Act, 1996 would have no application to arbitrations governed by the MP Act,\n\n   1983 or any award passed thereunder.

The Members\n           of the Tribunal are not nominated by the parties. The\n           disputants do not have any control over their appointment.

In VA Tech (supra) the short point that fell for the consideration of this Court\n\n   was whether, an application under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 9</a> of the Act, 1996 could be said to\n\n   be maintainable, where the arbitration proceedings were governed by the MP\n\n   Act, 1983. In other words, where the dispute had to be resolved by way of\n\n   arbitration in terms of the MP Act, 1983, more particularly <a href=\"/doc/961785/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 7(1)</a>,\n\n   thereof, could the Act, 1996 be said to also be applicable simultaneously or\n\n   alternatively for such disputes. This Court held that since both the MP Act,\n\n   1983 and the Act, 1996 respectively were similar in nature inasmuch as both\n\n   provided frameworks for resolution of dispute by way of arbitration, any\n\n   potential conflict or overlap in their application ought to be construed\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9740 of 2022                            Page 19 of 64</span>\n\f   harmoniously. This Court observed that the gravamen of Section 7 of the MP\n\n   Act, 1983 which provided for reference to arbitral tribunal was only to make\n\n   arbitration compulsory for resolving disputes arising out of work contracts\n\n   involving either the State Government or a Public Undertaking of Madhya\n\n   Pradesh. As per VA Tech (supra) what has been conveyed in so many words\n\n   by the plain language of Section 7 of the MP Act, 1983 is only to mandate\n\n   arbitration in respect of such work contracts, and the said provision by no\n\n   means in the opinion of this Court was intended to override any legislation\n\n   enacted by the Parliament, be it the Act, 1996 (sic or the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_69\">Arbitration Act,\n\n   1940</a>). As per VA Tech (supra), Section 7 of the MP Act, 1983 cannot be\n\n   construed to oust the application of Act, 1996 to the arbitration clauses which\n\n   are otherwise governed by the provisions of the said Act. Accordingly, it held\n\n   that the MP Act, 1983 would apply only to the disputes pertaining to work\n\n   contracts as aforementioned which do not contain an arbitration clause i.e.,\n\n   where the Act, 1996 is otherwise inapplicable. In all other disputes, where the\n\n   work contract contains an arbitration clause, the Act, 1996 would be\n\n   applicable and the MP Act, 1983 inapplicable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1189990\" id=\"span_44\">8.

It provides for a\n                  reference and the Tribunal has been given the power of\n                  rejecting the reference at the threshold. It also held that\n                  the M.P.

It further observed that although the Act, 1996 came into\n\n          force after the MP Act, 1983 yet there is nothing to indicate that the Act,\n\n          1996 either expressly or impliedly has repealed the MP Act, 1983.

Both the Acts operated in view of\n                  Section 46 of the 1940 Act. The M.P. Act, 1983 was\n                  reserved for the assent of the President and admittedly\n                  received the same on 17-10-1983 which was published\n                  in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette Extraordinary dated 12-\n                  10-1983. Therefore, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 254(2)</a> of\n                  the Constitution was satisfied. Thus, the M.P. Act of\n                  1983 prevails in the State of Madhya Pradesh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">                  Thereafter, the AC Act, 1996 was enacted by Parliament\n                  repealing the earlier laws of arbitration of 1940. It has\n                  also been noted that the <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_117\">AC Act, 1996</a> saves the\n                  provisions of the M.P.

Therefore, there cannot be any\n                  repugnancy.

This is clear from <a href=\"/doc/72836326/\" id=\"a_121\">Sections 2(4)</a> and\n                  <a href=\"/doc/546849/\" id=\"a_122\">2(5)</a> of the AC Act, 1996. Therefore, there is no\n                  substance in the argument of repugnancy and is\n                  accordingly rejected.”\n                                              (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9740 of 2022                            Page 27 of 64</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166421160\" id=\"span_64\">12.However, Gyan Sudha Misra J. in her dissenting opinion in <a href=\"/doc/166421160/\" id=\"a_123\">L.G.

She observed that a reference to arbitration under the MP Act,\n\n   1983 postulates two requirements, namely; (i) the existence of a ‘works\n\n   contract’ involving either the State Government or a Public Undertaking of\n\n   Madhya Pradesh and (ii) that such contract pertains to the execution of any of\n\n   the work enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/121249/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 2(i)</a> thereof. <a href=\"/doc/121249/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 2(i)</a> in turn lays down in\n\n   explicit terms as to the nature and scope of “works contract” by enumerating\n\n   the specific nature of disputes that would be covered, i.e., “work relating to\n\n   construction, repair or maintenance ... supply of goods or material and all\n\n   other matters relating to the execution of any of the said works”. However,\n\n   since Section 2(i) of the MP Act, 1983 only covers specific and well-defined\n\n   ‘works’ and is applicable only in respect of disputes pertaining to its\n\n   execution, and does not include disputes of repudiation, cancellation or\n\n   termination of such works, the legal and logical consequence of the aforesaid\n\n   would be that, insofar as the dispute is not of the nature enumerated in Section\n\n   2(i) of the MP Act, 1983, such dispute would be outside the jurisdiction of the\n\n   M.P.

From this provision it is clearly\n           apparent that reference of any dispute to the Tribunal\n           postulates an existence of a works contract and in the definition\n           of “works contract” under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Arbitration\n           Tribunal Act, 1983, it has clearly and unequivocally been\n           specified as to what is a “works contract” in relation to which\n           the dispute is required to be referred in writing to the Tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">                             xxx              xxx      xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">           48. Thus, on a perusal of the definition of “works contract”, it\n           is manifestly clear that while the “works contract” means an\n           agreement pertaining to matters relating to the execution of\n           any of the work enumerated in the definition of “works\n           contract”, the same does not include the dispute pertaining to\n           termination, cancellation or repudiation of works contract and\n           the entire nature of transaction laid down therein relates to\n           disputes which arise out of execution of the nature of work\n           specified in the “works contract”. However, the question\n           whether the “works contract” has been legally repudiated and\n           rightly cancelled or not is the question or dispute pertaining to\n           termination of works contract and has not been incorporated\n           even remotely within the definition of “works contract”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">           49. In view of this, the legal and logical consequence which\n           can be reasonably drawn from the definition of “works\n           contract” would be, that if there is a dispute between the\n           contracting parties for any reason relating to works contract\n           which include execution of any work relating to construction,\n           repair or maintenance of any building or superstructure, dam,\n           weir, canal, reservoir, tank, lake, road, well, bridge, culvert,\n           factory, workshop, powerhouse, transformers or such other\n           works of the State Government or public undertaking including\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9740 of 2022                            Page 29 of 64</span>\n\f           an agreement for the supply of goods or material and all other\n           matters relating to the execution of any of the said works, the\n           same would fall within the ambit of the definition of “works\n           contract” and hence all disputes pertaining to or arising out of\n           execution of the works contract will have to be referred to the\n           M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal as envisaged under Section 7\n           of the 1983 Act.

[...] But the same cannot be allowed to be raised under the\n           M.P. Act of 1983 since the definition of “works contract”\n           unambiguously lays down in explicit terms as to what is the\n           nature and scope of “works contract” and further enumerates\n           the specific nature of disputes arising out of the execution of\n           works contract which would come within the definition of a\n           “works contract”. However, the same does not even vaguely\n           include the issue or dispute arising out of cancellation and\n           termination of contract due to which this question, in my\n           considered opinion, would not fall within the jurisdiction of the\n           M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal so as to be referred for\n           adjudication arising out of its termination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">           52. As already stated, fallout certainly would be otherwise if\n           the matter were to be adjudicated by an arbitrator appointed\n           under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_127\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and that\n           would be in view of the ratio of the decisions of the Supreme\n           Court referred to hereinbefore which has held it permissible\n           for the arbitrator to adjudicate even the dispute arising out of\n           cancellation or termination of an agreement or contract. This\n           however, cannot be allowed to broaden or expand the ambit\n           and scope of the M.P. Act of 1983 where the State Legislature\n           has passed a specific legislation in respect of certain specified\n           types of arbitration determining as to what is the nature of\n           disputes to be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration Tribunal\n           and that specifically permits the reference of dispute arising\n           out of execution of contract but clearly leaves out any dispute\n           arising out of termination, cancellation or repudiation of\n           “works contract”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9740 of 2022                           Page 30 of 64</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\f           53. In order to clarify the point further, what needs to be\n           emphasised is that if the nature of dispute referred to the\n           arbitrator like the instant matter, related to a dispute\n           pertaining to construction, repair, maintenance of any building\n           or superstructure, dam or for the reasons stated within the\n           definition of “works contract”, the matter may be referred to\n           the M.P. Tribunal in view of the fact that if there is a dispute in\n           relation to execution of a works contract, then irrespective of\n           the fact whether the agreement contains an arbitration clause\n           or not, the dispute is required to be referred to the M.P. State\n           Arbitration Tribunal for adjudication. But when the contract\n           itself has been terminated, cancelled or repudiated as it has\n           happened in the instant case, then the nature of dispute does\n           not fall within the definition of “works contract” for the sole\n           reason that it does not include any dispute pertaining to\n           cancellation of a works contract implying that when the works\n           contract itself is not in existence by virtue of its cancellation,\n           the dispute cannot be referred to the M.P. State Arbitration\n           Tribunal but may have to be decided by an arbitrator\n           appointed under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_128\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">           54. Hence, if the nature of the dispute is such which falls within\n           the definition of “works contract” under Section 2(i) of the\n           M.P. Act, 1983 and one of the contracting parties to the\n           agreement is the State of M.P., then irrespective of an\n           arbitration agreement the dispute will have to be referred to\n           the Tribunal in terms of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 7</a> of the Act of 1983. But if the\n           works contract itself has been repudiated and hence not in\n           existence at all by virtue of its cancellation/termination, then\n           in my considered view, the dispute will have to be referred to\n           an independent arbitrator to be appointed under the\n           <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_130\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> since the M.P. Act,\n           1983 envisages reference of a dispute to the State Tribunal only\n           in respect of certain specified types of arbitration enumerated\n           under Section 2(i) of the M.P. Act, 1983.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                             xxx              xxx       xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">           57. Thus, the sum and substance of what I wish to emphasise is\n           that the question as to whether the dispute would be referred\n           to the M.P. Tribunal in terms of Section 7 of the M.P. Act of\n           1983 or to an independent arbitrator under the Arbitration and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Special Leave Petition (C) No. 9740 of 2022                             Page 31 of 64</span>\n\f           <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_131\">Conciliation Act, 1996</a> will depend upon the factum whether\n           the works contract is existing between the parties or not out of\n           which the dispute has arisen. In case, the works contract itself\n           has been repudiated/cancelled, then, in view of its non-\n           existence, Section 7 of the M.P. Act pertaining to reference of\n           dispute to the Tribunal would not come into play at all by virtue\n           of the fact that the dispute relating to execution of works\n           contract alone can be referred to the Tribunal in view of the\n           specific nature of works contract enumerated within the\n           definition of works contract under the Act of 1983. However,\n           when the works contract itself becomes non-existent as a\n           consequence of its cancellation, the matter will have to be\n           referred to an independent arbitrator under the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_132\">Arbitration\n           and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> and not to the M.P.

After the\n           contract granted to the appellant was rescinded, the appellant\n           invoked Section 7 of the 1983 Act by approaching the\n           Arbitration Tribunal. By the order dated 19-4-2010, the\n           Arbitration Tribunal held that in view of the arbitration clause\n           in the contract, the 1983 Act will have no application and the\n           appellant will have to take recourse to the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_234\">Arbitration Act</a>. In\n           view of this order, the appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the\n           High Court under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_235\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Arbitration Act by filing\n           a petition for the appointment of an arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">           7.

The objection based on the\n           applicability of the 1983 Act was not raised. The respondents\n           did not challenge the order of appointment of the arbitrator\n           passed by the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\n           Arbitration Act. Even before the learned arbitrator, <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_237\">Section\n           16(1)</a> of the Arbitration Act was not invoked to raise the\n           jurisdiction issue. However, in the written statement filed\n           before the arbitrator, the contention regarding the\n           applicability of the 1983 Act was raised.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">           9. As noted earlier, in the facts of the case, before taking\n           recourse to the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_238\">Arbitration Act</a>, the appellant had taken\n           recourse to Section 7 of the 1983 Act. The order of the\n           Arbitration Tribunal, holding that the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_239\">Arbitration Act</a> will\n           apply, led the appellant to file a petition under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_240\">Section 11(6)</a> of\n           the Arbitration Act, which was not objected to on the grounds\n           of the applicability of the 1983 Act. The objection of the State\n           Government was confined to the merits of the claim. The award\n           is only in the sum of Rs 6,52,235 with interest. The award was\n           made on 25-4-2014. Therefore, in the facts of the case, it will\n           be unjust to set aside the award only on the ground of the\n           failure of the appellant to take recourse to the 1983 Act.

Even assuming that the observations in para 17 of the\n            decision in M.P.
