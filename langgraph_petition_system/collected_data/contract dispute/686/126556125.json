Petitioner issue LoI to Opposite Party No.3\n                             on 22nd December, 1992, whereas the work order was issued by\n                             OMC on 29th September, 1993. Accordingly, contract was\n                             executed between OMC and Opposite Party No.3 on 13th May,\n                             1994 (Annexure-2). The Opposite Party No.3 failed to achieve\n                             the rated capacity in performance test, i.e., 75 TPH (Ton Per\n                             Hour) and left the work incomplete. In spite of repeated\n                             communications, the Opposite Party No.3 did not comply with\n                             the terms and conditions of the contract. On the other hand,\n                             Opposite Party No.3 claiming to be a Supplier, filed an\n                             application on 27th March, 2006 before the IFC, Thane under\n                             <a href=\"/doc/546282/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 4</a> of the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale\n                             and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 (for brevity\n                             &#x27;IDP Act, 1993&#x27;). The said application was registered as IFC\n                             Case No.1 of 2006 (Annexure-1). It was alleged in the said\n                             application that the OMC failed to clear the bills of the\n                             Opposite Party No.3 from 6th May, 1998 to 17th April, 1999\n                             though the plant in question was handed over to OMC on 11th\n                             April, 1999 and it was provisionally accepted on the said date.\n                             Thus, IFC Case No.1 of 2006 was registered before IFC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">                     4.

Before issuance of notice to the\n                             Petitioner, the IFC should have examined as to whether it had\n                             jurisdiction to entertain an application under the IDP Act, 1993\n                             or not. When the matter stood thus, <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_6\">MSMED Act, 2006</a> came\n                             into force with effect from 2nd October, 2006, but the IFC\n                             assuming jurisdiction under the <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_7\">MSMED Act, 2006</a> acted in\n                             terms of <a href=\"/doc/417937/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 18</a> of the MSMED Act, 2006 and proceeded\n                             with the matter.

When initiation of the\n                             proceeding under the IDP Act, 1993 by the IFC, Thane was\n                             without jurisdiction and a nullity, no action under the <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_10\">MSMED\n                             Act, 2006</a> could have been taken by the said IFC validating an\n                             invalid proceeding.

Thus, its Mr. Nanda, learned Senior\n                             Advocate argued that the Petitioner having afforded ample\n                             opportunity to participate in the conciliation, chose not to avail\n                             the same.

Even thereafter, the\n                             Council provided opportunities to the parties to settle the matter\n                             amicably without involving the Council, which is clear from the\n                             subsequent minutes of the Council dated 1st February, 2014.\n                             However, vide its letter dated 5th May, 2014 (Annexure-R/45 to\n                             the additional affidavit), the Petitioner being not satisfied again\n                             wrote to the Council/Opposite Party No.2 that it lacked\n                             jurisdiction to decide the dispute and requested to decide the\n                             issue of jurisdiction preliminarily. Hearing of matter was then\n                             posted to 21st June, 2014 by the Council. Vide the said notice\n                             under Annexure-R/46 to the additional affidavit, the Petitioner\n                             informed the Council/Opposite party No.2 to decide the issue of\n                             jurisdiction first without which attendance of the Petitioner\n                             should not be insisted upon.

In response to the same, the Petitioner vide its letter\n                             dated 27th August, 2014 (Annexure-R/49 to the additional\n                             affidavit), requested the Council to adjourn the hearing for four\n                             weeks on account of change in the office order of\n                             Chairman/Managing Director. Hence, the matter was then fixed\n                             to 15th November, 2014 under intimation to the parties. When\n                             the matter stood thus, the Petitioner filed the instant Writ\n                             Petition on 14th November, 2014. On the same date, it intimated\n                             to the Council about filing of the Writ Petition. The matter was,\n                             however, taken up on 15th November, 2014 and on conclusion\n                             of hearing in absence of the Petitioner award under\n                             Annexure-10 was passed directing the Petitioner to pay\n                             Rs.45,60,886/- along with interest till the date of payment to\n                             Opposite Party No.3 within a period of one month from the date\n                             of receipt of the award. Thus, the Petitioner moved this Court\n                             for amendment of the Writ Petition to challenge the award,\n                             which was allowed. Mr. Nanda, learned Senior Advocate,\n                             therefore, submitted that since award under Annexre-10 has\n                             already been passed in the IFC Case, the Writ Petition in the\n                             present form is not maintainable.

As narrated above by learned Senior Advocates appearing for\n                           the respective parties and the materials available on record,\n                           there remains no dispute with regard to the factual aspect of\n                           the case. It remains undisputed that the Opposite Party No.3\n                           was awarded with a contract for designing, manufacture,\n                           supply,       search,   erection,   testing,   commissioning   and\n                           performance guarantee test on turnkey basis 75 TPH Crushing\n                           and Spinning Plant at Jajanga, Odisha. There arose some\n                           dispute between the parties for which payment of Opposite\n                           Party No.3 was withheld by Petitioner-OMC. The Opposite\n                           Party No.3 filed a claim petition before the Industrial\n                           Facilitation Council, Thane (IFC) under the provisions of the\n                           IDP Act, 1993, as amended in 1998. The claim petition by\n                           Opposite Party No.3 was filed on 27th March, 2006\n                           (Annexure-1). The said claim petition was registered as IFC\n                           Case No.1 of 2006. On 21st September, 2006, IFC sought for\n                           clarification from Opposite Party No.3 as to whether its claim\n                           was only for interest or for principal amount along with\n                           interest (R-21 to the additional affidavit). The Opposite Party\n                           No.3 clarified the same on 28th September, 2006 stating that\n                           the claim was for principal outstanding, interest as well as for\n                           damages. Thus, the IFC issued notice to the Petitioner on 9 th\n                           November, 2006 (Annexure-3 to the Writ Petition). On receipt\n                     W.P.(C) No.22236 OF 2014\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                                                  Page 23 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\"> Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">Digitally Signed</span>\nSigned by: SASANKA SEKHAR SATAPATHY\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">Reason: Authentication</span>\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA CUTTACK\nDate: 18-Jun-2025 17:47:27\n\n\n\n\n                           of the said notice, the Petitioner, vide its letter dated 13th\n                           December, 2006 (R-24 to the additional affidavit) sought for\n                           extension of two months&#x27; time for filing reply in IFC Case\n                           No.1 of 2006. When the matter stood thus, <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_79\">MSMED Act, 2006</a>\n                           came          into   force   with   effect   from   2nd      October,\n                           2006, vide notification       No.S.O.1154(E)   dated      18th   July,\n                           2006 [see Gazette of India, Extraordinary Part II <a href=\"/doc/657002/\" id=\"a_80\">sec.3(ii)</a>] and\n                           the Council was constituted under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_81\">MSMED\n                           Act, 2006</a>. After the Council was constituted, fresh notices\n                           were issued to the Petitioner and Opposite Party No.3. It is\n                           worthwhile to state here that although the Petitioner had\n                           sought for extension of two months&#x27; time to file its reply, but\n                           no reply was filed for a considerable period. As such, vide\n                           letter dated 4th March, 2013 (Annexure-R-28 to the additional\n                           affidavit), the Council informed the Petitioner that despite its\n                           letter dated 13th December, 2006, no response was received\n                           from the side of the Petitioner. Thus, the Council directed the\n                           Petitioner to file its reply within fifteen days from the date of\n                           receipt of the said letter failing which, it was indicated that the\n                           Council would proceed ex parte in the matter. Reminder to file\n                           objection was also issued to the Petitioner by the Council on\n                           23rd May, 2013 (Annexure-4 to the Writ Petition). On receipt\n                           of the said letter, the Petitioner, vide its letter addressed to the\n                           Council, inter alia, alleged that pursuant to letter dated 9th\n                           November, 2006, learned Advocate appearing for the\n                           Petitioner had visited office of the IFC/Council to verify the\n                           case record and obtain necessary documents during January,\n\n                     W.P.(C) No.22236 OF 2014\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                                                     Page 24 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\"> Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">Digitally Signed</span>\nSigned by: SASANKA SEKHAR SATAPATHY\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">Reason: Authentication</span>\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA CUTTACK\nDate: 18-Jun-2025 17:47:27\n\n\n\n\n                           2007, but the same was found defunct following repeal of the\n                           IDP Act, 1993. No communication by the Council was made\n                           to the Petitioner thereafter. The Petitioner further alleged that\n                           the Council had no jurisdiction to entertain the dispute in view\n                           of the Clause 9.20 of the contract and the dispute was also\n                           barred by limitation. Thus, for the first time, the Petitioner,\n                           vide its letter dated 29th May, 2013, raised an objection with\n                           regard to the territorial jurisdiction of the Council and that the\n                           dispute was barred by limitation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">                   10.1 However, adhering to the request of the Petitioner to provide\n                           another set of claim petition, the Council sent a set of\n                           documents to the Petitioner in respect of the claim petition\n                           dated 13th June, 2013. The Petitioner was also directed therein\n                           to file its reply within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the\n                           documents. On receipt of the said documents, the Petitioner\n                           again requested for one month time with effect from 1st July,\n                           2013 to file its reply (Annexure R-32 to the additional\n                           affidavit). However, vide letter dated 18th July, 2013 (Annexure\n                           R-33 to the additional affidavit), the Council issued notice of\n                           final hearing to the Petitioner intimating that despite several\n                           notices it had not filed its response to the claim petition. Thus,\n                           the Petitioner was directed by the Opposite Party No.2 either to\n                           make payment of the claim amount or to file its reply within\n                           fifteen days of the date of the notice failing which, the Council\n                           would be compelled to proceed with the matter without waiting\n                           for the reply of the Petitioner. On receipt of the same, the\n                           Petitioner filed its preliminary reply on 8th August, 2013\n\n                     W.P.(C) No.22236 OF 2014\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                                                                   Page 25 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\"> Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">Digitally Signed</span>\nSigned by: SASANKA SEKHAR SATAPATHY\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">Reason: Authentication</span>\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA CUTTACK\nDate: 18-Jun-2025 17:47:27\n\n\n\n\n                           (Annexure-5 to the Writ Petition).

Although hearing of the dispute was\n                           scheduled on 11th October, 2013, the Petitioner did not attend\n                           the hearing before the Council. However, the Council informed\n                           the Petitioner that since Opposite Party No.3-Unit is located in\n                           Mumbai and was registered with the Industry Commissioner,\n                           Mumbai, the Council had jurisdiction to entertain the dispute.\n                           Upon receipt of the said letter/notice dated 29th October, 2013,\n                           the Petitioner again raised the issue of jurisdiction of the\n                           Council as well as limitation to file the claim petition.

It was also argued that\n                             <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_110\">MSMED Act, 2006</a> is prospective in nature and its provisions\n                             cannot be retroactive in nature to validate the claim of\n                             Opposite Party No.3 to be entertained by IFC Thane.

By the time the issue of jurisdiction was\n                             raised, the Council was in seisin of the matter. As discussed,\n                             the Council had ample jurisdiction to entertain the claim as\n                             Opposite Party No.3 situates within its local jurisdiction.\n                             Thus, the argument with regard to prospective application of\n                             the provision of <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_112\">MSMED Act</a> in the instant case loses its\n                             significance. Be that as it may, the decision with regard to\n                             jurisdiction of the Council could have been raised in a\n                             properly constituted petition under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 34</a> of the\n                             Arbitration Act, 1996 read with <a href=\"/doc/1565179/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 19</a> of the MSMED\n                             Act, 2006, which the Petitioner has not yet availed. In view of\n                             the above, the objection with regard to jurisdiction raised by\n                             the Petitioner being devoid of any merit stands overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">                     14.

It was argued that\n                             that the preliminary issue, as aforesaid, was raised pursuant to\n                             the 2nd notice dated 23rd May, 2013 issued by the Council. It\n                             is further argued that upon receipt of the claim by the IFC, it\n                             should have made an endeavour to see as to whether it had\n                             jurisdiction to entertain such a claim.

Thus, the same needs no reiteration.\n                             Contention of Ms. Rath, learned Senior Advocate to the effect\n                             that upon receipt of the claim of Opposite Party No.3, the IFC\n                             should have made endeavour to see that whether it had the\n                             jurisdiction to entertain the same or not, this Court observes\n                             that there is no provision under the IDP Act, 1993 or\n                             <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_115\">MSMED Act, 2006</a> obliging the IFC or the Council, as the\n                             case may be, to decide the issue or jurisdiction at the\n                             threshold unless it is raised by the adversary, namely, the\n                             Petitioner. When an application raising such preliminary issue\n                             was filed, the Council observed that it had jurisdiction to\n                             entertain the proceeding.

Ms. Rath, learned Senior\n                             Advocate vehemently argued that the claim petition was filed\n                             by Opposite Party No.3 before <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_122\">MSMED Act, 2006</a> came into\n                             force.

Thus, the Council had\n                             apparently committed no error in holding that it had\n                             jurisdiction to entertain such claim. As such, the argument of\n                             Ms. Rath, learned Senior Advocate that there was no\n                             corresponding provision under the <a href=\"/doc/352833/\" id=\"a_127\">MSMED Act</a> to entertain\n                             such claim is not sustainable. Ms. Rath, learned Senior\n                             Advocate referred to the case law in the case of <a href=\"/doc/184463694/\" id=\"a_128\">Rabinder\n                             Kumar Dhariwal Vs. Union of India</a>; (2023) 2 SCC 209,\n                             which does not deal with a case of the present nature. The\n                             observations made therein are in the context of facts and\n                             circumstances of the said case, which has no application to\n                             the instant case. It is, however, observed in the said case law\n                             that the test to identify two statutes are &#x27;corresponding&#x27; is\n                             whether firstly, subject matter of two statutes is essentially\n                             same and secondly, main object and purpose are substantially\n                             similar. It is further observed therein that the said test,\n                             however, cannot be applied to identify corresponding\n                             provision, since a much more specific analysis will have to be\n                             undertaken. A provision does not correspond to another\n                             merely because it deals with the same subject matter. Rather,\n                             the test would be whether both provisions are essentially\n                             similar or not. In the instant case, core issue to be considered\n                             is whether a claim before the IFC was entertainable or not.</span>\n                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"184463694\" id=\"span_157\">From the observations made in <a href=\"/doc/184463694/\" id=\"a_129\">Rabindra Kumar Dhariwal</a>\n                             (supra), it is apparent that the same requires adjudication, if\n                             raised.

Further, the letters\n                             of Opposite Party No.3 dated 16th February, 2005, 21st\n                             February, 2005, 14th March, 2006, 2nd May, 2005, 22nd June,\n                             2005, 30th July, 2005, 31st August, 2005 and 9th September,\n                             2005 to the Petitioner (Annexure-R/62 series to the additional\n                             affidavit) were not responded by the Petitioner. Apparently\n                             aforesaid series of communications constrained the Opposite\n                             Party No.3 to move the IFC under the IDP Act, 1993. Further,\n                             in the letter dated 26th October, 2013, it is stated for the first\n                             time that although the claim relates to financial year 1999-\n                             2000, the Opposite Party No.3 approached IFC after six years\n                             despite having other fora for redressal of its grievances. No\n                             specific objection with regard to limitation appears to have\n                             been raised by the Petitioner either before the Council or in\n                             the Writ Petition. However, from the series of events, as\n                             discussed above, it cannot be said that the claim of the\n                             Opposite Party No.3 was barred by limitation. Had such an\n                             issue been raised, the Council would have an occasion to\n                             adjudicate the same.

As such, the award, which is stated\n                             to be an outcome of the arbitration proceeding is null and\n                             void. As such, the writ petition is maintainable in view of the\n                             ratio in Jharkhand Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (supra). Mr.\n                             Nanda, learned Senior Advocate for Opposite Party No.3\n                             objecting to the same submitted that after termination of the\n                             conciliation proceeding, vide order dated 18th January, 2014 by\n                             the Council, it had only advised the parties to settle the matter\n                             amicably and inform the Council without involving itself in the\n                             conciliation. The said order can never be construed as a\n                             continuation of the conciliation proceeding, as alleged by the\n                             Petitioner. In order to settle the matter amicably, even after\n                             termination of the conciliation proceeding, the Council\n                             provided another opportunity to the parties to settle the matter\n                             amicably without involving itself. Thus, there was no illegality\n                             on the part of the Council to proceed with the arbitration and\n                             pass ex-parte award under Annexure-10.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">                     19.     Giving an anxious thought to the rival contentions of the\n                             parties, this Court on perusal of records finds that vide order\n                             dated 18th January, 2014, the Council holding that the\n                             Petitioner is not interested in conciliation, terminated the\n                             conciliation proceeding and directed the parties to participate\n                             in the hearing of the case thereby initiating arbitration\n                             proceeding. As such, the ratio of Jharkhand Urja Vikas\n                             Nigam Limited (supra) has no application to the instant case.\n                             Minutes of hearing held on 1st February, 2014, which was\n\n                     W.P.(C) No.22236 OF 2014\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                                                                 Page 41 of 43</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\"> Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">Digitally Signed</span>\nSigned by: SASANKA SEKHAR SATAPATHY\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">Reason: Authentication</span>\nLocation: HIGH COURT OF ORISSA CUTTACK\nDate: 18-Jun-2025 17:47:27\n\n\n\n\n                             communicated to the parties on 7th February, 2014 by the\n                             Council, does not indicate that the Council had taken up the\n                             conciliation proceeding beyond 18th January, 2014. It only\n                             provided another opportunity to the parties, namely, the\n                             Petitioner and the Opposite Party No.3 to settle the dispute\n                             amicably and inform the Council accordingly. Thus, it is clear\n                             from the said order that the Council never involved itself in\n                             taking up the conciliation proceeding beyond 18th January,\n                             2014. As such, the contention of Ms. Rath, learned Senior\n                             Advocate in that regard, is not sustainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">                     20.     An argument was advanced by Ms. Rath, learned Senior\n                             Advocate that no opportunity was given to the Petitioner to file\n                             written statement to the claim of Opposite Party No.3 in the\n                             arbitration proceeding. It was her submission that arbitration\n                             was to be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the\n                             <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_132\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a>. The mandatory provision having not\n                             been followed by the Council while taking up the arbitration\n                             proceeding, the same vitiates the entire arbitration proceeding,\n                             so also the award. Such an argument advanced by Ms. Rath,\n                             learned Senior Advocate is not acceptable, inasmuch as the\n                             legality and propriety of the procedure followed and merit of\n                             the award can only be adjudicated in a properly constituted\n                             proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 read\n                             with <a href=\"/doc/1565179/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 19</a> of the MSMED Act, 2006.
