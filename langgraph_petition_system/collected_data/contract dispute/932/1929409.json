It is further prayed that defendant\nNo.1-vessel  M.T Johar Ex-Vukovar  be ordered to be sold along\nwith her hull, engines, gears, tackles, bunkers, machinery, apparel,\nplant, furnitures, fixtures, appurtenances and paraphernalia and the\nsame be condemned in respect of the claim in the arbitration\nproceeding pending between the parties.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2\tInitially,\nthe plaintiff as well as the defendants filed Civil Application No.96\nof 2011 and Civil Application No.88 of 2011 and both the applications\ncame to be disposed of by this Court by order dated 9th\nFebruary 2011 considering the statement of Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned\nSenior Advocate, that the inter-se claims made by the parties, viz.\nthe plaintiff as well as the defendants shall be referred to\narbitrator as per clause 8 of the Memorandum of Agreement [MOA] dated\n11.12.2010 and the plaintiff was permitted to amend the prayer\nclause.\n</p> \n\n\t\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3\tAlong\nwith the plaint, the plaintiff has annexed list of documents\ncontaining MOA dated 11.12.2010, Letter of Credit opened on\n14.12.2010, compilation of e-mails exchanged between the plaintiff\nand defendant No.2, Notice of Readiness dated 21.12.2010 issued by\ndefendant No.2, the plaintiff s letter dated 21.12.2010 to\ndefendant No.2, MOA dated 11.12.2010 entered into by the plaintiff\nfor purchase of new vessel.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.\tIt\nis the say of the plaintiff that defendant No.1-vessel  M.T Johar\nEx-Vukovar  is registered under the Zanzibar flag until deletion\nand, later on, the  MOA in respect of the vessel dated 11.12.2010 was\namended and it was registered under the Pakistan flag. Pursuant to\nnegotiation between the plaintiff and defendant No.2 for sale of\ndefendant No.1-vessel  M.T Johar Ex-Vukovar  by defendant No.2 in\nfavour of the plaintiff, the parties entered into MOA dated\n11.12.2010  for the sale of defendant No.1-vessel  M.T Johar\nEx-Vukovar  to the plaintiff at the rate of USD 486 per LT. It is\nthe further case of the plaintiff that, as per the terms of MOA dated\n11.12.2010, the light displacement tonnage (LDT) of the vessel  was\nagreed to be 15,636 MT and the vessel was to be delivered at\nKarachi/Gadani Anchorage in Pakistan between 15.12.2010 and\n24.12.2010. Defendant No.2 was required to tender Notice of Readiness\n(NOR) to the plaintiff as and when the vessel was ready  for delivery\nand, along with the vessel, defendant No.2-seller was required to\nprovide amongst other documents an original Trim and Stability\nBooklet (TSB). Accordingly, the plaintiff opened Letter of Credit on\n14.12.2010 and requested the agent of defendant No.2 to provide Trim\nand Stability Booklet (TSB)  when the said booklet, purporting to be\nthe original Trim and Stability Booklet (TSB), provided weight of\ndefendant No.1-vessel  M.T Johar Ex-Vukovar  only 15,463 MT\ninstead of 15,636 MT as agreed upon under MOA dated 11.12.2010 and\nthe plaintiff, who examined Trim and Stability Booklet (TSB),  found\nthat a few pages were not numbered and found to be tampered with. In\nthe meanwhile, exchange of communication in the form of e-mail\nbetween the parties took place. On 21.12.2010, defendant No.2 issued\na notice of readiness along with only one page of Trim and Stability\nBooklet (TSB) showing the weight to be 15,636 MT and, therefore, the\nplaintiff on the very day i.e. 21.12.2010 informed defendant No.2\nthat NOR was not as per the MOA and that there were deficiencies and\nLTD was not as per MOA dated 11.12.2010 and the plaintiff requested\ndefendant No.2 and the Chairman of Pakistan Ship-breakers Association\nto resolve the disputes amicably. The plaintiff suffered losses owing\nto the default committed by defendant No.2 in delivering defendant\nNo.1-vessel  M.T Johar Ex-Vukovar   in accordance with the terms\nand conditions of MOA dated 11.12.2010 and, therefore, a claim is\nmade in this plaint to award USD 3,78,614  with interest @ 18% per\nannum from the date of filing the suit till the date of realization\nagainst the defendants.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">5.\tMr.\nMihir Thakore, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the plaintiff,\nhas taken this Court to various factual aspects as recorded in the\nforegoing paragraphs and submitted that the plaintiff was justified\nin not taking delivery of defendant No.1-vessel  in as much as LTD of\ndefendant No.1-vessel was not as per MOA dated 11.12.2010 and no\noriginal documents including Trim and Stability Booklet (TSB) was\nplaced for the perusal of the plaintiff. It is further stated that\nprior to NOR, various correspondence took place and, in no uncertain\nterms, the plaintiff had pointed out shortfall/deficiency and\nnon-compliance of MOA dated 11.12.2010. Therefore, it cannot be said\nthat the plaintiff has repudiated the contract and only it is a case\nof refusal to take delivery since defendant No.1-vessel was not as\nper the description mentioned in MOA dated 11.12.2010.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.1\tThe\nlearned Senior Advocate appearing for the plaintiff has placed\nreliance on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1504127/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 15</a> of the Sale of Goods Act,\n1930 and submitted that the sale of the vessel was by description\nand, therefore, the action taken by the plaintiff against the seller\nwas for breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price\nas per remedy for breach of warranty provided under <a href=\"/doc/1259095/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 59</a> of the\nsaid Act. As regards pending proceeding of arbitration, it is\nsubmitted that there is no bar for this Court to exercise admiralty\njurisdiction with regard to maritime claim in spite of the fact that\nthe arbitration proceedings are pending. It is submitted that the\nclaim made in this suit cannot be realized or even if any award that\nmay be passed in the arbitral proceeding cannot be enforced against\ndefendant No.2 which has weak financial infrastructure and assets as\nshown in the certificate which referred to cash transaction only.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1147125\" id=\"span_1\">6.\tAt\nthe outset, Mr. K.S. Nanavati,  learned Senior Counsel appearing for\nthe defendants has raised a preliminary contention as to\nmaintainability of the suit in its present form under the Admiralty\njurisdiction of this Court and relied upon the decision dated\n24.1.2011 of this Court in Admiralty Suit No.10 of 2010, confirmed by\na Division Bench of this Court in O.J. Appeal No.6 of 2011, vide CAV\nJudgment dated 17th February 2011,  and submitted that\nthere is no maritime claim and International Convention on the arrest\nof Ships, Geneva, dated March 12, 1999, which mentions about a\ndispute arising out of contract and sale of a ship, is a Convention\nnot ratified by the countries which participated in the Convention\nand, in any case, such Convention is not binding to this country\nsince India was not a signatory. Even no domestic law is enacted by\nthe Parliament to carry out effect and consequence of the Convention\nand, in absence thereof, the maritime claim as raised does not\nrequire any adjudication by this Court. Without admitting anything to\nthe contrary, alternatively, it is submitted that, in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1147125/\" id=\"a_3\">Liverpool and London S.P. &amp; I Association Limited vs. M.V. Sea\nSuccess I and another</a>, reported in (2004) 9 SCC 512, the Apex Court,\nwhile considering the factual aspects of Geneva Convention of 1999,\nultimately, in paragraph 60, held that application of 1999 Convention\nin process of interpretative changes would be subject to [i] domestic\nlaw which may be enacted by the Parliament and [ii] it should be\napplied only for enforcement of a contract involving public law\ncharacter. In this suit, the pleadings, subject matter and nature of\nprayer do not satisfy either of the above conditions and the suit\ndeserves to be rejected on this preliminary ground alone.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.1\tOn\nmerits also,  Mr. K.S. Nanavaty, learned Senior Advocate for the\ndefendants has  resisted the suit on the ground that, since, in view\nof clause 8 of MOA dated 11.12.2010 with regard to arbitration,  the\ndefendants have filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  45</a> of the\nArbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996 for reference of disputes to\narbitration, no relief, as claimed, can be granted to the plaintiff.\nThe learned Senior Advocate for the defendants  has also pointed out\nthe fact that defendant No.1-vessel  M.T Johar Ex-Vukovar  was\nsold by Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, an undertaking of\nPakistan Government, which mentioned  LDT of the vessel as 15636 MT\nand the said weight was shown in MOA dated 11.12.2010 executed with\nthe plaintiff by defendant No.2. The plaintiff accepted the vessel\nwithout inspection and the sale of the vessel was definite and\noutright. The Notice of Readiness (NOR) was served along with Trim\nand Stability Booklet (TSB) and, according to defendant No.2,  on\naccount of refusal to take delivery on the part of the plaintiff, no\nloss can be attributed to the defendants. The learned Senior Advocate\nfor the defendants  has relied upon certain documents including\nminutes of meeting dated 18.12.2010 held between the agent of\ndefendant No.2 where it was unanimously agreed that the weight of the\nvessel was 15650 MT,  Certificate issued by ship s classification\nsociety Bureau Veritas  dated 18.12.2010 certifying that the\nlightweight of the vessel is 15650 MT, and certificate issued by\nAmerican Bureau of Shipping dated 17.12.2010 certifying the LDT to be\n15636 MT,  dead-weight calculation by the builders of the vessel\ndated 21.6.1982 and e-mail dated 20.12.2010 all relating to weight of\nthe vessel as 15636 Mt.   Since the plaintiff refused to take\ndelivery, defendant No.1-vessel sailed to Alang and at present lying\nat Alang Anchorage.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">6.2\tThe\nlearned Senior Advocate for the defendants has vehemently urged that,\nfor the difference in the LDT to the extent of mere 173 MT, the\nplaintiff is not justified in repudiating the contract and the\nconduct of the plaintiff disentitles it from claiming any relief from\nthis Court. It is further submitted that defendant No.2 has several\nassets and it is registered in the State of Texas, USA, and having\ngood business reputation and the certificate issued by State of New\nJersey, Department of Treasury, certifying good standing of defendant\nNo.2 and, therefore, any claim in the nature of present one can be\nrealized of a decree or award being passed and, therefore also, the\nadmiralty jurisdiction of this Court is not to be exercised. The\nlearned Senior Advocate for the defendants has also disputed that \nthe Letter of Credit was opened in accordance with MOA dated\n11.12.2010  and clause 49 of the Letter of Credit did not contain\nsuch confirmation as required by authorized financial institution and\nit contains several discrepancies. Even after negotiation and\nentering into correspondence/communication, the dispute was sought to\nbe resolved, but failed and, therefore, the plaintiff cannot be\npermitted to take advantage of its own wrong under the admiralty\njurisdiction of this Court.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">6.3\tMr.\nK.S. Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the defendants\nhas further contended that the plaintiff has invoked admiralty\njurisdiction of this Court by placing its claim as maritime claim and\nthe only dispute, if any, was about difference of LTD of the vessel\naround 173 MT and, as per the terms of MOA dated 11.12.2010, the\nplaintiff was duty bound and under obligation to accept delivery of\nthe vessel and, for shortfall or lacuna, if any, as per MOA dated\n11.12.2010, the plaintiff could have taken appropriate recourse in\naccordance with law. The action of the plaintiff is nothing, but a\ndeliberate breach of contract and the conduct of the plaintiff has\ngenesis in the international market about sale and purchase of the\nvessel which came down and, to take advantage of such situation, the\nplaintiff refused to take delivery of the vessel. The learned Senior\nAdvocate appearing for the defendants has also relied upon\nrequirement of issuance of NOR and the reply submitted by the\nplaintiff on the same day, i.e. 21.12.2010, and, while relying upon\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_5\">Order 39 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, it\nis submitted that no such eventuality arises and no arrest order is\nnecessary. The learned Senior Advocate appearing for the defendants\nhas also relied upon <a href=\"/doc/980118/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 37</a> of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 with\nregard to delivery of wrong quantity and the decision of this Court\nreported in 1980 GLR 272 [Dudhia Forest Cooperative Society vs.\nMohamed &amp; Co.] in the context of <a href=\"/doc/980118/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 37</a> and submitted that\nthe difference in quantity is not substantial difference and,\ntherefore, the buyer is not justified in resorting to <a href=\"/doc/1851968/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 37(1)</a>\nof the said Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1147125\" id=\"span_2\">It is next submitted that, in any case, the\nplaintiff has no maritime claim and, for a dispute arising out of\ncontract of sale of the vessel, it is at the most a claim for which\nordinary civil remedy may be available and taken recourse of, but, in\nno circumstances, it is in the realm of public law character as held\nin paragraph 60 of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1147125/\" id=\"a_9\">Liverpool</a> [supra]. It is, therefore, submitted that  the present suit\nmay be rejected with costs.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1147125\" id=\"span_3\">7\tIn\nrejoinder, Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned Senior Advocate appearing for\nthe plaintiff, has emphasized and tried to distinguish the nature of\npublic law contract and submitted that, since the remedy is taken\nunder  the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_10\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, subject of the\nplaintiff, the pleading of the suit and the prayer have nexus with\nthe provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_11\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, and\nthat the nature of the suit and the dispute arising out of the\ncontract cannot be said to be a contract arising out of private law\nand the suit is maintainable in view of the judgment of the Apex\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1147125/\" id=\"a_12\">Liverpool</a> [supra]. It is further submitted that \neven International Convention of Brazil of 1952, to which India was\nnot a signatory, was accepted and applied with regard to maritime\nclaim vis-?-vis admiralty jurisdiction and, though various heads of\nmaritime claim being no public law character, but still the Courts\nexercising admiralty jurisdiction have considered the Convention of\n1952 and exercised admiralty jurisdiction.</span>\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1147125\" id=\"span_4\">7.1\tMr.\nMihir Thakore, learned Senior Advocate, appearing for the plaintiff,\nhas relied on <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 7</a> of 1952 Convention with regard to\njurisdiction of the Courts of the country in which the arrest was\nmade with regard to determining the case upon merits on certain\nconditions. Thus, it is submitted that even after the decision of the\nApex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1147125/\" id=\"a_14\">Liverpool</a> [supra] and this Court in\nAdmiralty Suit No.10 of 2010, confirmed in  O.J.

M.V. Sea Success I and Another</a>\n(supra), the Apex Court on the\naspects of Convention has recorded at para 43 about the ratification\nof the Convention of 1999 by various countries and, therefore, it is\nnot possible for us to entertain the contention that the Convention\nof 1999 is not in force or not ratified by the requisite number of\ncountries as per <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> of the Convention of 1999.

This means that both the\nconditions are to be observed while applying the Convention of 1999.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">12\tThe aforesaid\nleads us to examine the question as to whether the contract in\nquestion is involving public law character or not.  The contract in\nquestion for sale of the particular ship is produced by the\nplaintiffs themselves with the plaint at Annexure-A and the same is\nentered into between the plaintiffs and defendant No.3 herein.  It is\npurely a commercial transaction for sale of the ship and, in no way,\nconnected with our nation directly or indirectly, nor is there any\noperation and/or involvement of the State or any instrumentality of\nthe State as per <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India.  The said\ncontract dated 21.8.2008, upon which the reliance has been placed by\nthe plaintiff, in our view would not attract any public law\ncharacter, in any manner, whatsoever.  In our view, the parameters of\nthe contract involving public law character has to be read as per the\nlegal provisions prevailing in our country.  It is by now well\nsettled that the contract may attract public law character, if the\nState or instrumentality of the State, is directly or indirectly\nconnected therewith in enforcement of the contract or implementation\nthereof.  Further, by virtue of the said contract, if there is any\nquestion arises for the sovereignty of the Nation, environment,\npollution, dispute of sea water etc., where larger or huge or any\npublic interest is involved, such contract may also attract public\nlaw character.
