The averments made by the petitioners with respect to petition being\\n                          W.P.(C) 1915/2023 is that the petitioner Nos.1 to 13 have been\\n                          unceremoniously prohibited from contesting the upcoming elections of\\n                          office bearers of respondent No.1-Basketball Federation of India.

It is the case of the petitioners in the petition being W.P.(C)\\n                          1915/2023 that they have been prohibited on a wholly perfunctory and\\n                          hyper-technical ground to contest the election. Their nomination forms have\\n                          been rejected on the ground that they were not submitted in the prescribed\\n                          format. The petitioners state that they had filled up the form, which was\\n                          delivered by respondent No.3/Returning Officer and surprisingly the forms\\n                          given to other contestants were accepted, who belong to the incumbent\\n                          President group. It is submitted that the entire election is sham. Despite the\\n                          fact that there is no essential difference between the form submitted to the\\n                          respondent No.3-Returning Officer and the form notified by respondent No.\\n                          2 in the Model Election Guidelines, en bloc rejection of the nominations has\\n                          been done, which has resulted in exclusion of the contested candidates. The\\n                          petitioners are, therefore, praying for various reliefs.

He submits that\\n                          the scrutiny of nomination paper was to take place on 10.02.2023 at 11:00\\n                          a.m., and the respondent No.3-Returning Officer as per his legal\\n                          understanding found that the nomination form which was submitted by the\\n                          candidates whose nominations have been rejected was distinct and could not\\n                          have been considered to have been substantially complied with the\\n                          requirement under the prescribed format. Therefore, the nomination forms\\n                          have been rightly rejected. According to him, the nomination form which is\\n                          prescribed in Form 2 under National Sports Code of India, 2021 mandates\\n                          that the proposer and the seconder had to nominate the candidate, who in\\n                          turn would give his assent. He explains that in contradiction to requirement\\n                          under Form 2, the candidates whose nomination forms have been rejected\\n                          directly applied for the post and mentioned the name of proposer and the\\n                          seconder at a later stage. The same has been in complete departure from the\\n                          prescribed format and in view of the settled legal principle that a procedure\\n                          once is prescribed in a particular manner, the same has to be done in that\\n                          manner and no other. He further explains that, had the nomination form\\n                          which were not found to have been submitted in prescribed Form 2 were not\\n                          rejected the act of respondent No.3-Returning Officer would have been\\n                          questioned and the same would have invited cause for raising grievance by\\n                          the other candidates. He, therefore, submits that since there is no rule for\\n                          equity in an election and the same has to be strictly in compliance of what is\\n                          prescribed in statute/rule/ bye laws etc.     The decision of rejection of\\n                          nomination form has rightly been taken.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">                          13.

If both the forms are carefully perused, there are few basic\\n                          requirements featured therein. Firstly, there has to be a proposer and the\\n                          seconder. Secondly, there has to be an acceptance by the candidate who\\n                          desires to contest the election. Thirdly, is the name of the proposer and\\n                          seconder must be from the member of „State/Union Territories/Board/\\n                          Institution‟. Fourthly, they all have to sign the nomination form. The\\n                          ancillary requirement is that the nomination form has to be submitted on the\\n                          date declared in the calendar of events and the candidate who desires to\\n                          contest the election must specifically state the post. His name must also be\\n                          found in the Electoral College. In the instant case, the only reason given by\\n                          the respondent No.3-Returning Officer is that there is substantial variation in\\n                          the prescribed Form 2.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">                          25.    Without going into the controversy as to whether the form which was\\n                          supplied by the respondent No.3-Returning Officer itself was filled up and\\n                          submitted by the candidate or the candidates have submitted some different\\n                          form, it would be appropriate to first consider whether the Form 2 which has\\n                          been submitted by the candidates lacks any substantial information or\\n                          suffers with any material illegality so as to result in necessary rejection.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_28\\\">                          26.

The proposer and seconder have proposed\\n                          and seconded and have also signed the form. Whether the name of proposer\\n                          and seconder should come first in order, before the candidate accept his\\n                          nomination prima-facie cannot be said to be a substantial defect to reject the\\n                          nomination form en bloc. If the nomination forms submitted by candidates\\n                          are perused, the same would prima facie indicate that all substantial\\n                          compliances have been made. The form does not lack any of the relevant\\n                          information which was required to have been submitted in Form 2 relied\\n                          upon by the respondent No.3-Returning Officer.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_29\\\">                          27.    While considering the aforesaid controversy, this court may not lose\\n                          the sight of the fact that for various posts in all there were total 30\\n                          nomination forms submitted by different candidates out of which 15\\n                          nomination forms have been rejected only on singular ground and 50%\\n                          contestants stand excluded from election.

It is thus seen that in the instant case there is no election with respect\\n                          to officer bearers of respondent No.1-Federation. What remains to be done\\n                          on 18.02.2023 is to issue the Form 15 i.e. formal declaration of results. The\\n                          declaration of result as can be seen has practically taken place on\\n                          13.02.2023, while declaring the candidate as unopposed deemed elected.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_30\\\">                          Therefore, the declaration in Form 15 is only a formality and on 18.02.2023\\n                          there is going to be no election. For all practical purposes, so called election\\n                          stands concluded on 10.02.2023 in rejection of the nomination forms of\\n                          contesting candidates and on 13.02.2023 while issuing list of contested\\n                          candidates in Form 16. It is thus seen that the approach of the respondent\\n                          No.3-Returning Officer in en bloc rejection of the nomination forms on\\n                          singular non significant ground has not resulted in ensuring the election but\\n                          the same has resulted in interdiction of the elections. As a matter of fact the\\n                          decision of respondent No.3-Returning Officer cannot be prima facie upheld\\n                          and the same deserves to be adjudicated in exercise of power under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Article\\n                          226</a> of the Constitution. No doubt, the court normally should not interfere\\n                          into the election matters. However, if the court finds that there is no election\\n                          in the eyes of law and the procedure followed results in „selection‟ instead of\\n                          „election‟ the constitutional courts are not powerless to exercise its\\n                          discretionary power under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.

This court is\\n                          prima facie satisfied that a substantial compliance with the requirement of\\n                          the form has been made and all departure from the prescribed format cannot\\n                          therefore, be the ground for rejection of nomination paper. This view is\\n                          supported by the decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of\\n                          <a href=\\\"/doc/27237749/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">Shambhu Prasad Sharma v.
