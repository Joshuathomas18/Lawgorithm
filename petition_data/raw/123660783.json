Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing as\\n\\nAmicus Curiae relying upon the decision of this Court in the case\\n\\nof <a href=\\\"/doc/1868823/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Balchand Jain v. State of M.P.</a> (1976) 4 SCC 572 has submitted\\n\\nthat though the expression “anticipatory bail” has not been\\n\\ndefined in the Code, as observed by this Court in the aforesaid\\n\\ndecision, “anticipatory bail” means “bail in anticipation of arrest”.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">It is submitted that in the aforesaid decision, this Court has\\n\\nfurther observed that the expression “anticipatory bail” is a\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_18\\\">                                                                   2</span>\\n\\fmisnomer inasmuch as it is not as if bail is presently granted by\\n\\nthe Court in anticipation of arrest. It is submitted that when a\\n\\ncompetent court grants “anticipatory bail”, it makes an order that\\n\\nin the event of arrest, a person shall be released on bail. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that there is no question of release on bail unless a\\n\\nperson is arrested and, therefore, it is only on arrest that the\\n\\norder granting “anticipatory bail” becomes operative.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">2.1. Shri Raval, learned Amicus Curiae has taken us to the\\n\\nhistorical perspective on the inclusion of Section 438 of the Cr.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">P.C.   It is submitted that on the recommendation of the Law\\n\\nCommission of India in its 41st Report dated 24.09.1969, the\\n\\nParliament   introduced    a   new   provision   in   the   form   of\\n\\n“anticipatory bail” under <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Section 438</a> of the Cr.P.C.           It is\\n\\nsubmitted that the Law Commission of India in its 41 st Report\\n\\nstated in paragraph 39.9 the justification for power to grant\\n\\n“anticipatory bail”.    It is submitted that as per the Law\\n\\nCommission the necessity for granting “anticipatory bail” arises\\n\\nmainly because sometimes influential persons try to implicate\\n\\ntheir rivals in false cases for the purpose of disgracing them or for\\n\\nother purposes by getting them detained in jail for some days. It\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_19\\\">                                                                   3</span>\\n\\fis submitted that the Law Commission further observed that with\\n\\nthe accentuation of political rivalry, this tendency is showing\\n\\nsigns of steady increase. Apart from false cases, where there are\\n\\nreasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an\\n\\noffence is not likely to abscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty,\\n\\nwhile on bail, there seems to be no justification to require him to\\n\\nfirst submit to custody, remain in prison for some days, and then\\n\\napply for bail.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">2.2   It is further submitted that power to grant “anticipatory bail”\\n\\nvests only in the High Courts or the Courts of Sessions.        It is\\n\\nsubmitted that the “anticipatory bail” can be applied at different\\n\\nstages. It is submitted that even in a case where no FIR is lodged\\n\\nand a person is apprehending his arrest in case the FIR is lodged<a href=\\\"/doc/1868823/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">,\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1868823/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">in that case</a></a>, he can apply for “anticipatory bail” and after notice\\n\\nto the Public Prosecutor the Court can grant “anticipatory bail”.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">It is submitted that even in a case where the FIR is lodged but the\\n\\ninvestigation has not yet begun, i.e., pre investigation stage, the\\n\\n“anticipatory bail” can be applied.         It is submitted that\\n\\n“anticipatory bail” can also be applied at post investigation stage.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">It is submitted that after exercising the discretion judiciously, the\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_20\\\">                                                                   4</span>\\n\\fHigh Court or the Sessions Court grants “anticipatory bail” and\\n\\nthat too after hearing the Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that\\n\\ntherefore once the bail is granted in anticipation of the arrest,\\n\\nthere is no reason to limit the same till the summon is issued by\\n\\nthe Court and/or there is no reason to limit the period of bail in\\n\\nanticipation granted.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">2.3   Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing as\\n\\nAmicus Curiae has further submitted that in the case of\\n\\nGurbaksh Singh Sibbia (supra), a Constitution Bench of this Court\\n\\nhas observed and held that the facility which Section 438, Cr.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">P.C. affords is generally referred to as “anticipatory bail”, an\\n\\nexpression which was used by the Law Commission in its 41 st\\n\\nReport. Neither the section nor its marginal note so describes it\\n\\nbut, the expression “anticipatory bail” is a convenient mode of\\n\\nconveying that it is possible to apply for bail in anticipation of\\n\\narrest. It is submitted that any order of bail can, of course, be\\n\\neffective only from the date of arrest because to grant bail as\\n\\nstated in Wharton’s Law Lexicon, is to “set at liberty a person\\n\\narrested   or   imprisoned,   on   security   being   taken   for   his\\n\\nappearance”. It is submitted that thus, bail is basically release\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_21\\\">                                                                     5</span>\\n\\ffrom restraint, more particularly, release from the custody of the\\n\\npolice.   It is submitted that the act of arrest directly affects\\n\\nfreedom of movement of the person arrested by the police, and\\n\\nspeaking generally, an order of bail gives back to the accused that\\n\\nfreedom on condition that he will appear to take his trial. Taking\\n\\na surety, bonds and such other modalities are the means by\\n\\nwhich an assurance is secured from the accused that though he\\n\\nhas been released on bail, he will present himself at the trial of\\n\\nthe offence or offences of which he is charged and for which he\\n\\nwas arrested.   It is submitted that the distinction between an\\n\\nordinary order of bail and an order of anticipatory bail is that\\n\\nwhereas the former is granted after arrest and therefore means\\n\\nrelease from the custody of the police, the latter is granted in\\n\\nanticipation of arrest and is therefore effective at the very moment\\n\\nof arrest. It is submitted that in other words, unlike a post­arrest\\n\\norder of bail, it is a pre­arrest legal process which directs that if\\n\\nthe person in whose favour it is issued is thereafter arrested on\\n\\nthe accusation in respect of which the direction is issued, he shall\\n\\nbe released on bail.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_22\\\">                                                                   6</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">\\f2.4   Shri Harin P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate appearing as\\n\\nAmicus Curiae has further submitted that however the core\\n\\nquestions before this Court are, (a) what is the life or currency of\\n\\nan anticipatory bail once the same has been granted by the\\n\\ncompetent court?; (b) once an order granting anticipatory bail has\\n\\nbeen passed, whether the said anticipatory bail only survives till\\n\\nthe stage of filing of charge sheet/challan/final report or whether\\n\\nit subsists during the entire duration of trial?.     It is further\\n\\nsubmitted by Shri Raval that one another question may arise,\\n\\nnamely, in a case where if new incriminating materials are found\\n\\nduring the course of investigation, whether they could be relied\\n\\non by the Court to cancel anticipatory bail which has already\\n\\nbeen granted?\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_23\\\">2.5   It is submitted that, as such, the aforesaid questions are not\\n\\nres integra in view of the decision of the Constitution Bench of\\n\\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia</a> (supra).</span>       <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_24\\\">It is\\n\\nsubmitted that in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia</a> (supra), a\\n\\nConstitution Bench of this Court has held that there is no limit to\\n\\nthe currency of an order of anticipatory bail.

This curtailment of power of the\\n\\nmagistrate clearly shows the intent of the legislature that a\\n\\nperson who has been granted bail under Section 438 ought\\n\\nnot to be arrested at the stage of cognizance because of the\\n\\nsaid pre­arrest bail order.   It is submitted that in light of this\\n\\nexpress provision, no other interpretation is possible to be\\n\\ngiven to the said section.

As observed by this Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1868823/\\\" id=\\\"a_75\\\">Balchand Jain</a>\\n\\n(supra), “anticipatory bail” means “bail in anticipation of\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_84\\\">                                                              27</span>\\n\\farrest”. As held by this Court, the expression “anticipatory\\n\\nbail” is a misnomer inasmuch as it is not as if bail is\\n\\npresently granted by the Court in anticipation of arrest. An\\n\\napplication for “anticipatory bail” in anticipation of arrest\\n\\ncould be moved by the accused at a stage before an FIR is\\n\\nfiled or at a stage when FIR is registered but the charge sheet\\n\\nhas not been filed and the investigation is in progress or at a\\n\\nstage after the investigation is concluded.    Power to grant\\n\\n“anticipatory bail” under <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_76\\\">Section 438</a> of the Cr.P.C. vests only\\n\\nwith the Court of Sessions or the High Court.       Therefore,\\n\\nultimately it is for the concerned court to consider the\\n\\napplication for “anticipatory bail” and while granting the\\n\\n“anticipatory bail” it is ultimately for the concerned court to\\n\\nimpose    conditions   including   the    limited   period   of\\n\\n“anticipatory bail”, depends upon the stages at which the\\n\\napplication for anticipatory bail is moved. A person in whose\\n\\nfavour a pre­arrest bail order is made under <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_77\\\">Section 438</a> of\\n\\nthe Cr.P.C. has to be arrested.    However, once there is an\\n\\norder of pre­arrest bail/anticipatory bail, as and when he is\\n\\narrested he has to be released on bail. Otherwise, there is no\\n\\ndistinction or difference between the pre­arrest bail order\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_85\\\">                                                             28</span>\\n\\funder Section 438 and the bail order under <a href=\\\"/doc/848468/\\\" id=\\\"a_78\\\">Section 437</a> &amp;\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1290514/\\\" id=\\\"a_79\\\">439</a> of the Cr.P.C. The only difference between the pre­arrest\\n\\nbail order under Section 438 and the bail order under\\n\\nSections 437 and 439 is the stages at which the bail order is\\n\\npassed.

This is especially true\\n      when the statutory provision which falls for consideration\\n      is designed to secure a valuable right like the right to\\n      personal freedom and involves the application of a\\n      presumption as salutary and deep grained in our criminal\\n      jurisprudence as the presumption of innocence. Though the\\n      right to apply for anticipatory bail was conferred for the\\n      first time by Section 438, while enacting that provision the\\n      legislature was not writing on a clean slate in the sense of\\n      taking an unprecedented step, insofar as the right to apply\\n      for bail is concerned. It had before it two cognate\\n      provisions of the Code: Section 437 which deals with the\\n      power of courts other than the Court of Session and the\\n      High Court to grant bail in non­bailable cases and Section\\n      439 which deals with the “special powers” of the High\\n      Court and the Court of Session regarding bail…..\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_51\\\">            The provisions of Sections 437 and 439 furnished a\\n      convenient model for the legislature to copy while enacting\\n      Section 438.

The\\ndeparture, in our opinion, was made advisedly and\\npurposefully: Advisedly, at least in part, because of the\\n41st Report of the Law Commission which, while pointing\\nout the necessity of introducing a provision in the Code\\nenabling the High Court and the Court of Session to grant\\nanticipatory bail, said in para 39.9 that it had “considered\\ncarefully the question of laying down in the statute certain\\nconditions under which alone anticipatory bail could be\\ngranted” but had come to the conclusion that the question\\nof granting such bail should be left “to the discretion of the\\ncourt” and ought not to be fettered by the statutory\\nprovision itself, since the discretion was being conferred\\nupon superior courts which were expected to exercise it\\njudicially. The legislature conferred a wide discretion on\\nthe High Court and the Court of Session to grant\\nanticipatory bail because it evidently felt, firstly, that it\\nwould be difficult to enumerate the conditions under which\\nanticipatory bail should or should not be granted and\\nsecondly, because the intention was to allow the higher\\ncourts in the echelon a somewhat free hand in the grant of\\nrelief in the nature of anticipatory bail. That is why,\\ndeparting from the terms of Sections 437 and 439, Section\\n438(1) uses the language that the High Court or the Court\\nof Session “may, if it thinks fit” direct that the applicant be\\nreleased on bail. Sub­section (2) of Section 438 is a further\\nand clearer manifestation of the same legislative intent to\\nconfer a wide discretionary power to grant anticipatory\\nbail. It provides that the High Court or the Court of Session,\\nwhile issuing a direction for the grant of anticipatory bail,\\n“may include such conditions in such directions in the light\\nof the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit”,\\nincluding the conditions which are set out in clauses (i) to\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_52\\\">(iv) of sub­section (2).

It has to be borne in mind that\\nanticipatory bail is sought when there is a mere\\napprehension of arrest on the accusation that the applicant\\nhas committed a non­ bailable offence. A person who has\\nyet to lose his freedom by being arrested asks for freedom\\nin the event of arrest. That is the stage at which it is\\nimperative to protect his freedom, insofar as one may, and\\nto give full play to the presumption that he is innocent. In\\nfact, the stage at which anticipatory bail if generally sought\\nbrings about its striking dissimilarity with the situation in\\nwhich a person who is arrested for the commission of a\\nnon­bailable offence asks for bail. In the latter situation,\\nadequate data is available to the court, or can be called for\\nby it, in the light of which it can grant or refuse relief and\\nwhile granting it, modify it by the imposition of all or any of\\nthe conditions mentioned in Section 437.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_54\\\">      13. This is not to say that anticipatory bail, if\\ngranted, must be granted without the imposition of any\\nconditions. That will be plainly contrary to the very terms of\\nSection 438. Though sub­section (1) of that section says\\nthat the court “may, if it thinks fit” issue the necessary\\ndirection for bail, sub­section (2) confers on the court the\\npower to include such conditions in the direction as it may\\nthink fit in the light of the facts of the particular case,\\nincluding the conditions mentioned in clauses (i) to (iv) of\\nthat sub­section. The controversy therefore is not whether\\nthe court has the power to impose conditions while granting\\nanticipatory bail. It clearly and expressly has that power.\\nThe true question is whether by a process of construction,\\nthe amplitude of judicial discretion which is given to the\\nHigh Court and the Court of Session, to impose such\\nconditions as they may think fit while granting anticipatory\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_92\\\">                                                                  33</span>\\n\\fbail, should be cut down by reading into the statute\\nconditions which are not to be found therein, like those\\nevolved by the High Court or canvassed by the learned\\nAdditional Solicitor General. Our answer, clearly and\\nemphatically, is in the negative. The High Court and the\\nCourt of Session to whom the application for anticipatory\\nbail is made ought to be left free in the exercise of their\\njudicial discretion to grant bail if they consider it fit so to do\\non the particular facts and circumstances of the case and\\non such conditions as the case may warrant. Similarly,\\nthey must be left free to refuse bail if the circumstances of\\nthe case so warrant, on considerations similar to those\\nmentioned in Section 437 or which are generally\\nconsidered to be relevant under Section 439 of the Code.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_55\\\">      xxx     xxx    xxx   xxx    xxx    xxx    xxx    xxx\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_56\\\">      18. According to the sixth proposition framed by the\\nHigh Court, the discretion under Section 438 cannot be\\nexercised in regard to offences punishable with death or\\nimprisonment for life unless, the court at the stage of\\ngranting anticipatory bail, is satisfied that such a charge\\nappears to be false or groundless. Now, Section 438\\nconfers on the High Court and the Court of Session the\\npower to grant anticipatory bail if the applicant has reason\\nto believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of\\nhaving committed “a non­bailable offence”. We see no\\nwarrant for reading into this provision the conditions\\nsubject to which bail can be granted under Section 437(1)\\nof the Code. That section, while conferring the power to\\ngrant bail in cases of non­bailable offences, provides by\\nway of an exception that a person accused or suspected of\\nthe commission of a non­bailable offence “shall not be so\\nreleased” if there appear to be reasonable grounds for\\nbelieving that he has been guilty of an offence punishable\\nwith death or imprisonment for life. If it was intended that\\nthe exception contained in Section 437(1) should govern the\\ngrant of relief under Section 438(1), nothing would have\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_93\\\">                                                                     34</span>\\n\\fbeen easier for the legislature than to introduce into the\\nlatter section a similar provision. We have already pointed\\nout the basic distinction between these two sections.\\nSection 437 applies only after a person, who is alleged to\\nhave committed a non­bailable offence, is arrested or\\ndetained without warrant or appears or is brought before a\\ncourt. Section 438 applies before the arrest is made and, in\\nfact, one of the pre­conditions of its application is that the\\nperson, who applies for relief under it, must be able to\\nshow that he has reason to believe that “he may be\\narrested”, which plainly means that he is not yet arrested.\\nThe nexus which this distinction bears with the grant or\\nrefusal of bail is that in cases falling under Section 437,\\nthere is some concrete data on the basis of which it is\\npossible to show that there appear to be reasonable\\ngrounds for believing that the applicant has been guilty of\\nan offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.\\nIn cases falling under Section 438 that stage is still to\\narrive and, in the generality of cases thereunder, it would\\nbe premature and indeed difficult to predicate that there\\nare or are not reasonable grounds for so believing. The\\nfoundation of the belief spoken of in Section 437(1), by\\nreason of which the court cannot release the applicant on\\nbail is, normally, the credibility of the allegations contained\\nin the first information report. In the majority of cases\\nfalling under Section 438, that data will be lacking for\\nforming the requisite belief. If at all the conditions\\nmentioned in Section 437 are to be read into the provisions\\nof Section 438, the transplantation shall have to be done\\nwithout amputation. That is to say, on the reasoning of the\\nHigh Court, Section 438(1) shall have to be read as\\ncontaining the clause that the applicant “shall not” be\\nreleased on bail “if there appear reasonable grounds for\\nbelieving that he has been guilty of an offence punishable\\nwith death or imprisonment for life”. In this process one\\nshall have overlooked that whereas, the power under\\nSection 438(1) can be exercised if the High Court or the\\nCourt of Session “thinks fit” to do so, Section 437(1) does\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_94\\\">                                                                  35</span>\\n\\fnot confer the power to grant bail in the same wide terms\\nThe expression “if it thinks fit”, which occurs in Section\\n438(1) in relation to the power of the High Court or the\\nCourt of Session, is conspicuously absent in Section 437(1).\\nWe see no valid reason for rewriting Section 438 with a\\nview, not to expanding the scope and ambit of the\\ndiscretion conferred on the High Court and the Court of\\nSession but, for the purpose of limiting it. Accordingly, we\\nare unable to endorse the view of the High Court that\\nanticipatory bail cannot be granted in respect of offences\\nlike criminal breach of trust for the mere reason that the\\npunishment provided therefor is imprisonment for life.\\nCircumstances may broadly justify the grant of bail in such\\ncases too, though of course, the court is free to refuse\\nanticipatory bail in any case if there is material before it\\njustifying such refusal.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_57\\\">      <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"481284\\\" id=\\\"span_95\\\">19. A great deal has been said by the High Court on\\nthe fifth proposition framed by it, according to which, inter\\nalia, the power under Section 438 should not be exercised\\nif the investigating agency can make a reasonable claim\\nthat it can secure incriminating material from information\\nlikely to be received from the offender under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_88\\\">Section 27</a> of\\nthe Evidence Act. According to the High Court, it is the right\\nand the duty of the police to investigate into offences\\nbrought to their notice and therefore, courts should be\\ncareful not to exercise their powers in a manner which is\\ncalculated to cause interference therewith. ….. An order of\\nanticipatory bail does not in any way, directly or indirectly,\\ntake away from the police their right to investigate into\\ncharges made or to be made against the person released\\non bail. In fact, two of the usual conditions incorporated in\\na direction issued under Section 438(1) are those\\nrecommended in sub­section (2)(i) and (ii) which require the\\napplicant to cooperate with the police and to assure that he\\nshall not tamper with the witnesses during and after the\\ninvestigation. While granting relief under Section 438(1),\\nappropriate conditions can be imposed under <a href=\\\"/doc/1730374/\\\" id=\\\"a_89\\\">Section\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_96\\\">                                                                 36</span></a>\\n\\f438(2) so as to ensure an uninterrupted investigation. One\\nof such conditions can even be that in the event of the\\npolice making out a case of a likely discovery under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_90\\\">Section\\n27</a> of the Evidence Act, the person released on bail shall be\\nliable to be taken in police custody for facilitating the\\ndiscovery. Besides, if and when the occasion arises, it may\\nbe possible for the prosecution to claim the benefit of\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_91\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act in regard to a discovery of\\nfacts made in pursuance of information supplied by a\\nperson released on bail by invoking the principle stated by\\nthis Court in <a href=\\\"/doc/481284/\\\" id=\\\"a_92\\\">State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya</a> [AIR 1960\\nSC 1125 : (1961) 1 SCR 14, 26 : 1960 Cri LJ 1504] to the\\neffect that when a person not in custody approaches a\\npolice officer investigating an offence and offers to give\\ninformation leading to the discovery of a fact, having a\\nbearing on the charge which may be made against him, he\\nmay appropriately be deemed so have surrendered himself\\nto the police. The broad foundation of this rule is stated to\\nbe that <a href=\\\"/doc/706971/\\\" id=\\\"a_93\\\">Section 46</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure does\\nnot contemplate any formality before a person can be said\\nto be taken in custody: submission to the custody by word\\nor action by a person is sufficient. For similar reasons, we\\nare unable to agree that anticipatory bail should be refused\\nif a legitimate case for the remand of the offender to the\\npolice custody under <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_94\\\">Section 167(2)</a> of the Code is made\\nout by the investigating agency.</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_58\\\">      20. It   is   unnecessary   to   consider   the   third\\nproposition of the High Court in any great details because\\nwe have already indicated that there is no justification for\\nreading into Section 438 the limitations mentioned in\\nSection 437. The High Court says that such limitations are\\nimplicit in Section 438 but, with respect, no such\\nimplications arise or can be read into that section. The\\nplenitude of the section must be given its full play.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_59\\\">      21. The High Court says in its fourth proposition that\\nin addition to the limitations mentioned in Section 437, the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_97\\\">                                                                37</span>\\n\\fpetitioner must make out a “special case” for the exercise of\\nthe power to grant anticipatory bail. This, virtually, reduces\\nthe salutary power conferred by Section 438 to a dead\\nletter. In its anxiety, otherwise just, to show that the power\\nconferred by Section 438 is not “unguided or uncanalised”,\\nthe High Court has subjected that power to a restraint\\nwhich will have the effect of making the power utterly\\nunguided. To say that the applicant must make out a\\n“special case” for the exercise of the power to grant\\nanticipatory bail is really to say nothing. The applicant has\\nundoubtedly to make out a case for the grant of\\nanticipatory bail. But one cannot go further and say that he\\nmust make out a “special case”. We do not see why the\\nprovisions of Section 438 should be suspected as\\ncontaining something volatile or incendiary, which needs to\\nbe handled with the greatest care and caution imaginable.\\nA wise exercise of judicial power inevitably takes care of\\nthe evil consequences which are likely to flow out of its\\nintemperate use. Every kind of judicial discretion, whatever\\nmay be the nature of the matter in regard to which it is\\nrequired to be exercised, has to be used with due care and\\ncaution. In fact, an awareness of the context in which the\\ndiscretion is required to be exercised and of the reasonably\\nforeseeable consequences of its use, is the hallmark of a\\nprudent exercise of judicial discretion. One ought not to\\nmake a bugbear of the power to grant anticipatory bail.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_60\\\">      22. By proposition No. 1 the High Court says that the\\npower conferred by Section 438 is “of an extraordinary\\ncharacter and must be exercised sparingly in exceptional\\ncases only”. It may perhaps be right to describe the power\\nas of an extraordinary character because ordinarily the\\nbail is applied for under Section 437 or Section 439. These\\nsections deal with the power to grant or refuse bail to a\\nperson who is in the custody of the police and that is the\\nordinary situation in which bail is generally applied for.\\nBut this does not justify the conclusion that the power must\\nbe exercised in exceptional cases only, because it is of an\\nextraordinary character. We will really be saying once too\\noften that all discretion has to be exercised with care and\\ncircumspection, depending on circumstances justifying its\\nexercise.

We would, therefore, prefer to leave the High\\nCourt and the Court of Session to exercise their jurisdiction\\nunder Section 438 by a wise and careful use of their\\ndiscretion which, by their long training and experience,\\nthey are ideally suited to do. The ends of justice will be\\nbetter served by trusting these courts to act objectively and\\nin consonance with principles governing the grant of bail\\nwhich are recognised over the years, than by divesting\\nthem of their discretion which the legislature has conferred\\nupon them, by laying down inflexible rules of general\\napplication. It is customary, almost chronic, to take a\\nstatute as one finds it on the ground that, after all, “the\\nlegislature in its wisdom” has thought it fit to use a\\nparticular expression. A convention may usefully grow\\nwhereby the High Court and the Court of Session may be\\ntrusted to exercise their discretionary powers in their\\nwisdom, especially when the discretion is entrusted to their\\ncare by the legislature in its wisdom. If they err, they are\\nliable to be corrected.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_99\\\">                                                                39</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_11\\\">\\f      xxx    xxx    xxx   xxx    xxx\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_12\\\">      35. Section 438(1) of the Code lays down a condition\\nwhich has to be satisfied before anticipatory bail can be\\ngranted. The applicant must show that he has “reason to\\nbelieve” that he may be arrested for a non­bailable offence.\\nThe use of the expression “reason to believe” shows that\\nthe belief that the applicant may be so arrested must be\\nfounded on reasonable grounds. Mere ‘fear’ is not ‘belief”,\\nfor which reason it is not enough for the applicant to show\\nthat he has some sort of a vague apprehension that some\\none is going to make an accusation against him, in\\npursuance of which he may be arrested. The grounds on\\nwhich the belief of the applicant is based that he may be\\narrested for a non­bailable offence, must be capable of\\nbeing examined by the court objectively, because it is then\\nalone that the court can determine whether the applicant\\nhas reason to believe that he may be so arrested. Section\\n438(1), therefore, cannot be invoked on the basis of vague\\nand general allegations, as if to arm oneself in perpetuity\\nagainst a possible arrest. Otherwise, the number of\\napplications for anticipatory bail will be as large as, at any\\nrate, the adult populace. Anticipatory bail is a device to\\nsecure the individuals liberty; it is neither a passport to the\\ncommission of crimes nor a shield against any and all\\nkinds of accusations, likely or unlikely\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_13\\\">      36. Secondly, if an application for anticipatory bail is\\nmade to the High Court or the Court of Session it must\\napply its own mind to the question and decide whether a\\ncase has been made out for granting such relief. It cannot\\nleave the question for the decision of the Magistrate\\nconcerned under Section 437 of the Code, as and when an\\noccasion arises. Such a course will defeat the very object of\\nSection 438.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_100\\\">                                                                  40</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_14\\\">\\f      37. Thirdly, the filing of a first information report is\\nnot a condition precedent to the exercise of the power under\\nSection 438. The imminence of a likely arrest founded on a\\nreasonable belief can be shown to exist even if an FIR is\\nnot yet filed.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_15\\\">      38. Fourthly, anticipatory bail can be granted even\\nafter an FIR is filed, so long as the applicant has not been\\narrested.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_16\\\">      39. Fifthly, the provisions of Section 438 cannot be\\ninvoked after the arrest of the accused. The grant of\\n“anticipatory bail” to an accused who is under arrest\\ninvolves a contradiction in terms, insofar as the offence or\\noffences for which he is arrested, are concerned. After\\narrest, the accused must seek his remedy under Section\\n437 or Section 439 of the Code, if he wants to be released\\non bail in respect of the offence or offences for which he is\\narrested.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_17\\\">      40. We have said that there is one proposition\\nformulated by the High Court with which we are inclined to\\nagree. That is proposition (2). We agree that a ‘blanket\\norder’ of anticipatory bail should not generally be passed.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_64\\\">This flows from the very language of the section which, as\\ndiscussed above, requires the applicant to show that he\\nhas “reason to believe” that he may be arrested. A belief\\ncan be said to be founded on reasonable grounds only if\\nthere is something tangible to go by on the basis of which it\\ncan be said that the applicant&#x27;s apprehension that he may\\nbe arrested is genuine. That is why, normally, a direction\\nshould not issue under Section 438(1) to the effect that the\\napplicant shall be released on bail “whenever arrested for\\nwhichever offence whatsoever”. That is what is meant by a\\n‘blanket order’ of anticipatory bail, an order which serves\\nas a blanket to cover or protect any and every kind of\\nallegedly unlawful activity, in fact any eventuality, likely or\\nunlikely regarding which, no concrete information can\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_101\\\">                                                                  41</span>\\n\\fpossibly be had. The rationale of a direction under Section\\n438(1) is the belief of the applicant founded on reasonable\\ngrounds that he may be arrested for a non­bailable offence.\\nIt is unrealistic to expect the applicant to draw up his\\napplication with the meticulousness of a pleading in a civil\\ncase and such is not requirement of the section. But\\nspecific events and facts must be disclosed by the\\napplicant in order to enable the court to judge of the\\nreasonableness of his belief, the existence of which is the\\nsine qua non of the exercise of power conferred by the\\nsection.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_65\\\">      41. Apart from the fact that the very language of the\\nstatute compels this construction, there is an important\\nprinciple involved in the insistence that facts, on the basis\\nof which a direction under Section 438(1) is sought, must\\nbe clear and specific, not vague and general. It is only by\\nthe observance of that principle that a possible conflict\\nbetween the right of an individual to his liberty and the\\nright of the police to investigate into crimes reported to them\\ncan be avoided. A blanket order of anticipatory bail is\\nbound to cause serious interference with both the right and\\nthe duty of the police in the matter of investigation because,\\nregardless of what kind of offence is alleged to have been\\ncommitted by the applicant and when, an order of bail\\nwhich comprehends allegedly unlawful activity of any\\ndescription whatsoever, will prevent the police from\\narresting the applicant even if he commits, say, a murder in\\nthe presence of the public. Such an order can then become\\na charter of lawlessness and a weapon to stifle prompt\\ninvestigation into offences which could not possibly be\\npredicated when the order was passed. Therefore, the\\ncourt which grants anticipatory bail must take care to\\nspecify the offence or offences in respect of which alone the\\norder will be effective. The power should not be exercised\\nin a vacuum.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_102\\\">                                                                  42</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_66\\\">\\f      42. There was some discussion before us on certain\\nminor modalities regarding the passing of bail orders under\\nSection 438(1). Can an order of bail be passed under the\\nsection without notice to the Public Prosecutor? It can be.\\nBut notice should issue to the Public Prosecutor or the\\nGovernment Advocate forthwith and the question of bail\\nshould be re­examined in the light of the respective\\ncontentions of the parties. The ad interim order too must\\nconform to the requirements of the section and suitable\\nconditions should be imposed on the applicant even at that\\nstage. Should the operation of an order passed under\\nSection 438(1) be limited in point of time? Not necessarily.\\nThe court may, if there are reasons for doing so, limit the\\noperation of the order to a short period until after the filing\\nof an FIR in respect of the matter covered by the order. The\\napplicant may in such cases be directed to obtain an order\\nof bail under Section 437 or 439 of the Code within a\\nreasonably short period after the filing of the FIR as\\naforesaid. But this need not be followed as an invariable\\nrule. The normal rule should be not to limit the\\noperation of the order in relation to a period of time.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_67\\\">      43. During the last couple of years this Court, while\\ndealing with appeals against orders passed by various\\nHigh Courts, has granted anticipatory bail to many a\\nperson by imposing conditions set out in Section 438(2) (i),\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_68\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_103\\\">(ii) and (iii). The court has, in addition, directed in most of\\nthose cases that (a) the applicant should surrender himself\\nto the police for a brief period if a discovery is to be made\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_95\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act or that he should be\\ndeemed to have surrendered himself if such a discovery is\\nto be made. In certain exceptional cases, the court has, in\\nview of the material placed before it, directed that the order\\nof anticipatory bail will remain in operation only for a week\\nor so until after the filing of the FIR in respect of matters\\ncovered by the order. These orders, on the whole, have\\nworked satisfactorily, causing the least inconvenience to\\nthe individuals concerned and least interference with the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_104\\\">                                                                  43</span>\\n\\f      investigational rights of the police. The court has attempted\\n      through those orders to strike a balance between the\\n      individual&#x27;s right to personal freedom and the\\n      investigational rights of the police.

First, a background. The judgment of a five-judge bench of this court in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_116\\\">Shri\\nGurbaksh Singh Sibbia and others v.

PC” or “the Code”). Section 438\\nenables two classes of courts- a Court of Sessions and High Court, to issue directions\\nnot to arrest a person, who apprehends arrest. Sibbia comprehensively dealt with the\\nhistory of the provision, the felt need which resulted in its enactment, the observations\\nand comments of the 41st Report of the Law Commission, which had suggested\\nintroduction of such a provision, and the efficacy of prevailing practices. In brief,\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_131\\\">1</span>\\n    1980 (2) SCC 565\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_132\\\">                                                                                      51</span>\\n\\fSibbia (which this court would analyze in greater detail later) held that the power (to\\ngrant anticipatory bail) is cast in wide terms and should not be hedged in through\\nnarrow judicial interpretation.

The court, in Sibbia, elaborately dealt with the background which led to the\\nintroduction of the provision for anticipatory bail. It took note of the forty first report\\nof the Law Commission, on whose recommendations the provision was introduced.\\nSibbia traced the history of the provision, from the stage of the recommendation, to\\nthe draft bill and later its enactment, observing as follows:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_31\\\">       “4. The <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_128\\\">CrPC</a>, 1898 did not contain any specific provision corresponding\\n       to the present Section 438. Under the old Code, there was a sharp\\n       difference of opinion amongst the various High Courts on the question as to\\n       whether courts had the inherent power to pass an order of bail, in\\n       anticipation of arrest, the preponderance of view being that it did not have\\n       such power. The need for extensive amendments to the <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_129\\\">CrPC</a> was felt for a\\n       long time and various suggestions were made in different quarters in order\\n       to make the Code more effective and comprehensive. The Law Commission\\n       of India, in its 41st Report dated September 24, 1969 pointed put the\\n       necessity of introducing a provision in the Code enabling the High Court\\n       and the Court of Session to grant &quot;anticipate; bail&quot;. It observed in\\n       paragraph 39.9 of its report (Volume I) :\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_32\\\">       39.9. The suggestion for directing the release of a person on bail prior to\\n       his arrest (commonly known as &quot;anticipatory bail&quot;) was carefully\\n       considered by us. Though there is a conflict of judicial opinion about the\\n       power of a Court to- grant anticipatory bail, the majority view is that there\\n       is no such power under the existing provisions of the Code. The necessity\\n       for granting anticipatory bail arises mainly because sometimes influential\\n       persons try to&#x27; implicate their rivals in false cases for the purpose of\\n       disgracing them or for other purposes by getting them detained in jail for\\n       some days. In recent times, with the accentuation of political rivalry, this\\n       tendency is showing signs of steady increase. Apart from false cases, where\\n       there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an\\n       offence is not likely to abscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty while on\\n       bail, there seems no justification to require him first to submit to custody,\\n       remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail.\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_80\\\">       We recommend the acceptance of this suggestion. We are further of the view\\n       that this special power should be conferred only on the High Court and the\\n       Court of Session, and that the order should take effect at the time of arrest\\n       or thereafter.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_81\\\">       In order to settle the details of this suggestion, the following draft of a, new\\n       section is placed for consideration :\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_154\\\">                                                                                          53</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_33\\\">\\f       ‘497A.

Sibbia discussed this issue and held that the narrow, restricted interpretation of\\nSection 438 was not warranted. The court disapproved the Punjab High Court Full\\nBench decision; the five judge Bench ruled as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_38\\\">       “…The provisions of Sections 437 and 439 furnished a convenient model\\n       for the legislature to copy while enacting Section 438. If it has not done so\\n       and has departed from a pattern which could easily be adopted with the\\n       necessary modifications, it would be wrong to refuse to give to the\\n       departure its full effect by assuming that it was not intended to serve any\\n       particular or specific purpose. The departure, in our opinion, was made\\n       advisedly and purposefully: Advisedly, at least in part, because of the 41st\\n       Report of the Law Commission which, while pointing out the necessity of\\n       introducing a provision in the Code enabling the High Court and the Court\\n       of Session to grant anticipatory bail, said in para 39.9 that it had\\n       “considered carefully the question of laying down in the statute certain\\n       conditions under which alone anticipatory bail could be granted” but had\\n       come to the conclusion that the question of granting such bail should be left\\n       “to the discretion of the court” and ought not to be fettered by the statutory\\n       provision itself, since the discretion was being conferred upon superior\\n       courts which were expected to exercise it judicially. The legislature\\n       conferred a wide discretion on the High Court and the Court of Session to\\n       grant anticipatory bail because it evidently felt, firstly, that it would be\\n       difficult to enumerate the conditions under which anticipatory bail should\\n       or should not be granted and secondly, because the intention was to allow\\n       the higher courts in the echelon a somewhat free hand in the grant of relief\\n       in the nature of anticipatory bail. That is why, departing from the terms of\\n       Sections 437 and 439, Section 438(1) uses the language that the High Court\\n       or the Court of Session “may, if it thinks fit” direct that the applicant be\\n       released on bail. Sub-section (2) of Section 438 is a further and clearer\\n       manifestation of the same legislative intent to confer a wide discretionary\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_157\\\">                                                                                        56</span>\\n\\fpower to grant anticipatory bail. It provides that the High Court or the\\nCourt of Session, while issuing a direction for the grant of anticipatory bail,\\n“may include such conditions in such directions in the light of the facts of\\nthe particular case, as it may think fit”, including the conditions which are\\nset out in clauses (i) to (iv) of sub-section (2). The proof of legislative intent\\ncan best be found in the language which the legislature uses. Ambiguities\\ncan undoubtedly be resolved by resort to extraneous aids but words, as\\nwide and explicit as have been used in Section 438, must be given their full\\neffect, especially when to refuse to do so will result in undue impairment of\\nthe freedom of the individual and the presumption of innocence. It has to be\\nborne in mind that anticipatory bail is sought when there is a mere\\napprehension of arrest on the accusation that the applicant has committed a\\nnon- bailable offence. A person who has yet to lose his freedom by being\\narrested asks for freedom in the event of arrest. That is the stage at which it\\nis imperative to protect his freedom, insofar as one may, and to give full\\nplay to the presumption that he is innocent. In fact, the stage at which\\nanticipatory bail if generally sought brings about its striking dissimilarity\\nwith the situation in which a person who is arrested for the commission of a\\nnon-bailable offence asks for bail. In the latter situation, adequate data is\\navailable to the court, or can be called for by it, in the light of which it can\\ngrant or refuse relief and while granting it, modify it by the imposition of all\\nor any of the conditions mentioned in Section 437.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_39\\\">13. This is not to say that anticipatory bail, if granted, must be granted\\nwithout the imposition of any conditions. That will be plainly contrary to\\nthe very terms of Section 438.

The controversy therefore is not whether the court has the power to\\nimpose conditions while granting anticipatory bail. It clearly and expressly\\nhas that power. The true question is whether by a process of construction,\\nthe amplitude of judicial discretion which is given to the High Court and\\nthe Court of Session, to impose such conditions as they may think fit while\\ngranting anticipatory bail, should be cut down by reading into the statute\\nconditions which are not to be found therein, like those evolved by the High\\nCourt or canvassed by the learned Additional Solicitor General. Our\\nanswer, clearly and emphatically, is in the negative. The High Court and\\nthe Court of Session to whom the application for anticipatory bail is made\\nought to be left free in the exercise of their judicial discretion to grant bail\\nif they consider it fit so to do on the particular facts and circumstances of\\nthe case and on such conditions as the case may warrant. Similarly, they\\nmust be left free to refuse bail if the circumstances of the case so warrant,\\non considerations similar to those mentioned in Section 437 or which are\\ngenerally considered to be relevant under Section 439 of the Code.\\n</p>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_158\\\">                                                                                     57</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_92\\\">\\f14. Generalizations on matters which rest on discretion and the attempt to\\ndiscover formulae of universal application when facts are bound to differ\\nfrom case to case frustrate the very purpose of conferring discretion. No\\ntwo cases are alike on facts and therefore, courts have to be allowed a little\\nfree play in the joints if the conferment of discretionary power is to be\\nmeaningful. There is no risk involved in entrusting a wide discretion to the\\nCourt of Session and the High Court in granting anticipatory bail because,\\nfirstly, these are higher courts manned by experienced persons, secondly,\\ntheir orders are not final but are open to appellate or revisional scrutiny\\nand above all because, discretion has always to be exercised by courts\\njudicially and not according to whim, caprice or fancy. On the other hand,\\nthere is a risk in foreclosing categories of cases in which anticipatory bail\\nmay be allowed because life throws up unforeseen possibilities and offers\\nnew challenges. Judicial discretion has to be free enough to be able to take\\nthese possibilities in its stride and to meet these challenges.

A great deal has been said by the High Court on the fifth proposition\\nframed by it, according to which, inter alia, the power under Section 438\\nshould not be exercised if the investigating agency can make a reasonable\\nclaim that it can secure incriminating material from information likely to be\\nreceived from the offender under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_133\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act. According\\nto the High Court, it is the right and the duty of the police to investigate\\ninto offences brought to their notice and therefore, courts should be careful\\nnot to exercise their powers in a manner which is calculated to cause\\ninterference therewith. It is true that the functions of the judiciary and the\\npolice are in a sense complementary and not overlapping. And, as observed\\nby the Privy Council in <a href=\\\"/doc/1708066/\\\" id=\\\"a_134\\\">King-Emperor v.

An order quashing such proceedings\\nputs an end to the proceedings with the inevitable result that all\\ninvestigation into the accusation comes to a halt. Therefore, it was held that\\nthe court cannot, in the exercise of its inherent powers, virtually direct that\\nthe police shall not investigate into the charges contained in the FIR. We\\nare concerned here with a situation of an altogether different kind. An order\\nof anticipatory bail does not in any way, directly or indirectly, take away\\nfrom the police their right to investigate into charges made or to be made\\nagainst the person released on bail. In fact, two of the usual conditions\\nincorporated in a direction issued under Section 438(1) are those\\nrecommended in sub-section (2)(i) and (ii) which require the applicant to\\ncooperate with the police and to assure that he shall not tamper with the\\nwitnesses during and after the investigation. While granting relief under\\nSection 438(1), appropriate conditions can be imposed under Section\\n438(2) so as to ensure an uninterrupted investigation. One of such\\nconditions can even be that in the event of the police making out a case of a\\nlikely discovery under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_136\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, the person released\\non bail shall be liable to be taken in police custody for facilitating the\\ndiscovery. Besides, if and when the occasion arises, it may be possible for\\nthe prosecution to claim the benefit of <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_137\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act in\\nregard to a discovery of facts made in pursuance of information supplied by\\na person released on bail by invoking the principle stated by this Court in\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/481284/\\\" id=\\\"a_138\\\">State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya</a> [AIR 1960 SC 1125 : (1961) 1 SCR 14,\\n26 : 1960 Cri LJ 1504] to the effect that when a person not in custody\\napproaches a police officer investigating an offence and offers to give\\ninformation leading to the discovery of a fact, having a bearing on the\\ncharge which may be made against him, he may appropriately be deemed\\nso have surrendered himself to the police. The broad foundation of this rule\\nis stated to be that <a href=\\\"/doc/706971/\\\" id=\\\"a_139\\\">Section 46</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not\\ncontemplate any formality before a person can be said to be taken in\\ncustody: submission to the custody by word or action by a person is\\nsufficient. For similar reasons, we are unable to agree that anticipatory bail\\nshould be refused if a legitimate case for the remand of the offender to the\\npolice custody under <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_140\\\">Section 167(2)</a> of the Code is made out by the\\ninvestigating agency.</span>\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_41\\\">------------                       ---------                           -------\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_42\\\">21. The High Court says in its fourth proposition that in addition to the\\nlimitations mentioned in Section 437, the petitioner must make out a\\n“special case” for the exercise of the power to grant anticipatory bail. This,\\nvirtually, reduces the salutary power conferred by Section 438 to a dead\\nletter. In its anxiety, otherwise just, to show that the power conferred by\\nSection 438 is not “unguided or uncanalised”, the High Court has\\nsubjected that power to a restraint which will have the effect of making the\\npower utterly unguided. To say that the applicant must make out a “special\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_162\\\">                                                                                  59</span>\\n\\fcase” for the exercise of the power to grant anticipatory bail is really to say\\nnothing. The applicant has undoubtedly to make out a case for the grant of\\nanticipatory bail. But one cannot go further and say that he must make out\\na “special case”. We do not see why the provisions of Section 438 should\\nbe suspected as containing something volatile or incendiary, which needs to\\nbe handled with the greatest care and caution imaginable. A wise exercise\\nof judicial power inevitably takes care of the evil consequences which are\\nlikely to flow out of its intemperate use. Every kind of judicial discretion,\\nwhatever may be the nature of the matter in regard to which it is required to\\nbe exercised, has to be used with due care and caution. In fact, an\\nawareness of the context in which the discretion is required to be exercised\\nand of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its use, is the hallmark\\nof a prudent exercise of judicial discretion. One ought not to make a\\nbugbear of the power to grant anticipatory bail.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_43\\\">---------                          ----------                   ---------\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_44\\\">22. By proposition No. 1 the High Court says that the power conferred by\\nSection 438 is “of an extraordinary character and must be exercised\\nsparingly in exceptional cases only”. It may perhaps be right to describe\\nthe power as of an extraordinary character because ordinarily the bail is\\napplied for under Section 437 or Section 439. These sections deal with the\\npower to grant or refuse bail to a person who is in the custody of the police\\nand that is the ordinary situation in which bail is generally applied for. But\\nthis does not justify the conclusion that the power must be exercised in\\nexceptional cases only, because it is of an extraordinary character. We will\\nreally be saying once too often that all discretion has to be exercised with\\ncare and circumspection, depending on circumstances justifying its\\nexercise. It is unnecessary to travel beyond it and subject the wide power\\nconferred by the legislature to a rigorous code of self-imposed limitations.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_45\\\">---------                          ----------                   ---------\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_46\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"43475503\\\" id=\\\"span_163\\\">26. We find a great deal of substance in Mr Tarkunde&#x27;s submission that\\nsince denial of bail amounts to deprivation of personal liberty, the court\\nshould lean against the imposition of unnecessary restrictions on the scope\\nof Section 438, especially when no such restrictions have been imposed by\\nthe legislature in the terms of that section. Section 438 is a procedural\\nprovision which is concerned with the personal liberty of the individual,\\nwho is entitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence since he is\\nnot, on the date of his application for anticipatory bail, convicted of the\\noffence in respect of which he seeks bail. An over-generous infusion of\\nconstraints and conditions which are not to be found in Section 438 can\\nmake its provisions constitutionally vulnerable since the right to personal\\nfreedom cannot be made to depend on compliance with unreasonable\\nrestrictions. The beneficent provision contained in Section 438 must be\\nsaved, not jettisoned. No doubt can linger after the decision in <a href=\\\"/doc/43475503/\\\" id=\\\"a_141\\\">Maneka\\nGandhi [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India</a>, (1978) 1 SCC 248] , that in\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_164\\\">                                                                                  60</span>\\n\\forder to meet the challenge of <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_142\\\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the procedure\\nestablished by law for depriving a person of his liberty must be fair, just\\nand reasonable. Section 438, in the form in which it is conceived by the\\nlegislature, is open to no exception on the ground that it prescribes a\\nprocedure which is unjust or unfair.

We would, therefore, prefer to leave the High Court and the Court of\\nSession to exercise their jurisdiction under Section 438 by a wise and\\ncareful use of their discretion which, by their long training and experience,\\nthey are ideally suited to do. The ends of justice will be better served by\\ntrusting these courts to act objectively and in consonance with principles\\ngoverning the grant of bail which are recognised over the years, than by\\ndivesting them of their discretion which the legislature has conferred upon\\nthem, by laying down inflexible rules of general application. It is\\ncustomary, almost chronic, to take a statute as one finds it on the ground\\nthat, after all, “the legislature in its wisdom” has thought it fit to use a\\nparticular expression. A convention may usefully grow whereby the High\\nCourt and the Court of Session may be trusted to exercise their\\ndiscretionary powers in their wisdom, especially when the discretion is\\nentrusted to their care by the legislature in its wisdom. If they err, they are\\nliable to be corrected.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_49\\\">34. This should be the end of the matter, but it is necessary to clarify a few\\npoints which have given rise to certain misgivings.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_50\\\">35. Section 438(1) of the Code lays down a condition which has to be\\nsatisfied before anticipatory bail can be granted. The applicant must show\\nthat he has “reason to believe” that he may be arrested for a non-bailable\\noffence. The use of the expression “reason to believe” shows that the belief\\nthat the applicant may be so arrested must be founded on reasonable\\ngrounds. Mere ‘fear’ is not ‘belief’, for which reason it is not enough for\\nthe applicant to show that he has some sort of a vague apprehension that\\nsome one is going to make an accusation against him, in pursuance of\\nwhich he may be arrested. The grounds on which the belief of the applicant\\nis based that he may be arrested for a non-bailable offence, must be\\ncapable of being examined by the court objectively, because it is then alone\\nthat the court can determine whether the applicant has reason to believe\\nthat he may be so arrested. Section 438(1), therefore, cannot be invoked on\\nthe basis of vague and general allegations, as if to arm oneself in perpetuity\\nagainst a possible arrest. Otherwise, the number of applications for\\nanticipatory bail will be as large as, at any rate, the adult populace.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_95\\\">Anticipatory bail is a device to secure the individuals liberty; it is neither a\\npassport to the commission of crimes nor a shield against any and all kinds\\nof accusations, likely or unlikely\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_165\\\">                                                                                   61</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_96\\\">\\f36. Secondly, if an application for anticipatory bail is made to the High\\nCourt or the Court of Session it must apply its own mind to the question and\\ndecide whether a case has been made out for granting such relief. It cannot\\nleave the question for the decision of the Magistrate concerned under\\nSection 437 of the Code, as and when an occasion arises. Such a course\\nwill defeat the very object of Section 438.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_97\\\">37. Thirdly, the filing of a first information report is not a condition\\nprecedent to the exercise of the power under Section 438. The imminence of\\na likely arrest founded on a reasonable belief can be shown to exist even if\\nan FIR is not yet filed.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_98\\\">38. Fourthly, anticipatory bail can be granted even after an FIR is filed, so\\nlong as the applicant has not been arrested.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_99\\\">39. Fifthly, the provisions of Section 438 cannot be invoked after the arrest\\nof the accused. The grant of “anticipatory bail” to an accused who is under\\narrest involves a contradiction in terms, insofar as the offence or offences\\nfor which he is arrested, are concerned. After arrest, the accused must seek\\nhis remedy under Section 437 or Section 439 of the Code, if he wants to be\\nreleased on bail in respect of the offence or offences for which he is\\narrested.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_100\\\">40. We have said that there is one proposition formulated by the High Court\\nwith which we are inclined to agree. That is proposition (2). We agree that\\na ‘blanket order’ of anticipatory bail should not generally be passed. This\\nflows from the very language of the section which, as discussed above,\\nrequires the applicant to show that he has “reason to believe” that he may\\nbe arrested. A belief can be said to be founded on reasonable grounds only\\nif there is something tangible to go by on the basis of which it can be said\\nthat the applicant&#x27;s apprehension that he may be arrested is genuine. That\\nis why, normally, a direction should not issue under Section 438(1) to the\\neffect that the applicant shall be released on bail “whenever arrested for\\nwhichever offence whatsoever”. That is what is meant by a ‘blanket order’\\nof anticipatory bail, an order which serves as a blanket to cover or protect\\nany and every kind of allegedly unlawful activity, in fact any eventuality,\\nlikely or unlikely regarding which, no concrete information can possibly be\\nhad. The rationale of a direction under Section 438(1) is the belief of the\\napplicant founded on reasonable grounds that he may be arrested for a\\nnon-bailable offence. It is unrealistic to expect the applicant to draw up his\\napplication with the meticulousness of a pleading in a civil case and such is\\nnot requirement of the section. But specific events and facts must be\\ndisclosed by the applicant in order to enable the court to judge of the\\nreasonableness of his belief, the existence of which is the sine qua non of\\nthe exercise of power conferred by the section.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_101\\\">41. Apart from the fact that the very language of the statute compels this\\nconstruction, there is an important principle involved in the insistence that\\nfacts, on the basis of which a direction under Section 438(1) is sought, must\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_166\\\">                                                                                 62</span>\\n\\fbe clear and specific, not vague and general. It is only by the observance of\\nthat principle that a possible conflict between the right of an individual to\\nhis liberty and the right of the police to investigate into crimes reported to\\nthem can be avoided. A blanket order of anticipatory bail is bound to cause\\nserious interference with both the right and the duty of the police in the\\nmatter of investigation because, regardless of what kind of offence is\\nalleged to have been committed by the applicant and when, an order of bail\\nwhich comprehends allegedly unlawful activity of any description\\nwhatsoever, will prevent the police from arresting the applicant even if he\\ncommits, say, a murder in the presence of the public. Such an order can\\nthen become a charter of lawlessness and a weapon to stifle prompt\\ninvestigation into offences which could not possibly be predicated when the\\norder was passed. Therefore, the court which grants anticipatory bail must\\ntake care to specify the offence or offences in respect of which alone the\\norder will be effective. The power should not be exercised in a vacuum.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_102\\\">42. There was some discussion before us on certain minor modalities\\nregarding the passing of bail orders under Section 438(1). Can an order of\\nbail be passed under the section without notice to the Public Prosecutor? It\\ncan be. But notice should issue to the Public Prosecutor or the Government\\nAdvocate forthwith and the question of bail should be re-examined in the\\nlight of the respective contentions of the parties. The ad interim order too\\nmust conform to the requirements of the section and suitable conditions\\nshould be imposed on the applicant even at that stage. Should the operation\\nof an order passed under Section 438(1) be limited in point of time? Not\\nnecessarily. The court may, if there are reasons for doing so, limit the\\noperation of the order to a short period until after the filing of an FIR in\\nrespect of the matter covered by the order. The applicant may in such cases\\nbe directed to obtain an order of bail under Section 437 or 439 of the Code\\nwithin a reasonably short period after the filing of the FIR as aforesaid. But\\nthis need not be followed as an invariable rule. The normal rule should be\\nnot to limit the operation of the order in relation to a period of time.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_103\\\">43. During the last couple of years this Court, while dealing with appeals\\nagainst orders passed by various High Courts, has granted anticipatory\\nbail to many a person by imposing conditions set out in Section 438(2) (i),\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_104\\\">(ii) and (iii). The court has, in addition, directed in most of those cases that\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_105\\\">(a) the applicant should surrender himself to the police for a brief period if\\na discovery is to be made under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_143\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act or that he\\nshould be deemed to have surrendered himself if such a discovery is to be\\nmade. In certain exceptional cases, the court has, in view of the material\\nplaced before it, directed that the order of anticipatory bail will remain in\\noperation only for a week or so until after the filing of the FIR in respect of\\nmatters covered by the order. These orders, on the whole, have worked\\nsatisfactorily, causing the least inconvenience to the individuals concerned\\nand least interference with the investigational rights of the police.

In the light of these decisions, which narrowed the scope and jurisdiction under\\nSection 438, the judgment in Mhetre noticed that Sibbia was by a Bench of five\\njudges, which indicated that imposition of restrictions for granting anticipatory bail\\nwas not always necessary. The court, in Mhetre observed as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_55\\\">      <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_178\\\">“...

According to the report of the\\n      National Police Commission, the power of arrest is grossly abused and\\n      clearly violates the personal liberty of the people, as enshrined under\\n      <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_154\\\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, then the courts need to take serious notice of\\n      it. When conviction rate is admittedly less than 10%, then the police should\\n      be slow in arresting the accused. The courts considering the bail\\n      application should try to maintain fine balance between the societal interest\\n      vis-à-vis personal liberty while adhering to the fundamental principle of\\n      criminal jurisprudence that the accused that the accused is presumed to be\\n      innocent till he is found guilty by the competent court.</span>\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_56\\\">      94.

The court should also examine the\\n      fact whether there is any family dispute between the accused and the\\n      complainant and the complainant must be clearly told that if the complaint\\n      is found to be false or frivolous, then strict action will be taken against him\\n      in accordance with law.

It is imperative for the courts to carefully and with meticulous precision\\nevaluate the facts of the case. The discretion must be exercised on the basis\\nof the available material and the facts of the particular case.

The Constitution Bench in Sibbia&#x27;s\\ncase (supra) has clearly observed that there is no justification for reading\\ninto <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_159\\\">section 438</a> Cr.P.C. and the limitations mentioned in <a href=\\\"/doc/848468/\\\" id=\\\"a_160\\\">section 437</a>\\nCr.P.C. The Court further observed that the plentitude of the section must\\nbe given its full play. The Constitution Bench has also observed that the\\nHigh Court is not right in observing that the accused must make out a\\n“special case” for the exercise of the power to grant anticipatory bail. This\\nvirtually, reduces the salutary power conferred by <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_161\\\">section 438</a> Cr.P.C. to a\\ndead letter. The Court observed that “We do not see why the provisions of\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_162\\\">Section 438</a> Cr.P.C. should be suspected as containing something volatile or\\nincendiary, which needs to be handled with the greatest care and caution\\nimaginable.”\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_113\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_180\\\">99.

Every kind of judicial discretion,\\nwhatever may be the nature of the matter in regard to which it is required to\\nbe exercised, has to be used with due care and caution. In fact, an\\nawareness of the context in which the discretion is required to be exercised\\nand of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of its use, is the hallmark\\nof a prudent exercise of judicial discretion. One ought not to make a\\nbugbear of the power to grant anticipatory bail.</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_114\\\">100. The Constitution Bench in the same judgment also observed that a\\nperson seeking anticipatory bail is still a free man entitled to the\\npresumption of innocence. He is willing to submit to restraints and\\nconditions on his freedom, by the acceptance of conditions which the court\\nmay deem fit to impose, in consideration of the assurance that if arrested,\\nhe shall enlarged on bail.\\n</p>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_181\\\">                                                                                 67</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_115\\\">\\f101. The proper course of action ought to be that after evaluating the\\naverments and accusation available on the record if the court is inclined to\\ngrant anticipatory bail then an interim bail be granted and notice be issued\\nto the public prosecutor. After hearing the public prosecutor the court may\\neither reject the bail application or confirm the initial order of\\ngranting bail. The court would certainly be entitled to impose conditions\\nfor the grant of bail. The public prosecutor or complainant would be at\\nliberty to move the same court for cancellation or modifying the conditions\\nof bail any time if liberty granted by the court is misused. The bail granted\\nby the court should ordinarily be continued till the trial of the case.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_116\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_182\\\">102.

The intention of the legislature is quite clear that the power of grant or\\nrefusal of bail is entirely discretionary. The Constitution Bench in Sibbia&#x27;s\\ncase (supra) has clearly stated that grant and refusal is discretionary and it\\nshould depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The\\nConstitution Bench in the said case has aptly observed that we must respect\\nthe wisdom of the Legislature entrusting this power to the superior courts\\nnamely, the High Court and the Court of Session. The Constitution Bench\\nobserved as under:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_60\\\">       “We would, therefore, prefer to leave the High Court and the\\n       Court of Session to exercise their jurisdiction under Section 438\\n       by a wise and careful use of their discretion which, by their long\\n       training and experience, they are ideally suited to do. The ends of\\n       justice will be better served by trusting these courts to act\\n       objectively and in consonance with principles governing the grant\\n       of bail which are recognized over the years, than by divesting\\n       them of their discretion which the legislature has conferred upon\\n       them, by laying down inflexible rules of general application. It is\\n       customary, almost chronic, to take a statute as one finds it on the\\n       grounds that, after all “the legislature in, its wisdom” has thought\\n       it fit to use a particular expression.

In consonance with\\nthe legislative intention the grant or refusal of anticipatory bail should\\nnecessarily depend on facts and circumstances of each case. As aptly\\nobserved in the Constitution Bench decision in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_181\\\">Sibbia</a>&#x27;s case (supra) that\\nthe High Court or the Court of Sessions to exercise their jurisdiction under\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_191\\\">                                                                                   70</span>\\n\\f<a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_182\\\">section 438</a> Cr.P.C. by a wise and careful use of their discretion which by\\ntheir long training and experience they are ideally suited to do.

The following factors and parameters can be taken into consideration\\nwhile dealing with the anticipatory bail:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_61\\\">i. The nature and gravity of the accusation and the exact role of the accused\\nmust be properly comprehended before arrest is made;\\nii. The antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether the\\naccused has previously undergone imprisonment on conviction by a Court\\nin respect of any cognizable offence;\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_62\\\">iii. The possibility of the applicant to flee from justice;\\niv. The possibility of the accused&#x27;s likelihood to repeat similar or the other\\noffences.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_63\\\">v. Where the accusations have been made only with the object of injuring or\\nhumiliating the applicant by arresting him or her.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_64\\\">vi. Impact of grant of anticipatory bail particularly in cases of large\\nmagnitude affecting a very large number of people.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_65\\\">vii. The courts must evaluate the entire available material against the\\naccused very carefully. The court must also clearly comprehend the exact\\nrole of the accused in the case. The cases in which accused is implicated\\nwith the help of <a href=\\\"/doc/37788/\\\" id=\\\"a_183\\\">sections 34</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/999134/\\\" id=\\\"a_184\\\">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code, the court\\nshould consider with even greater care and caution because over\\nimplication in the cases is a matter of common knowledge and concern;\\nviii. While considering the prayer for grant of anticipatory bail, a balance\\nhas to be struck between two factors namely, no prejudice should be caused\\nto the free, fair and full investigation and there should be prevention of\\nharassment, humiliation and unjustified detention of the accused;\\nix. The court to consider reasonable apprehension of tampering of the\\nwitness or apprehension of threat to the complainant;\\nx. Frivolity in prosecution should always be considered and it is only the\\nelement of genuineness that shall have to be considered in the matter of\\ngrant of bail and in the event of there being some doubt as to the\\ngenuineness of the prosecution, in the normal course of events, the accused\\nis entitled to an order of bail.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_132\\\">123. The arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to those\\nexceptional cases where arresting the accused is imperative in the facts and\\ncircumstances of that case.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_133\\\">124. The court must carefully examine the entire available record and\\nparticularly the allegations which have been directly attributed to the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_192\\\">                                                                                 71</span>\\n\\f      accused and these allegations are corroborated by other material and\\n      circumstances on record.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_134\\\">      125. These are some of the factors which should be taken into consideration\\n      while deciding the anticipatory bail applications. These factors are by no\\n      means exhaustive but they are only illustrative in nature because it is\\n      difficult to clearly visualize all situations and circumstances in which a\\n      person may pray for anticipatory bail. If a wise discretion is exercised by\\n      the concerned judge, after consideration of entire material on record then\\n      most of the grievances in favour of grant of or refusal of bail will be taken\\n      care of. The legislature in its wisdom has entrusted the power to exercise\\n      this jurisdiction only to the judges of the superior courts. In consonance\\n      with the legislative intention we should accept the fact that the discretion\\n      would be properly exercised. In any event, the option of approaching the\\n      superior court against the court of Sessions or the High Court is always\\n      available.”\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_135\\\">12.

Counsel highlighted that anticipatory bail is panacea for apprehension of arrest\\nin false case. Anticipatory bail protects from trauma and stigma of arrest of an\\ninnocent (in most of the cases, full of various responsibilities and even being sole\\nbread earner of her/his family members), consequently prohibiting in creating reverse\\nvictims by way of dependent upon the said accused. An elementary postulate of\\ncriminal jurisprudence is the presumption of innocence, meaning thereby that a person\\nis believed to be innocent until found guilty. However, there are instances in our\\ncriminal law where a reverse onus is placed on an accused with regard to some\\nspecific offences but that is another matter and does not detract from the fundamental\\npostulate in respect of other offences. Yet another important facet of our criminal\\njurisprudence is that the grant of bail is the general rule and putting a person in jail or\\nin a prison or in a correction home (whichever expression one may wish to use) is an\\nexception.

Mohan Rao, learned counsel, emphasized that arrest of an accused,\\nis governed, by Sections 41-46 of the Code. The arrest of an accused, is required, if at\\nall, broadly for unearthing the truth of the case during investigation (a choice of the\\ninvestigating agency) and to secure the presence of accused during trial, for free and\\nfair trial including exclusion of any possibility of influencing of witnesses/and\\ntampering of evidence or aborting a trial by absconding (prerogative of the trail court)\\nor any other means or method known or unknown. Therefore, whether an accused has\\nto be arrested and kept in custody and remains in that state of physical confinement,\\nideally is to be the domain of the prosecuting agency and /or of trying Court. There are\\nsufficient methods enlisted in the Code to ensure this end by both i.e. the prosecuting\\nagency including complainant/victim and also to the concerned court- by filing of\\ncancellation of bail by former and issuance of bailable and non-bailable warrant by the\\nlatter. Counsel argued that in any case, rejection of an application for anticipatory bail,\\nat first instance, does not automatically give rise to evil consequences for an accused\\nto surrender and seek regular bail. The filing of subsequent anticipatory bail and grant\\nof the relief by a competent court of law in a suitable case, upon showing proper and\\ninspiring subsequent chance in circumstances in favour of accused, is sufficient\\nindicative factor of the proposition that a rejection of anticipatory will generate no\\nautomatic warrant for an accused to surrender and seek regular bail. If subsequent and\\nmaterial change or circumstance can be a plausible reason for cancellation of bail, is\\nshould definitely, considering the valuable right of an accused, equally there can be a\\nreason for applying fresh application for anticipatory bail in a suitable case. Having\\nregard to all these factors, counsel urged this court to endorse the reasoning in Mhetre\\nwhich according to him is conformity with the larger bench ruling in Sibbia, and\\naccommodates the flexibilities in the Code.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_167\\\">20.

He also pointed\\nout observations in Gurcharan Singh (supra) to say that statutory bail (i.e. where\\ncharge sheet is not filed in a case within the prescribed period of 60 or 90 days,\\nleading to release by operation of <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_199\\\">Section 167 (2)</a> of the Code 17) amounts to deemed\\nbail under Chapter XXXIII of the Code:\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_83\\\">       “under Section 439 (2) of the new Code a High Court may commit a person\\nreleased on bail under Chapter XXXIII by any Court including the Court of Session to\\ncustody, if it thinks appropriate to do so.

If, however, a Court of Session\\nhad admitted an accused person to bail, the State has two options. it may move the\\nSessions Judge if certain new circumstances have arisen which were not earlier\\nknown to the State and necessarily, therefore, to that Court.

When, however, the State is aggrieved by the order of the\\nSessions Judge granting bail and there are no new circumstances that leave copied up\\nexcept those already existed, it is futile for the State to move the Sessions Judge again\\nand it is competent in law to move the High Court for cancellation of the bail.

In such a situation his bail can be cancelled only if\\n         considerations germane to cancellation of bail under Section 437 (5) or\\n         for that matter Section 439 (2) exist. That is because the release of a\\n         person under Section <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_204\\\">Section 167 (2)</a> is equated to his release under\\n         Chapter XXXIII of the Code.”\\nIt was submitted that therefore, the mere filing of a charge sheet per se cannot be an\\nevent which compels an accused who has the benefit of anticipatory bail, to surrender\\nand seek regular bail.

One, relating to offences in which the maximum\\npunishment can extend to imprisonment for seven year.

Though they have different conditions and thresholds, in both cases it is\\nclear from a bare reading of the section that the power of arrest cannot be exercised in\\never FIR that is registered<a href=\\\"/doc/1980578/\\\" id=\\\"a_208\\\"> u/s 154</a> Cr.PC.

As recognized by the Law Commission, there are cases\\nwhere the power of arrest is not required or allowed to be exercised. Exercising power\\nof arrest in such cases would be a grave violation of a person’s right and liberty. Such\\nexercise of power would amount to misuse of <a href=\\\"/doc/1038208/\\\" id=\\\"a_211\\\">Section 41</a>. The check on the power of\\narrest and custody provided by Sections 437 or 439 is limited as the check is only post\\nfacto. By then the person arrested has already suffered the trauma and humiliation of\\narrest.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_174\\\">25.       Counsel submitted to strike a further balance between the power of arrest and\\nthe rights of the accused, the power under Section 438 is specifically given to the\\nCourt of Session and the High Court so as to ensure that this judicial intervention is\\ndone at the supervisory level and not at the magisterial level. It is in this light that the\\ntwo questions raised in the present reference need to be addressed. It was urged that a\\nbare reading of Section 438 shows that there is nothing in the language of the section\\nwhich goes to show that the pre-arrest bail granted under this section has to be time-\\nbound. The position is the same as in Sections 437 and 439. Counsel pointed to\\nSection 438 (3) and submitted that two important aspects of this provision highlight\\nthe understanding the scheme of the Code:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_88\\\">          a)     A person in whose favour a pre-arrest bail order has been made under\\n          Section 438 has to first be arrested. Such person is then released on bail on the\\n          basis of the pre-arrest bail order. For such release the person has to comply\\n          with the requirement of Section 441 of giving a bond or surety; and\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_89\\\">          b)    Where the magistrate taking cognizance u/s 204 is of the view that a\\n          warrant is required to be issued at the first instance, such magistrate is only\\n          empowered to issue only a bailable warrant and not a non-bailable warrant.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_216\\\">22</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_175\\\">     2014 (8) SCC 273\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_217\\\">23</span>\\n     2003 (2) SCC 649\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_218\\\">                                                                                         83</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_176\\\">\\f26.      This curtailment of power of the magistrate clearly shows Parliamentary intent\\nthat one who is granted relief under Section 438 ought not to be arrested at the stage\\nof cognizance because of the said pre-arrest bail order. Considering this express\\nprovision, no other interpretation can be given to the said section. The second question\\nreferred here squarely covered by this sub-section. This order passed under Section\\n438, is a pre-arrest direction (to release on bail, in the event of arrest), is subject to the\\npower granted to the Court of Session and the High Court under Section 439(2) Cr.\\nP.C.     It is clear from the provision that a bail granted under Section 438 is further\\ngoverned by Section 439(2) which gives the power to the Court of Session or the High\\nCourt to direct the arrest of the accused at any time. This ensures that through judicial\\nintervention the balance between the two competing principles can again be revisited\\nif the need arises. In other words, considering any relevant change in circumstances\\nthe prosecution can seek the arrest of the accused. The only difference is that the\\npower of arrest in these cases is exercised only after judicial scrutiny. This provision\\nenvisions that the Code presupposes that orders once passed under Sections 438 and\\n439 will continue till a contrary order is passed under Section 439(2). The order\\npassed under Sections 438 or 439 are not and temporary or time bound. Therefore, a\\nperson enjoying the benefit of orders under these sections can be taken into custody\\nonly when a specific direction is passed under Section 439(2). This direction for\\narrest under Section 439 (2) is different from seeking cancellation of bail.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_177\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"129162686\\\" id=\\\"span_219\\\">27.

The difference between cancellation of\\nbail and a direction to take a person into custody under Section 439(2) was\\nrecognised. It was also held in this case that if a graver offence is added to the FIR or\\nto the case after the person has been granted bail, a direction under Section 439(2) or\\n437(5) is required before such person can be arrested again for the new offences added\\nto the case. Therefore, this court recognized the need for court’s supervision after the\\nbail had been granted.</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_178\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_224\\\">28.    Mr. Hiren Raval, learned amicus curiae, highlighted that while there are\\npassages in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_214\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra), which support the arguments of the petitioners, that orders\\nunder Section 438 can be unconditional and not limited by time, the court equally\\nstruck a note of caution, and wished courts to be circumspect while making orders of\\nanticipatory bail. In this regard, learned senior counsel highlighted paragraphs 42 and\\n43 of the decisions in Sibbia.</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_179\\\">29.    Elaborating on his submissions, the amicus submitted that whether to impose\\nany conditions or limit the order of anticipatory bail in point of time undoubtedly falls\\nwithin the discretion of the court seized of the application. He however submitted that\\nthis discretion should be exercised with caution and circumspection. Counsel\\nsubmitted that there could be three situations when anticipatory bail applications are to\\nbe considered: one, when the application is filed in anticipation of arrest, before filing\\nFIR; two, after filing FIR, but before the filing of the charge sheet; and three, after\\nfiling charge sheet. It was submitted that as a matter of prudence and for good reasons,\\narticulated in Salauddin, K.L. Verma, Adri Dharan Das and decisions adopting their\\nreasoning, it would be salutary and in public interest for courts to impose time limits\\nfor the life of orders of anticipatory bail. Counsel submitted that if anticipatory bail is\\nsought before filing of an FIR the courts should grant relief, limited till the point in\\ntime, when the FIR is filed. In the second situation, i.e. after the FIR is filed, the court\\nmay limit the grant of anticipatory bail till the point of time when a charge sheet is\\nfiled; in the third situation, if the application is made after filing the charge sheet, it is\\nup to the court, to grant or refuse it altogether, looking at the nature of the charge.\\nLikewise, if arrest is apprehended, the court should consider the matter in an entirely\\ndiscretionary manner, and impose such conditions as may be deemed appropriate.\\n</p>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_225\\\">                                                                                           85</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_180\\\">\\f30.    Mr. Raval submitted that in every contingency, the court is not powerless after\\nthe grant of an order of anticipatory bail; it retains the discretion to revisit the matter if\\nnew material relevant to the issue, is discovered and placed on record before it. He\\nhighlighted Section 439(2) and argued that that provision exemplified the power of the\\ncourt to modify its previous approach and even revoke altogether an earlier order\\ngranting anticipatory bail. It was submitted that the bar under Section 362 of the Code\\n(against review of an order by a criminal court) is inapplicable to matters of\\nanticipatory bail, given the nature and content of the power under Section 439(2).\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_181\\\">31.    Mr. Raval also submitted that power under Section 438 cannot be exercised to\\nundermine any criminal investigation. He highlighted the concern that an\\nunconditional order of anticipatory bail, would be capable of misuse to claim\\nimmunity in a blanket manner, which was never the intent of Parliament. Counsel\\nsubmitted that besides, the discretion of courts empowered to grant anticipatory bail\\nshould be understood as balancing the right to liberty and the public interest in a fair\\nand objective investigation. Therefore, such orders should be so fashioned as to ensure\\nthat accused individuals co-operate during investigations and assist in the process of\\nrecovery of suspect or incriminating material, which they may lead the police to\\ndiscover or recover and which is admissible, during the trial, per <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_215\\\">Section 27</a> of the\\nEvidence Act. He submitted that if these concerns are taken into account, the\\ndeclaration of law in Mhetre – particularly in Paras 122 and 123 that no condition can\\nbe imposed by court, in regard to applications for anticipatory bail, is erroneous; it is\\ncontrary to Para 42 and 43 of the declaration of law in Sibbia’s case (supra). It was\\nemphasized that ever since the decision in Salauddin and other subsequent judgments\\nwhich followed it, the practise of courts generally was to impose conditions while\\ngranting anticipatory bail: especially conditions which required the applicant/ accused\\nto apply for bail after 90 days, or surrender once the charge sheet was filed, and apply\\nfor regular bail. Counsel relied on Section 437(3) to say that the conditions spelt out in\\nthat provision are to be considered, while granting anticipatory bail, by virtue of\\nSection 438(2).\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_182\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1108032\\\" id=\\\"span_226\\\">32.    Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General and Mr. Vikramjit Banerjee,\\nlearned Additional Solicitor General, submitted that the decision in <a href=\\\"/doc/1108032/\\\" id=\\\"a_216\\\">Mhetre</a> (supra) is\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_227\\\">                                                                                           86</span>\\n\\ferroneous and should be overruled. It was submitted that though Section 438 does not\\nper se pre-suppose imposition of conditions for grant of anticipatory bail,\\nnevertheless, given Section 438(2) and Section 437(3), various factors must be taken\\ninto account. Whilst exercising power to grant (or refuse) a direction in the nature of\\nanticipatory bail, the court is bound to strike a balance between the individual&#x27;s right\\nto personal freedom and the right of investigation of the police. For this purpose, in\\ngranting relief under Section 438(1), appropriate conditions can be imposed under\\nSection 438(2) to ensure an unimpeded investigation. The object of imposing\\nconditions is to avoid the possibility of the person or accused hampering investigation.\\nThus, any condition, which has no reference to the fairness or propriety of the\\ninvestigation or trial, cannot be countenanced as permissible under the law.\\nConsequently, courts should exercise their discretion in imposing conditions with care\\nand restraint.</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_183\\\">33.      The law presumes an accused to be innocent till his guilt is proved. As a\\npresumably innocent person, he is entitled to all the fundamental rights including the\\nright to liberty guaranteed under <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_217\\\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Counsel stated that at\\nthe same time, while granting anticipatory bail, the courts are expected to consider and\\nkeep in mind the nature and gravity of accusation, antecedents of the applicant,\\nnamely, about his previous involvement in such offence and the possibility of the\\napplicant to flee from justice. It is also the duty of the Court to ascertain whether\\naccusation has been made with the object of injuring or humiliating him by having\\nhim so arrested. It is needless to mention that the Courts are duty bound to impose\\nappropriate conditions as provided under Section 438(2) of the Code.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_184\\\">34.      Counsel argued that there is no substantial difference between Sections 438 and\\n439 of the Code as regards appreciation of the case while granting or refusing bail.\\nNeither anticipatory bail nor regular bail, however, can be granted as a matter of rule.\\nBeing an extraordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. The\\njudicial discretion conferred upon the court must be properly exercised after proper\\napplication of mind to decide whether it is a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"188505337\\\" id=\\\"span_228\\\">In\\nthis regard, counsel relied on <a href=\\\"/doc/188505337/\\\" id=\\\"a_218\\\">Jai Prakash Singh v State of Bihar26</a>.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1712895\\\" id=\\\"span_229\\\">Counsel relied on\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_230\\\">26</span>\\n     2012 (<a href=\\\"/doc/1712895/\\\" id=\\\"a_219\\\">4) SCC 325\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_231\\\">                                                                                      87</span>\\n\\fState of M.P. &amp; Anr. v Ram Kishna Balothia &amp; Anr.</a> 27 where this court considered the\\nnature of the right of anticipatory bail and observed that:</span>\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_90\\\">          “We find it difficult to accept the contention that <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_220\\\">Section 438</a> of the\\n          Code of Criminal Procedure is an integral part of <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_221\\\">Article 21.</a> In the first\\n          place, there was no provision similar to Section 438 in the old <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_222\\\">Code of\\n          Criminal Procedure</a>......Also anticipatory hail cannot he granted as a\\n          matter of right.

The concept of bail, i.e. preserving the liberty of citizen – even accused of\\ncommitting offences, but subject to conditions, dates back to antiquity. Justinian I in\\nthe collections of laws and interpretations which prevailed in his times, Codex\\nJustinianus (or ‘Code Jus’) in Book 9 titled Title 3(2) stipulated that “no accused\\nperson shall under any circumstances, be confined in prison before he is convicted”.\\nThe second example of a norm of the distant past is the Magna Carta which by clause\\n44 enacted that “people who live outside the forest need not in future appear before\\nthe Royal Justices of the forest in answer to the general summons unless they are\\nactually involved in proceedings or are sureties for someone who has been seized for\\na forest offence.” Clear Parliamentary recognition of bail took shape in later\\nenactments in the UK through the Habeas Corpus Act 1677 and the English Bill of\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_242\\\">                                                                                           90</span>\\n\\fRights, 1689 which prescribed that “excessive bail ought not to be required, nor\\nexcessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted”.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_193\\\">39.    Bail ipso facto has not been defined under the Code. It is now widely\\nrecognized as a norm which includes the governing principles enabling the setting of\\naccused person on liberty subject to safeguards, required to make sure that he is\\npresent whenever needed. The justification for bail (to one accused of commission or\\ncommitting a crime is that it preserves a person who is under cloud of having\\ntransgressed law but not convicted for it, from the rigors of a detention.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_194\\\">40.    <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_231\\\">Section 438</a> of the Cr.PC provides for the issuance of directions for the grant of\\nbail to a person apprehending arrest. The <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_232\\\">Cr.PC</a> of 1973 replaced the old code of 1898.\\nThe old code did not provide for any corresponding provision to Section 438 of the\\ncode of 1973. Under the old code, there was a sharp difference of opinion amongst the\\nvarious High Courts on the question as to whether courts had the inherent power to\\npass an order of bail in anticipation of arrest. The predominant position was that\\ncourts did not have such a power. Subsequently, the need for various amendments to\\nmake the code more comprehensive resulted in the enactment of the <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_233\\\">Code of Criminal\\nProcedure</a> in 1973. Interestingly, Section 438 does not expressly use the term\\n“anticipatory bail”; its language instead empowers the concerned to court to issue\\ndirections for grant of bail.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_195\\\">41.    The Law Commission of India, in its 41st Report of 1969, noted that the\\nnecessity for granting anticipatory bail arises mainly due to influential persons\\nattempting to implicate their rivals in false cases, or disgracing them by getting them\\ndetained in jail. The report further noted that apart from false cases, where there are\\nreasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely to\\nabscond, or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail, there seems to be no\\njustification to require him first to submit to custody, remain in prison for some days\\nand then apply for bail. The report recommended that a provision be included for the\\ndirection to grant bail in such cases, and that this power vest in the High Courts and\\nCourts of Session only. The report, however, did not include the conditions for grant\\nof anticipatory bail in the suggested language for the provision.

The term was used to convey that it\\nwas an application for bail in anticipation of arrest, i.e., before the arrest itself is made.\\nGrant of bail, according to Wharton’s Law Lexicon, and as noticed in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_236\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra),\\nmeans to “set at liberty a person arrested or imprisoned, on security being taken for\\nhis appearance”. Sibbia, observed thus:</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_95\\\">       “The distinction between an ordinary order of bail and an order of\\n       anticipatory bail is that whereas the former is granted after arrest and\\n       therefore means release from the custody of the police, the latter is\\n       granted in anticipation of arrest and is therefore effective at the very\\n       moment of arrest. Police custody is an inevitable concomitant of arrest\\n       for non-bailable offences. An order of anticipatory bail, constitutes, so\\n       to say, an insurance against police custody following upon arrest for\\n       offence or offences in respect of which the order is issued. In other\\n       words, unlike a post-arrest order of bail, it is a pre-arrest legal process\\n       which directs that if the person in whose favour it is issued is thereafter\\n       arrested on the accusation in respect of which the direction is issued, he\\n       shall be released on bail. <a href=\\\"/doc/1494467/\\\" id=\\\"a_237\\\">Section 46(1)</a> of the CrPC which deals with\\n       how arrests are to be made, provides that in making the arrest, the\\n       police officer or other person making the arrest &quot;shall actually touch or\\n       confine the body of the person to be arrested, unless there be a\\n       submission to the custody by word or action&quot;.

One of the arguments raised in Sibbia, as also in the present case, was\\nthat the power to grant anticipatory bail ought to be left to the discretion of the court\\nconcerned, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. The State, on the\\nother hand, argued that the grant of anticipatory bail should at least be conditional\\nupon the bail applicant showing that he is likely to be arrested for an ulterior motive -\\nthat the proposed charges are baseless or motivated by malafides. The State also\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_246\\\">                                                                                           92</span>\\n\\fargued that anticipatory bail is an extraordinary remedy and therefore, whenever it\\nappears that the proposed accusations are prima facie plausible, the applicant should\\nbe left to the ordinary remedy of applying for bail under Section 437 or <a href=\\\"/doc/1290514/\\\" id=\\\"a_239\\\">Section 439</a> of\\nthe Cr.PC, after being arrested.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_198\\\">44.    Counsel for the appellants in Sibbia, on the other hand, argued that since the\\ndenial of bail amounts to deprivation of personal liberty, courts should lean against the\\nimposition of unnecessary restrictions on the scope of Section 438, when no such\\nrestrictions are prescribed by the legislature under that provision. The Court observed\\nthat Section 438(1) is couched in broad and unqualified terms and was of the opinion\\nthat such broad language ought not to be infused with restraints and conditions which\\nthe legislature itself did not think proper or necessary to impose. The court laid\\nemphasis on the primacy of the presumption of innocence in criminal jurisprudence,\\nand observed that Section 438 was not enacted on a clean slate, but rather within the\\ncontext of the existing provisions, Sections 437 (dealing with the power of courts\\nother than the Court of Session and the High Court to grant bail in nonbailable cases)\\nand Section 439 (which deals with the &quot;special powers&quot; of the High Court and the\\nCourt of Session regarding bail). In the light of the relevant extracts of Sibbia, it\\nwould now be worthwhile to recount the relevant observations on the issue. The\\ndiscussion and conclusions in Sibbia are summarized as follows:\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_199\\\">45.    (i) Grant of an order of unconditional anticipatory bail would be “plainly\\ncontrary to the very terms of Section 438.” Even though the terms of Section 438(1)\\nconfer discretion, Section 438(2) “confers on the court the power to include such\\nconditions in the direction as it may think fit in the light of the facts of the particular\\ncase, including the conditions mentioned in clauses (i) to (iv) of that sub-section.”\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_200\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_247\\\">(ii) Grant of an order under Section 438(1) does not per se hamper investigation of an\\noffence; Section 438(1)(i) and (ii) enjoin that an accused/applicant should co-operate\\nwith investigation. <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_240\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) also stated that courts can fashion appropriate\\nconditions governing bail, as well. One condition can be that if the police make out a\\ncase of likely recovery of objects or discovery of facts under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_241\\\">Section 27</a> (of the\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1953529/\\\" id=\\\"a_242\\\">Evidence Act, 1872</a>), the accused may be taken into custody. Given that there is no\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_248\\\">                                                                                        93</span>\\n\\fformal method prescribed by <a href=\\\"/doc/1458526/\\\" id=\\\"a_243\\\">Section 46</a> of the Code if recovery is made during a\\nstatement (to the police) and pursuant to the accused volunteering the fact, it would be\\na case of recovery during “deemed arrest” (Para 19 of Sibbia).</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_201\\\">(iii) The accused is not obliged to make out a special case for grant of anticipatory\\nbail; reading an otherwise wide power would fetter the court’s discretion. Whenever\\nan application (for relief under Section 438) is moved, discretion has to be always\\nexercised judiciously, and with caution, having regard to the facts of every case. (Para\\n21, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_202\\\">(iv) While the power of granting anticipatory bail is not ordinary, at the same time, its\\nuse is not confined to exceptional cases (Para 22, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_203\\\">(v) It is not justified to require courts to only grant anticipatory bail in special cases\\nmade out by accused, since the power is extraordinary, or that several considerations –\\nspelt out in Section 437- or other considerations, are to be kept in mind. (Para 24-25,\\nSibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_204\\\">(vi) Overgenerous introduction (or reading into) of constraints on the power to grant\\nanticipatory bail would render it Constitutionally vulnerable. Since fair procedure is\\npart of <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_244\\\">Article 21</a>, the court should not throw the provision (i.e. Section 438) open to\\nchallenge “by reading words in it which are not to be found therein.” (Para 26).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_205\\\">(vii) There is no “inexorable rule” that anticipatory bail cannot be granted unless the\\napplicant is the target of mala fides. There are several relevant considerations to be\\nfactored in, by the court, while considering whether to grant or refuse anticipatory\\nbail. Nature and seriousness of the proposed charges, the context of the events likely\\nto lead to the making of the charges, a reasonable possibility of the accused’s presence\\nnot being secured during trial; a reasonable apprehension that the witnesses might be\\ntampered with, and “the larger interests of the public or the state” are some of the\\nconsiderations. A person seeking relief (of anticipatory bail) continues to be a man\\npresumed to be innocent. (Para 31, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_249\\\">                                                                                       94</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_206\\\">\\f(viii) There can be no presumption that any class of accused- i.e. those accused of\\nparticular crimes, or those belonging to the poorer sections, are likely to abscond.\\n(Para 32, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_207\\\">(ix)    Courts should exercise their discretion while considering applications for\\nanticipatory bail (as they do in the case of bail). It would be unwise to divest or limit\\ntheir discretion by prescribing “inflexible rules of general application.”. (Para 33,\\nSibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_208\\\">(x)    The apprehension of an applicant, who seeks anticipatory bail (about his\\nimminent or possible arrest) should be based on reasonable grounds, and rooted on\\nobjective facts or materials, capable of examination and evaluation, by the court, and\\nnot based on vague un-spelt apprehensions. (Para 35, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_209\\\">(xi) The grounds for seeking anticipatory bail should be examined by the High Court\\nor Court of Session, which should not leave the question for decision by the concerned\\nMagistrate. (Para 36, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_210\\\">(xii) Filing of FIR is not a condition precedent for exercising power under Section\\n438; it can be done on a showing of reasonable belief of imminent arrest (of the\\napplicant). (Para 37, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_211\\\">(xiii) Anticipatory bail can be granted even after filing of an FIR- as long as the\\napplicant is not arrested. However, after arrest, an application for anticipatory bail is\\nnot maintainable. (Para 38-39, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_212\\\">(xiv) A blanket order under Section 438, directing the police to not arrest the\\napplicant, “wherever arrested and for whatever offence” should not be issued. An\\norder based on reasonable apprehension relating to specific facts (though not spelt out\\nwith exactness) can be made. A blanket order would seriously interfere with the duties\\nof the police to enforce the law and prevent commission of offences in the future.\\n(Para 40-41, Sibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_213\\\">(xv) The public prosecutor should be issued notice, upon considering an application\\nunder Section 438; an ad interim order can be made. The application “should be re-\\n</p>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_250\\\">                                                                                      95</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_214\\\">\\fexamined in the light of the respective contentions of the parties.” The ad interim\\norder too must conform to the requirements of the section and suitable conditions\\nshould be imposed on the applicant even at that stage. “Should the operation of an\\norder passed under Section 438(1) be limited in point of time? Not necessarily. The\\ncourt may, if there are reasons for doing so, limit the operation of the order to a short\\nperiod until after the filing of an FIR in respect of the matter covered by the order. The\\napplicant may in such cases be directed to obtain an order of bail under Section 437\\nor 439 of the Code within a reasonably short period after the filing of the FIR as\\naforesaid. But this need not be followed as an invariable rule. The normal rule should\\nbe not to limit the operation of the order in relation to a period of time.” (Para 42,\\nSibbia).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_215\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_251\\\">46.      It is quite evident, therefore, that the pre-dominant thinking of the larger,\\nConstitution Bench, in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_245\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra), was that given the premium and the value that\\nthe Constitution and <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_246\\\">Article 21</a> placed on liberty- and given that a tendency was\\nnoticed, of harassment – at times by unwarranted arrests, the provision for anticipatory\\nbail was made. It was not hedged with any conditions or limitations- either as to its\\nduration, or as to the kind of alleged offences that an applicant was accused of having\\ncommitted. The courts had the discretion to impose such limitations (likeco-operation\\nwith investigation, not tampering with evidence, not leaving the country etc) as were\\nreasonable and necessary in the peculiar circumstances of a given case. However,\\nthere was no invariable or inflexible rule that the applicant had to make out a special\\ncase, or that the relief was to be of limited duration, in a point of time, or was\\nunavailable for any particular class of offences.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_216\\\">47.

Public Prosecutor32</a> this court observed that\\n         “. … Personal liberty, deprived when bail is refused, is too precious a value\\n         of our constitutional system recognised under <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_252\\\">Article 21</a> that the curial\\n         power to negate it is a great trust exercisable, not casually but judicially,\\n         with lively concern for the cost to the individual and the community. To\\n         glamorise impressionistic orders as discretionary may, on occasions, make\\n         a litigative gamble decisive of a fundamental right. After all, personal\\n         liberty of an accused or convict is fundamental, suffering lawful eclipse\\n         only in terms of “procedure established by law”.</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_219\\\">49.      The reason for enactment of Section 438 in the Code was Parliamentary\\nacceptance of the crucial underpinning of personal liberty in a free and democratic\\ncountry. Parliament wished to foster respect for personal liberty and accord primacy to\\na fundamental tenet of criminal jurisprudence, that everyone is presumed to be\\ninnocent till he or she is found guilty. Life and liberty are the cherished attributes of\\nevery individual. The urge for freedom is natural to each human being. Section 438 is\\na procedural provision concerned with the personal liberty of each individual, who is\\nentitled to the benefit of the presumption of innocence. As denial of bail amounts to\\ndeprivation of personal liberty, the court should lean against the imposition of\\nunnecessary restrictions on the scope of Section 438, especially when not imposed by\\nthe legislature. In Sibbia, it was observed that:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_96\\\">         “Anticipatory bail is a device to secure the individual&#x27;s liberty; it is neither\\n         a passport to the commission of crimes nor a shield against any and all\\n         kinds of accusations, likely or unlikely.”\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_220\\\">50.      The interpretation of Section 438- that it does not encapsulate <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_253\\\">Article 21</a>, is\\nerroneous. This court is of the opinion that the issue is not whether Section 438 is an\\nintrinsic element of <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_254\\\">Article 21:</a> it is rather whether that provision is part of fair\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_258\\\">32</span>\\n     1978 (1) SCC 240\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_259\\\">                                                                                            97</span>\\n\\fprocedure. As to that, there can be no doubt that the provision for anticipatory bail is\\npro-liberty and enables one anticipating arrest, a facility of approaching the court for a\\ndirection that he or she not be arrested; it was specifically enacted as a measure of\\nprotection against arbitrary arrests and humiliation by the police, which Parliament\\nitself recognized as a widespread malaise on the part of the police.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_221\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_260\\\">51.

A fuller consideration of the various decisions cited earlier, especially those\\nwhich emphasized the need to limit the life of an order of anticipatory bail, are\\npremised on the understanding that the grant of an unconditional order of bail would\\nthwart investigation. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"90251163\\\" id=\\\"span_276\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_277\\\">In the first place, this premise is unfounded, given that <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_268\\\">Sibbia</a>\\n(supra) stated (in para 13, SCC reports) that such an order would be “contrary to the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_278\\\">      36</span>\\n        In <a href=\\\"/doc/90251163/\\\" id=\\\"a_269\\\">P.

Nevertheless, an\\nunconditional order, in the sense of an order not even imposing conditions mentioned\\nin Section 438(2) can impede or hamper investigation, <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_272\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) held that the\\nconditions mentioned in that provision should be imposed.

This court cannot lose sight of the fact that the Law Commission’s 41 st and 48th\\nreport focused on the need to introduce the provision (for anticipatory bail) as a\\npreventive, or curative measure, to deal with a particular problem, i.e. unwarranted\\narrests. <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_273\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) noticed this fact, and also that significantly, Section 438 is not\\nhedged with any obligation on the court’s power, to impose conditions. That situation\\nremains unchanged: the provision remains unaltered-at least substantially (barring an\\namendment in 2005 which obliged the issuance of notice to the public prosecutor\\nbefore issuing any order for anticipatory bail)37. The 203rd Report of the Law\\nCommission, which reviewed the entire law on the subject and noticed later decisions,\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_284\\\">37</span>\\n     The amendment, i.e. Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 2005 – which has till\\nnow, not been brought into force, reads as follows:</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_111\\\">                [“(1) Where any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested\\n        on accusation of having committed a non- bailable offence, he may apply to\\n        the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section; that\\n        in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail and the Court may after\\n        taking into consideration inter- alia the following factors namely.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_112\\\">               (i) the nature and gravity of the accusation\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_113\\\">               (ii) the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he\\n        has previously undergone imprisonment on conviction by a Court in respect of\\n        any cognizable offence\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_114\\\">               (iii) the possibility of the applicant to flee from justice and\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_115\\\">              (iv) where the accusation has been made with the object of injuring or\\n        humiliating the applicant by having him so arrested,\\n               either reject the application forthwith or issue an interim order for the\\n        grant of anticipatory bail.\\n</blockquote><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_285\\\">                                                                                      102</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_230\\\">\\fsuch as Salauddin, Adari Narain Das, etc, recommended no change in law on this\\naspect relating to conditions. In this background, it is important to notice that the only\\nbar, or restriction, imposed by Parliament upon the exercise of the power (to grant\\nanticipatory bail) is by way of a positive restriction, i.e. in the case where accused are\\nalleged to have committed offences punishable under          Section 376(3) or Section\\n376AB or Section 376DA or <a href=\\\"/doc/134361871/\\\" id=\\\"a_274\\\">Section 376DB</a> of the Indian Penal Code. In other words,\\nParliament has now denied jurisdiction of the courts (i.e. Court of Session and High\\nCourts) from granting anticipatory bail to those accused of such offences. The\\namendment (Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Act, 2018) introduced Section\\n438(4)) reads as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_116\\\">        &quot;(4) Nothing in this section shall apply to any case involving the arrest of\\n        any person on accusation of having committed an offence under sub-\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_231\\\">        section (3) of section 376 or section 376AB or section 376DA or <a href=\\\"/doc/134361871/\\\" id=\\\"a_275\\\">section\\n        376DB</a> of the Indian Penal Code.&quot;\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_232\\\">              Provided that where the High Court or as the case may be the Court of\\n       Session has not passed any interim order under this sub-section or has rejected\\n       the application for grant of anticipatory bail it shall be open to an officer in\\n       charge of police station to arrest without warrant the applicant on the basis of\\n       the accusation apprehended in such application\\n               (IA) Where the Courts grants an interim order under sub-section (1), it\\n       shall forthwith cause a notice being not less than seven days notice, together\\n       with the copy of such order to be served on the Public Prosecutor and the\\n       Superintendent of Police, with a view to give the Public Prosecutor a\\n       reasonable opportunity of being heard when the application shall be finally\\n       heard by the Court\\n              (IB) The presence of the applicant seeking anticipatory bail shall be\\n       obligatory at the time of final hearing of the application and passing of final\\n       order by the Court, if on an application made to it by the Public Prosecutor, the\\n       Court considers such presence necessary in the interest of justice.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_286\\\">                                                                                     103</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_233\\\">\\f56.    Clearly, therefore, where the Parliament wished to exclude or restrict the power\\nof courts, under Seciton 438 of the Code, it did so in categorical terms. Parliament’s\\nomission to restrict the right of citizens, accused of other offences from the right to\\nseek anticipatory bail, necessarily leads one to assume that neither           a blanket\\nrestriction can be read into by this court, nor can inflexible guidelines in the exercise\\nof discretion, be insisted upon- that would amount to judicial legislation.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_234\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"544985\\\" id=\\\"span_287\\\">57.

The various reasons which led to the imposition of restrictions or limitations by\\nthe decisions noted previously, hinge upon factors such as: addition of graver offences\\nwhich the applicant is alleged to have committed after the grant of anticipatory bail;\\nunearthing of facts disclosing his or her complicity in serious offences, as for instance,\\na conspirator or kingpin; the accused’s non-cooperation in the course of investigation,\\n(such as, for example, difficulty in securing his person, evasion by him, reluctance to\\nanswer questions during the investigation or providing statements for purposes of\\nrecovery of articles in terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_277\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act); involvement in very\\nserious or grave offences such as murder, kidnapping, causing death under unusual\\ncircumstances and offences which undermine the economy; disclosure of information\\nthat the offence involves large scale fraud and several individuals or victims, and, the\\nfiling of charge-sheet. Each of or all of them put together, in the opinion of the court,\\nneither hold insurmountable problem, nor are unforeseen situations or not anticipated\\nin <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_278\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra).</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_236\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_289\\\">59.    The controlling expressions under Section 438(2) spell out three distinct\\nconditions, which the court granting anticipatory bail can include as directions. These\\nare- that the applicant makes himself available for interrogation by police officer, as\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_290\\\">                                                                                     104</span>\\n\\fand when required; that such applicant should not directly or indirectly make any\\ninducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as\\nto dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer; a\\ncondition that the person should not leave India without the permission of the court.\\nFurther conditions as may be deemed essential, may also be imposed by the court,\\nunder Section 437(3). The Court in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_279\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) was alive to the necessity of\\nimposing conditions as is evident from para 13 of its judgment. The court observed\\nthat there was nothing in law which stated that whenever anticipatory bail is granted,\\nit should be without imposing any of those conditions.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_291\\\"><a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_280\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) went on to state\\nthat such unconditional orders would be plainly contrary to the very terms of Section</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_237\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_292\\\">438. The court also noted that though couched in discretionary terms, which means\\nthat the courts could impose those conditions, perhaps viewed pragmatically, they\\nshould do so. What this court in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_281\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) was concerned with, and cautioned\\nother courts against was that the process of construction and interpretation ought not\\nto compel the courts to “cut down by reading into the statute conditions which are not\\nto be found therein.”</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_238\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_293\\\">60.    The context and nature which <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_282\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) considered is that discretion ought\\nto be exercised by the Full Bench judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court\\nwhich cautioned that the power to grant anticipatory bail should be used sparingly and\\nin exceptional cases and that all conditions under Section 437 should be read into in\\nSection 438. Furthermore, the High Court had required that an applicant ought to\\nmake out a special case for grant of anticipatory bail; it was also stated that in cases\\nwherever remand was sought, or a reasonable cause to secure incriminating material\\nin terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_283\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act could be made out, anticipatory bail ought\\nnot to be granted and that it could not be granted in regard to offences punishable with\\ndeath or imprisonment for life unless the court is satisfied that the charge was false or\\ngroundless.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1308768\\\" id=\\\"span_294\\\">The court in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_284\\\">Sibbia</a> (supra) frowned upon imposition of such rules after\\ninterpreting and in the course of the judgment held that the power to grant anticipatory\\nbail is wide and that the discretion is not limited in the manner that the High Court\\nsuggested. At the same time, this court also emphasized that the discretion had to be\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_295\\\">                                                                                     105</span>\\n\\fexercised while granting or refusing to grant in given cases on due application of mind\\nand in a judicious manner.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_239\\\">61.      The imposition of conditions under Section 438(2) with reference to Section\\n437(3), in the opinion of this court, is enough safeguard for the authorities – including\\nthe police and other investigating agencies, who have to investigate into crimes and\\nthe possible complicity of the applicants who seek such relief. Taking each concern,\\ni.e. the addition of more serious offences; presence of a large number of individuals or\\ncomplainants; possibility of non-cooperation - non-cooperation in the investigation or\\nthe requirement of the accused’s statement to aid the recovery of articles and\\nincriminating articles in the course of statements made during investigations – it is\\nnoticeable, significantly, that each of these is contemplated as a condition and is\\ninvariably included in every order granting anticipatory bail. In the event of violation\\nor alleged violation of these, the concerned authority is not remediless; recourse can\\nbe had to Section 438(2) read with Section 437(3). Any violation of these terms would\\nattract a direction to arrest him. This power or direction to arrest is found in Section\\n437(5). However, that provision has no textual application to regular bail granted by\\nthe Court of Sessions or High Courts under Section 439 or directions not to arrest, i.e.\\norder of anticipatory bail under Section 438. Secondly, Section 439(2) which is cast in\\nwide terms, adequately covers situations when an accused does not cooperate during\\nthe investigation or threatens to, or intimidates witness[es] or tries to tamper with\\nother evidence.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_240\\\">62.      It is important to notice, here that there is nothing in the provisions of Section\\n438 which suggests that Parliament intended to restrict its operation, either as regards\\nthe time period, or in terms of the nature of the offences in respect of which, an\\napplicant had to be denied bail, or which special considerations were to apply. In this\\ncontext, it is relevant to recollect that the court would avoid imposing restrictions or\\nconditions in a provision in the absence of an apparent or manifest absurdity, flowing\\nfrom the plain and literal interpretation of the statute (Ref Chandra Mohan v. State of\\nUttar Pradesh &amp; Ors38). <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1149874\\\" id=\\\"span_296\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/1149874/\\\" id=\\\"a_285\\\">Reserve Bank of India v.

The narrower interpretation preferred by this Court - in line of decisions\\nstarting with <a href=\\\"/doc/772627/\\\" id=\\\"a_288\\\">Salauddin</a> (supra) highlighting the concerns with respect to the stages of\\ninvestigation and enquiry and the nature and seriousness of the offence, in the opinion\\nof the Court, ought not to lead one to cutting down the amplitude and the power and\\ndiscretion otherwise available with the Courts. The danger of this Court prescribing\\nthe limitations is that they become inflexible rules or edicts incapable of deviation.\\nInstead, it would be safer to say that where there are circumstances or facts which\\npose peculiar problems or complexities pointing to the seriousness of an offence\\nwhich the accused is implicated in, it is always open to courts (which have to deal\\nwith applications under Section 438) to impose the needed restrictions – be that in\\npoint of time or at the stage of investigation or enquiry. Each of these peculiar\\nconditions may be imposed in the given circumstances of any case, which has those\\ndistinctive or special features. But they should not always be imposed invariably in all\\ncases. In other words, if this Court were to weave conditions to impose and read into\\nSection 438 that are not expressly provided, the danger would be that several\\napplicants who might otherwise be entitled to relief, would be denied it altogether. For\\nexample, the classification of an offence or a category of offences as one wanting\\nspecial treatment where the Courts should not grant relief, would mean that regardless\\nof the role of the accused and the nature of materials shown (whether adequate or not),\\nthe courts would be rendered powerless and denuded of the otherwise amplitude of\\ndiscretion provided by the statute.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_243\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"481284\\\" id=\\\"span_306\\\">66.    As regards the concern expressed on behalf of the state and the Union- that\\nunconditional orders (i.e. those unrelated to a particular time frame) would result in\\nnon-co-operation of the accused, with the investigating officer or authority, or that\\nthere would be reluctance to make statements to the prosecution, to assist in the\\nrecovery of articles that incriminate the accused (and therefore can be used under\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_307\\\">                                                                                     108</span>\\n\\f<a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_289\\\">Section 27</a>, Evidence Act), this court perceives such views to be vague and based\\napparently pre-conceived notions. If there is non-cooperation by an accused – in the\\ncourse of investigation, the remedy of seeking assistance of the court exists.\\nMoreover, on this aspect too, Sibbia had envisioned the situation; the court had cited\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/481284/\\\" id=\\\"a_290\\\">State of U.P. v Deoman Upadhyaya42</a>, where this court had observed as follows:</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_120\\\">         <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"458926\\\" id=\\\"span_308\\\">“When a person not in custody approaches a police officer investigating an\\n         offence and offers to give information leading to the discovery of a fact,\\n         having a bearing on the charge which may be made against him he may\\n         appropriately be deemed to have surrendered himself to the police. <a href=\\\"/doc/706971/\\\" id=\\\"a_291\\\">Section\\n         46</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not contemplate any formality\\n         before a person can be said to be taken in custody : submission to the\\n         custody by word or action by a person in sufficient.

Now, coming to the instruction in some decisions that anticipatory bail should\\nnot be given, or granted with stringent conditions, upon satisfaction that the accused is\\nnot involved, Sibbia, clearly disapproved the imposition of such restrictions, or ruling\\nout of certain offences or adoption of a cautious or special approach. It was held that:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_122\\\">       “A close look at some of the rules in the eight-point code formulated by the\\n       High Court will show how difficult it is to apply them in practice.

And will it be correct to say\\n       that blatantness of the accusation will suffice for rejecting bail, even if the\\n       applicant&#x27;s conduct is painted in colours too lurid to be true? The eighth\\n       proposition rule framed by the High Court says:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_124\\\">       &quot;Mere general allegations of mala fides in the petition are inadequate. The\\n       court must be satisfied on materials before it that the allegations of mala\\n       fide are substantial and the accusation appears to be false and groundless.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_247\\\">       Does this rule mean, and that is the argument of the learned Additional\\n       Solicitor-General, that the anticipatory bail cannot be granted unless it is\\n       alleged (and naturally, also shown, because mere allegation is never\\n       enough) that the proposed accusations are mala fide ? It is understandable\\n       that if mala fides are shown anticipatory bail should be granted in the\\n       generality of cases. But it is not easy to appreciate why an application for\\n       anticipatory bail must be rejected unless the accusation is shown to be mala\\n       fide. This, truly, is the risk involved in framing rules by judicial\\n       construction. Discretion, therefore, ought to be permitted to remain in the\\n       domain of discretion, to be exercised objectively and open to correction by\\n       the higher courts. The safety of discretionary power lies in this twin\\n       protection which provides a safeguard against its abuse.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_248\\\">       According to the sixth proposition framed by the High Court, the discretion\\n       under Section 438cannot be exercised in regard to offences punishable with\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_315\\\">                                                                                     110</span>\\n\\f      death or imprisonment for life unless, the court at the stage of granting\\n      anticipatory bail, is satisfied that such a charge appears to be false or\\n      groundless. Now, Section 438 confers on the High Court and the Court of\\n      Session the power to grant anticipatory bail if the applicant has reason to\\n      believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed &quot;a\\n      non-bailable offence&quot;. We see no warrant for reading into this provision the\\n      conditions subject to which bail can be granted under Section 437 (1) of the\\n      Code. That section, while conferring the power to grant bail in cases of\\n      non-bailable offences, provides by way of an exception that a person\\n      accused or suspected of the commission of a non-bailable offence &quot;shall not\\n      be so released&quot; if there appear to be reasonable grounds for believing that\\n      he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for\\n      life. If it was intended that the exception contained in Section 437\\n      (1) should govern the grant of relief under Section 438 (1), nothing would\\n      have been easier for the legislature than to introduce into the latter section\\n      a similar provision. We have already pointed out the basic distinction\\n      between these two sections. Section 437 applies only after a person, who is\\n      alleged to have committed a non-bailable offence, is arrested or detained\\n      without warrant or appears or is brought before a court. Section\\n      438 applies before the arrest is made and, in fact, one of the pre-conditions\\n      of its application is that the person, who applies for relief under it, must be\\n      able to show that he has reason to believe that &quot;he may be arrested&quot;, which\\n      plainly means that he is not yet arrested. The nexus which this distinction\\n      bears with the grant or refusal of bail is that in cases falling under Section\\n      437, there is some concrete data on the basis of which it is possible to show\\n      that there appear to be reasonable grounds for believing that the applicant\\n      has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for\\n      life. In cases falling under Section 438 that stage is still to arrive and, in the\\n      generality of cases thereunder, it would be premature and indeed difficult to\\n      predicate that there are or are not reasonable grounds for so believing. The\\n      foundation of the belief spoken of in Section 437 (1), by reason of which the\\n      court cannot release the applicant on bail is, normally, the credibility of the\\n      allegations contained in the First Information Report.”\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_249\\\">68.   For the above reasons, the answer to the first question in the reference made to\\nthis bench is that there is no offence, per se, which stands excluded from the purview\\nof Section 438, - except the offences mentioned in Section 438 (4). In other words,\\nanticipatory bail can be granted, having regard to all the circumstances, in respect of\\nall offences. At the same time, if there are indications in any special law or statute,\\nwhich exclude relief under Section 438 (1) they would have to be duly considered.\\nAlso, whether anticipatory offences should be granted, in the given facts and\\ncircumstances of any case, where the allegations relating to the commission of\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_316\\\">                                                                                       111</span>\\n\\foffences of a serious nature, with certain special conditions, is a matter of discretion to\\nbe exercised, having regard to the nature of the offences, the facts shown, the\\nbackground of the applicant, the likelihood of his fleeing justice (or not fleeing\\njustice); likelihood of co-operation or non-co-operation with the investigating agency\\nor police, etc. There can be no inflexible time frame for which an order of anticipatory\\nbail can continue.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_250\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"772627\\\" id=\\\"span_317\\\">69.    Therefore, this court holds that the view expressed in <a href=\\\"/doc/772627/\\\" id=\\\"a_300\\\">Salauddin Abdulsamad\\nShaikh, K.L. Verma, Nirmal Jeet Kaur, Satpal Singh, Adri Dharan Das, HDFC Bank,\\nJ.J. Manan and Naresh Kumar Yadav</a> (supra) about the Court of Sessions, or the High\\nCourt, being obliged to grant anticipatory bail, for a limited duration, or to await the\\ncourse of investigation, so as the “normal court” not being “bye passed” or that in\\ncertain kinds of serious offences, anticipatory bail should not be granted normally-\\nincluding in economic offences, etc are not good law. The observations – which\\nindicate that such time related or investigative event related conditions, should\\ninvariably be imposed at the time of grant of anticipatory bail are therefore, overruled.\\nSimilarly, the observations in Mhetre that “the courts should not impose restrictions\\non the ambit and scope of <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_301\\\">section 438</a> Cr.P.C. which are not envisaged by the\\nLegislature. The court cannot rewrite the provision of the statute in the garb of\\ninterpreting it” is too wide and cannot be considered good law. It is one thing to say\\nthat as a matter of law, ordinarily special conditions (not mentioned in Section 438 (2)\\nread with Section 437 (3) should not be imposed; it is an entirely different thing to say\\nthat in particular instances, having regard to the nature of the crime, the role of the\\naccused, or some peculiar feature, special conditions should not be imposed. The\\njudgment in Sibbia itself is an authority that such conditions can be imposed, but not\\nin a routine or ordinary manner and that such conditions then become an inflexible\\n“formula” which the courts would have to follow. Therefore, courts and can, use their\\ndiscretion, having regard to the offence, the peculiar facts, the role of the offender,\\ncircumstances relating to him, his likelihood of subverting justice (or a fair\\ninvestigation), likelihood of evading or fleeing justice- to impose special conditions.\\nImposing such conditions, would have to be on a case to case basis, and upon exercise\\nof discretion by the court seized of the application under Section 438. In conclusion, it\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_318\\\">                                                                                      112</span>\\n\\fis held that imposing conditions such as those stated in Section 437 (2) while granting\\nbail, are normal; equally, the condition that in the event of the police making out a\\ncase of a likely discovery under <a href=\\\"/doc/1312051/\\\" id=\\\"a_302\\\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, person released on\\nbail shall be liable to be taken in police custody for facilitating the discovery. Other\\nconditions, which are restrictive, are not mandatory; nor is there any invariable rule\\nthat they should necessarily be imposed or that the anticipatory bail order would be for\\na time duration, or be valid till the filing of the FIR, or the recording of any statement\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/357596/\\\" id=\\\"a_303\\\">Section 161</a>, Cr.

The question here is whether there is anything in the law which per se requires\\nthat upon filing of the charge-sheet, or the summoning of the accused, by the court –\\n(or even the addition of an offence in the charge-sheet, of which an applicant on bail\\nis accused of freshly), his liberty ought to be forfeited and that he should be asked to\\nsurrender and apply for regular bail. The observations about the width and amplitude\\nof the power under Section 438, made in answer to the first question, are equally\\nrelevant here too. In the present context, further, the judgment and observations of this\\nCourt in its interpretation of <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_304\\\">Section 167(2)</a> are telling. It was held in <a href=\\\"/doc/1308768/\\\" id=\\\"a_305\\\">Gursharan\\nSingh</a> (supra), the release by grant of bail of an accused under <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_306\\\">Section 167(2)</a> amounts\\nto “deemed bail”.</span> This is borne out by <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_307\\\">Section 167(2)</a> which states that anyone\\nreleased on bail under its provision “shall be deemed to be so released under the\\nprovisions of Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter.” The judgment in\\nAslam Babalal Desai (supra) has clarified that when an accused is released by\\noperation of <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_308\\\">Section 167(2)</a> and subsequently, a charge-sheet is filed, there is no\\nquestion of the cancellation of his bail. In these circumstances, the mere fact that an\\naccused is given relief under Section 438 at one stage, per se does not mean that upon\\nthe filing of a charge-sheet, he is necessarily to surrender or/and apply for regular bail.\\nThe analogy to ‘deemed bail’ under <a href=\\\"/doc/593844/\\\" id=\\\"a_309\\\">Section 167(2)</a> with anticipatory bail leads this\\ncourt to conclude that the mere subsequent event of the filing of a charge-sheet cannot\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_320\\\">                                                                                      113</span>\\n\\fcompel the accused to surrender and seek regular bail. As a matter of fact,\\ninterestingly, if indeed, if a charge-sheet is filed where the accused is on anticipatory\\nbail, the normal implication would be that there was no occasion for the investigating\\nagency or the police to require his custody, because there would have been nothing in\\nhis behavior requiring such a step. In other words, an accused, who is granted\\nanticipatory bail would continue to be at liberty when the charge sheet is filed, the\\nnatural implication is that there is no occasion for a direction by the Court that he be\\narrested and further that he had cooperated with the investigation. At the same time,\\nhowever, at any time during the investigation were any occasion to arise calling for\\nintervention of the court for infraction of any of the conditions imposed under Section\\n437(3) read with Section 438(2) or the violation of any other condition imposed in the\\ngiven facts of a case, recourse can always be had under Section 439(2).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_253\\\">71.    Section 438 (3) states that when a person is granted anticipatory bail, is later\\narrested without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station “on such\\naccusation”, and is willing to give bail, “he shall be released on bail; and if a\\nMagistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should issue in\\nthe first instance against that person he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity\\nwith the direction of the Court under sub-section (1)”. The order granting anticipatory\\nbail, is also- as noticed earlier, and in several previous decisions, a “direction” under\\nthis Section 438 “that in the event of such arrest” the applicant be released on bail.\\nTherefore, when an accused in fact is granted bail, and the conditions outlined in\\nSection 438 (2) are included as part of the direction “to release” him in the event of\\narrest, all the necessary conditions which he is obliged to follow exist. Section 438 (3)\\noutlines the steps to be taken, in the event of arrest of one who has been granted relief\\nunder Section 438 (1). In the event of non-compliance with any or all conditions,\\nimposed by the court, the concerned agency or the police, a direction can be sought\\nfrom the court under Section 439 (2).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_254\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"129162686\\\" id=\\\"span_321\\\">72.    The view that this court expresses about the prosecution’s option to apply for a\\ndirection to arrest the accused, finds support in <a href=\\\"/doc/129162686/\\\" id=\\\"a_310\\\">Pradeep Ram</a> (supra) where this court\\nheld as follows:</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_322\\\">                                                                                     114</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_125\\\">\\f“21. Both Sections 437 (5) and 439 (2) empowers the Court to arrest an\\naccused and commit him to custody, who has been released on bail under\\nChapter XXXIII. There may be numerous grounds for exercise of power\\nunder 437 (5) and 439 (2). The principles and grounds for cancelling a bail\\nare well settled, but in the present case, we are concerned only with one\\naspect of the matter, i.e., a case where after accused has been granted the\\nbail, new and serious offences are added in the case. A person against\\nwhom serious offences have been added, who is already on bail can very\\nwell be directed to be arrested and committed to custody by the Court in\\nexercise of power under 437 (5) and 439 (2). Cancelling the bail granted to\\nan accused and directing him to arrest and taken into custody can be one\\ncourse of the action, which can be adopted while exercising power\\nunder 437 (5) and 439 (2), but there may be cases where without cancelling\\nthe bail granted to an accused, on relevant consideration, Court can direct\\nthe accused to be arrested and committed to custody. The addition of\\nserious offences is one of such circumstances, under which the Court can\\ndirect the accused to be arrested and committed to custody despite the bail\\nhaving been granted with regard to the offences with which he was charged\\nat the time when bail was considered and granted.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_126\\\">                     ********       ********      ********\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_127\\\">25. We may have again to look into provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/268728/\\\" id=\\\"a_311\\\">Sections 437 (5)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/116391/\\\" id=\\\"a_312\\\">439\\n(2)</a> of Cr.P.C. Sub-section (5) of <a href=\\\"/doc/848468/\\\" id=\\\"a_313\\\">Sections 437</a> of Cr.P.C uses expression ‘if it\\nconsiders it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested and commit\\nhim to custody’. Similarly, sub-section (2) of <a href=\\\"/doc/1290514/\\\" id=\\\"a_314\\\">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. provides:\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_128\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"475211\\\" id=\\\"span_323\\\">‘may direct that any person who has been released on bail under this Chapter\\nbe arrested and commit him to custody’. A plain reading of the aforesaid\\nprovisions indicates that provision does not mandatorily provide that the Court\\nbefore directing arrest of such accused who has already been granted bail\\nmust necessary cancel his earlier bail. A discretion has been given to the\\nCourt to pass such orders to direct for such person be arrested and commit\\nhim to the custody which direction may be with an order for cancellation of\\nearlier bail or permission to arrest such accused due to addition of graver and\\nnon- cognizable offences.

Relying on the above said order, learned counsel for the appellant\\nsubmits that respondent State ought to get first the order dated 10.03.2016\\ngranting bail to appellant cancelled before seeking custody of the\\nappellant. It may be true that by mere addition of an offence in a criminal\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_324\\\">                                                                              115</span>\\n\\fcase, in which accused is bailed out, investigating authorities itself may not\\nproceed to arrest the accused and need to obtain an order from the Court,\\nwhich has released the accused on the bail. It is also open for the accused,\\nwho is already on bail and with regard to whom serious offences have been\\nadded to apply for bail in respect of new offences added and the Court after\\napplying the mind may either refuse the bail or grant the bail with regard to\\nnew offences. In a case, bail application of the accused for newly added\\noffences is rejected, the accused can very well be arrested. In all cases,\\nwhere accused is bailed out under orders of the Court and new offences are\\nadded including offences of serious nature, it is not necessary that in all\\ncases earlier bail should be cancelled by the Court before granting\\npermission to arrest an accused on the basis of new offences. The power\\nunder Sections 437 (5) and 439 (2) are wide powers granted to the court by\\nthe Legislature under which Court can permit an accused to be arrested\\nand commit him to custody without even cancelling the bail with regard to\\nearlier offences. Sections 437 (5) and 439 (2) cannot be read into restricted\\nmanner that order for arresting the accused and commit him to custody can\\nonly be passed by the Court after cancelling the earlier bail.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_131\\\">28. Coming back to the present case, the appellant was already into jail\\ncustody with regard to another case and the investigating agency applied\\nbefore Special Judge, NIA Court to grant production warrant to produce\\nthe accused before the Court. The Special Judge having accepted the\\nprayer of grant of production warrant, the accused was produced before the\\nCourt on 26.06.2018 and remanded to custody. Thus, in the present case,\\nproduction of the accused was with the permission of the Court. Thus, the\\npresent is not a case where investigating agency itself has taken into\\ncustody the appellant after addition of new offences rather accused was\\nproduced in the Court in pursuance of production warrant obtained from\\nthe Court by the investigating agency. We, thus do not find any error in the\\nprocedure which was adopted by the Special Judge, NIA Court with regard\\nto production of appellant before the Court. In the facts of the present case,\\nit was not necessary for the Special Judge to pass an order cancelling the\\nbail dated 10.03.2016 granted to the appellant before permitting the\\naccused appellant to be produced before it or remanding him to the judicial\\ncustody.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_132\\\">29.

These are important for the court which considering the\\n   application, to extent and reasonableness of the threat or apprehension, its\\n   gravity or seriousness and the appropriateness of any condition that may\\n   have to be imposed. It is not a necessary condition that an application\\n   should be moved only after an FIR is filed; it can be moved earlier, so long\\n   as the facts are clear and there is reasonable basis for apprehending arrest.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_140\\\">(b)   The court, before which an application under Section 438, is filed,\\n   depending on the seriousness of the threat (of arrest) as a measure of\\n   caution, may issue notice to the public prosecutor and obtain facts, even\\n   while granting limited interim anticipatory bail.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_141\\\">(c) Section 438 Cr.

The history of our republic – and indeed, the freedom movement has shown\\nhow the likelihood of arbitrary arrest and indefinite detention and the lack of\\nsafeguards played an important role in rallying the people to demand independence.\\nWitness the Rowlatt Act, the nationwide protests against it, the Jallianwalla Bagh\\nmassacre and several other incidents, where the general public were exercising their\\nright to protest but were brutally suppressed and eventually jailed for long. The\\nspecter of arbitrary and heavy-handed arrests: too often, to harass and humiliate\\ncitizens, and oftentimes, at the interest of powerful individuals (and not to further any\\nmeaningful investigation into offences) led to the enactment of Section 438. Despite\\nseveral Law commission reports and recommendations of several committees and\\ncommissions, arbitrary and groundless arrests continue as a pervasive phenomenon.\\nParliament has not thought it appropriate to curtail the power or discretion of the\\ncourts, in granting pre-arrest or anticipatory bail, especially regarding the duration, or\\ntill charge sheet is filed, or in serious crimes. Therefore, it would not be in the larger\\ninterests of society if the court, by judicial interpretation, limits the exercise of that\\npower: the danger of such an exercise would be that in fractions, little by little, the\\ndiscretion, advisedly kept wide, would shrink to a very narrow and unrecognizably\\ntiny portion, thus frustrating the objective behind the provision, which has stood the\\ntest of time, these 46 years.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_276\\\">81.

Whether to\\n\\n  grant or not is a matter of discretion; equally whether and if\\n\\n  so, what kind of special conditions are to be imposed (or not\\n\\n  imposed) are dependent on facts of the case, and subject to\\n\\n  the discretion of the court.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_365\\\">                                                                 129</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_287\\\">\\f(5) Anticipatory bail granted can, depending on the conduct and\\n\\n  behavior of the accused, continue after filing of the charge\\n\\n  sheet till end of trial.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_288\\\">(6) An order of anticipatory bail should not be “blanket” in the\\n\\n  sense that it should not enable the accused to commit further\\n\\n  offences and claim relief of indefinite protection from arrest. It\\n\\n  should be confined to the offence or incident, for which\\n\\n  apprehension of arrest is sought, in relation to a specific\\n\\n  incident.
