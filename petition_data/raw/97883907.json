The proceedings against the appellants have their origin in\\n\\nan FIR, bearing CR No.4/2018 dated 8 th January 2018\\n\\nregistered   with     Vishrambaug      Police    Station,    Pune,\\n\\nMaharashtra. The informant is one Tushar Ramesh Damgude.\\n\\nThe incident which prompted filing of the FIR was in relation to\\n\\na programme at Shaniwar Wada, Pune held on 31st December\\n\\n2017. The organisers for this event- Elgar Parishad, were\\n\\nactivists of Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation. There\\n\\nwere various events in connection with the said programme,\\n\\nwhich according to the prosecution, were provocative in nature\\n\\nand had the effect of creating enmity between caste groups\\n\\nleading to violence and loss of life, as also state wide agitation.\\n\\nThere were books kept at the venue, which, according to the\\n\\nmaker of the FIR were also provocative. There were incidents of\\n\\nviolence, arson, and stone pelting near Bhima-Koregaon and six\\n\\nmembers of Kabir Kala Manch and other associates were named\\n\\nas accused in the FIR. The appellants did not feature in the\\n\\nFIR. The scope of the investigation was subsequently expanded,\\n\\nas we find in the judgment giving rise to Criminal Appeal\\n\\nNo.639 of 2023 on 17th April 2018 the Pune Police conducted\\n\\nsearches at the residences of eight individuals, i.e. (1) Rona\\n\\nWilson of Delhi, (2) Surendra Gadling of Nagpur, (3) Sudhir\\n                                                            3 | Page\\n\\fDhawale of Mumbai, (4) Harshali Potdar of Mumbai, (5) Sagar\\n\\nGorkhe (also referred to as Sagar Gorakhe by the prosecution)\\n\\nof Pune, (6) Deepak Dhengale of Pune, (7) Ramesh Gaichor of\\n\\nPune and (8) Jyoti Jagtap of Pune. The residences of Shoma\\n\\nSen and Mahesh Sitaram Raut, who have also been implicated\\n\\nin the same case, were searched on 6 th June 2018. It has been\\n\\nargued by the NIA that during the searches, electronic devices\\n\\nand documents apart from other materials were recovered and\\n\\nthe seized articles were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory\\n\\n(“FSL”) for analysis. Cloned copies thereof, according to the\\n\\nprosecution, revealed incriminating materials. The appellants’\\n\\nnames did not also figure in the initial chargesheet dated 15 th\\n\\nNovember 2018, which implicated ten individuals as accused.\\n\\nAmong them were Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Shoma\\n\\nSen, Mahesh Raut and Rona Wilson, who were in detention at\\n\\nthat point of time. Rest five accused persons were absconding at\\n\\nthat point of time. We are informed by Mr. Nataraj that one of\\n\\nthe absconding accused, Milind Teltumbde, has since passed\\n\\naway.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">4.   Searches were conducted at the residences/workplaces of\\n\\nthe appellants and they were arrested on the same day, i.e. on\\n\\n\\n                                                        4 | Page\\n\\f28th August 2018. They were initially put under house arrest\\n\\nand subsequently sent to judicial custody. Case of the NIA is\\n\\nthat various letters and other materials recovered from the\\n\\narrested co-accused persons including Surendra Gadling and\\n\\nRona   Wilson   showed    appellants’   involvement   with   the\\n\\nCommunist Party of India (Maoist). This organisation has been\\n\\nplaced in the First Schedule to the 1967 Act as a terrorist\\n\\norganisation by a notification dated 22 nd June 2009 issued in\\n\\nterms of <a href=\\\"/doc/848897/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Section 2(m)</a> of the 1967 Act. Prosecution’s case is that\\n\\nthe appellants played an active role in recruitment of and\\n\\ntraining for cadres of the said organisation and Arun Ferreira\\n\\n(whom we shall refer to henceforth as AF), being the appellant\\n\\nin Criminal Appeal No.640 of 2023 also had role in managing\\n\\nfinances of that organisation. The other accused persons who\\n\\nwere detained in the third phase were P. Varavara Rao and\\n\\nSudha Bharadwaj.      Among them, we are apprised by the\\n\\nlearned senior counsel for the appellants, Ms. Rebecca John\\n\\nappearing for Vernon Gonsalves (VG in short), being the\\n\\nappellant in Criminal Appeal No.639 of 2023 and Mr. R. Basant\\n\\n(representing AF) that, P. Varavara Rao has been enlarged on\\n\\nbail by an order of this Court passed on 10 th August 2022.\\n\\nSudha Bharadwaj is on “default bail” granted by the Bombay\\n                                                         5 | Page\\n\\fHigh Court on 1st September 2021. Petition for special leave to\\n\\nappeal against that order was rejected by a three-Judge Bench\\n\\nof this Court on 7th December 2021. Gautam Navlakha, as per\\n\\ninformation made available before this Court, is under house\\n\\narrest. Another supplementary chargesheet has been submitted\\n\\non 21st February 2019 by the State police implicating the\\n\\nappellants, along with other co-accused persons for commission\\n\\nof aforesaid offences under the 1967 Act and the 1860 Code. On\\n\\n9th October 2020, NIA had filed a further supplementary\\n\\nchargesheet against, inter-alia, Dr. Anand Teltumbde, Gautam\\n\\nNavlakha, Hany Babu, Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor, Jyoti\\n\\nJagtap, Stan Swami (since deceased) and Milind Teltumbde\\n\\n(since deceased) broadly under the same provisions of the 1860\\n\\nCode and the 1967 Act. Barring deceased Milind Teltumbde, all\\n\\nthese individuals had been arrested. Among them, Dr. Anand\\n\\nTeltumbde has been released on bail by the Bombay High Court\\n\\nand the judgment to that effect was delivered on 18 th November\\n\\n2022. The petition for special leave to appeal against that\\n\\ndecision has been dismissed by a coordinate Bench of this\\n\\nCourt on 25th November 2022. VG, it transpires from his\\n\\npleadings, is a writer, columnist and has been vocal on issues of\\n\\nhuman rights, prison rights and reform of the criminal justice\\n                                                         6 | Page\\n\\fsystem. AF has described himself as a practising Advocate of\\n\\nthe Bombay High Court as also a cartoonist and a human\\n\\nrights activist.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">5.   After the arrest of the appellants, a writ petition was filed\\n\\nbefore this Court [Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 260/2018-\\n\\nRomila Thapar and Ors. -vs- Union of India and Ors.]. One of\\n\\nthe prayers in this petition was for direction of immediate\\n\\nrelease of all activists arrested in connection with the Bhima\\n\\nKoregaon violence.     Direction was also sought for staying any\\n\\narrest until the matter was fully investigated and decided by\\n\\nthis Court. That writ petition was dismissed on 28 th September\\n\\n2018 (by a 2:1 majority). The majority view was that it was not\\n\\na case of arrest because of expression of mere dissenting views\\n\\nor difference in political ideology of the named accused, but\\n\\nconcerning their links with the members of the banned\\n\\norganisation.      At that stage, the Court did not go into an\\n\\nexercise of evaluating the materials brought before it.      This\\n\\nfinding or observation, however, cannot aid the prosecution in a\\n\\nregular application for bail, the appeals in respect of which we\\n\\nare adjudicating.     The Court deciding on specific plea of the\\n\\nappellants for bail is required to independently apply its mind\\n\\n\\n                                                          7 | Page\\n\\fand examine the materials placed before it for determining the\\n\\nquestion of granting bail to the individual applicants.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">6.   As the charges against the appellants include commission\\n\\nof offences under different Sections of the 1967 Act, including\\n\\nthose coming within Chapters IV and VI thereof, the restriction\\n\\non grant of bail as contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/165949346/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Section 43D (5)</a> of the said Act\\n\\nwould apply in their cases. We shall also refer to the ratio of the\\n\\njudgment of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of\\n\\nUnion of India -vs- K.A. Najeeb [(2021) 3 SCC 713] while\\n\\nexamining the appellants’ cases in the backdrop of the aforesaid\\n\\nprovision. In this judgment, it has been held that such\\n\\nstatutory restrictions, per se, do not oust the jurisdiction of the\\n\\nConstitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of\\n\\nPart III of the Constitution of India and it would be within the\\n\\njurisdiction of the Constitutional Courts, i.e., this Court and\\n\\nthe High Courts to relax the rigours of such provisions, where\\n\\nthere is no likelihood of trial being completed within a\\n\\nreasonable time and the period of incarceration a detenue has\\n\\nalready undergone, covers a substantial part of the prescribed\\n\\nsentences for the offences with which the latter has been\\n\\ncharged. This ratio has been relied upon by the learned counsel\\n\\n\\n                                                           8 | Page\\n\\ffor the appellants. Other authorities cited on this point are\\n\\nThwaha Fasal -vs- Union of India [2021 SCC OnLine SC 1000]\\n\\nand Angela Harish Sontakke -vs- State of Maharashtra\\n\\n[(2021) 3 SCC 723]. On general proposition of law on the aspect\\n\\nof grant of bail due to delay in trial, the case of Sagar Tatyaram\\n\\nGorkhe and Another -vs- State of Maharashtra [(2021) 3 SCC\\n\\n725] has been relied upon. In course of hearing, we were\\n\\napprised by the appellants’ counsel that charges against the\\n\\nappellants are yet to be framed.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">7.   We have referred to the case of Dr. Anand Teltumbde, who\\n\\nwas added as an accused in relation to the same case on 23 rd\\n\\nAugust 2018 and has subsequently enlarged on bail. His name,\\n\\naccording to the prosecution, had surfaced from digital devices\\n\\nand other articles seized by the police, in the expanded phase of\\n\\ninvestigation. Dr. Anand Teltumbde had surrendered on 14 th\\n\\nApril 2020 after his plea for pre-arrest bail was rejected.\\n\\nSubsequently, however, he has been released on bail.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">8.   Arguments have been advanced before us on the question\\n\\nas to whether mere membership of a banned organisation\\n\\nconstitutes an offence or not. On behalf of the appellants’\\n\\nreliance was placed on the prevailing view that the same would\\n\\n                                                          9 | Page\\n\\fnot be sufficient to constitute an offence under the 1967 Act or\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/17848451/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987</a>\\n\\n(which statute also has similar provisions) unless it is\\n\\naccompanied with some overt offending act. A three Judge-\\n\\nBench of this Court in the case of Arup Bhuyan -vs- State of\\n\\nAssam and Another [2023 SCC OnLine SC 338] has held that\\n\\nif a person, even after an organisation is declared as an\\n\\nunlawful association, continues to be a member thereof, would\\n\\nattract penalty under <a href=\\\"/doc/448101/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Section 10</a> of the 1967 Act.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">9.   Barring <a href=\\\"/doc/1214158/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Section 13</a>, all the offences with which the\\n\\nappellants have been charged with under the 1967 Act fall\\n\\nwithin Chapters IV and VI of the said statute. This is apart from\\n\\nthe offences under the 1860 Code. Hence, there is a duty of the\\n\\nCourt to form an opinion on perusal of the case diary or the\\n\\nreport made under <a href=\\\"/doc/1412034/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Section 173</a> of the Code of Criminal\\n\\nProcedure, 1973 (“1973 Code”) that there are reasonable\\n\\ngrounds for believing that the accusations against such persons\\n\\nare prima facie true while considering the prayer for bail, to\\n\\nreject prayers for bail of the appellants. The manner in which\\n\\nthe Court shall form such opinion has been laid down by this\\n\\nCourt in the case of National Investigation Agency -vs-\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">                                                        10 | P a g e\\n\\fZahoor Ahmad Shah Watali [(2019) 5 SCC 1]. It has been held\\n\\nin this judgment:-\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">          &quot;23. By virtue of the proviso to sub-section (5), it is the\\n          duty of the Court to be satisfied that there are\\n          reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation\\n          against the accused is prima facie true or otherwise.\\n          Our attention was invited to the decisions of this Court,\\n          which has had an occasion to deal with similar special\\n          provisions in TADA and MCOCA. The principle\\n          underlying those decisions may have some bearing\\n          while considering the prayer for bail in relation to the\\n          offences under the 1967 Act as well. Notably, under the\\n          special enactments such as TADA, MCOCA and the\\n          Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985,\\n          the Court is required to record its opinion that there are\\n          reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is\\n          “not guilty” of the alleged offence. There is a degree of\\n          difference between the satisfaction to be recorded by\\n          the Court that there are reasonable grounds for\\n          believing that the accused is “not guilty” of such offence\\n          and the satisfaction to be recorded for the purposes of\\n          the 1967 Act that there are reasonable grounds for\\n          believing that the accusation against such person is\\n          “prima facie” true. By its very nature, the expression\\n          “prima      facie true”   would       mean     that    the\\n          materials/evidence collated by the investigating agency\\n          in reference to the accusation against the accused\\n          concerned in the first information report, must prevail\\n          until contradicted and overcome or disproved by other\\n          evidence, and on the face of it, shows the complicity of\\n          such accused in the commission of the stated offence. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"244079\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">It\\n          must be good and sufficient on its face to establish a\\n          given fact or the chain of facts constituting the stated\\n          offence, unless rebutted or contradicted. In one sense,\\n          the degree of satisfaction is lighter when the Court has\\n          to opine that the accusation is “prima facie true”, as\\n          compared to the opinion of the accused “not guilty” of\\n          such offence as required under the other special\\n          enactments. In any case, the degree of satisfaction to\\n          be recorded by the Court for opining that there are\\n          reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation\\n          against the accused is prima facie true, is lighter than\\n          the degree of satisfaction to be recorded for considering\\n          a discharge application or framing of charges in relation\\n          to offences under the 1967 Act. Nevertheless, we may\\n          take guidance from the exposition in <a href=\\\"/doc/244079/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Ranjitsing\\n          Brahmajeetsing Sharma v.

Does this statute require that before a\\n    person is released on bail, the court, albeit\\n    prima facie, must come to the conclusion that\\n    he is not guilty of such offence? Is it necessary\\n    for the court to record such a finding? Would\\n    there be any machinery available to the court\\n    to ascertain that once the accused is enlarged\\n    on bail, he would not commit any offence\\n    whatsoever?\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_15\\\">    37. Such findings are required to be recorded\\n    only for the purpose of arriving at an objective\\n    finding on the basis of materials on record\\n    only for grant of bail and for no other purpose.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_16\\\">    38. We are furthermore of the opinion that the\\n    restrictions on the power of the court to grant\\n    bail should not be pushed too far. If the court,\\n    having regard to the materials brought on\\n    record, is satisfied that in all probability he\\n    may not be ultimately convicted, an order\\n    granting bail may be passed. The satisfaction\\n    of the court as regards his likelihood of not\\n    committing an offence while on bail must be\\n    construed to mean an offence under the Act\\n    and not any offence whatsoever be it a minor\\n    or major offence. … What would further be\\n    necessary on the part of the court is to see the\\n    culpability of the accused and his involvement\\n    in the commission of an organised crime either\\n    directly or indirectly. The court at the time of\\n    considering the application for grant of bail\\n    shall consider the question from the angle as\\n    to whether he was possessed of the requisite\\n    mens rea.”\\nAnd again in paras 44 to 48, the Court observed : (SCC\\npp. 318-20)\\n    “44. The wording of <a href=\\\"/doc/945595/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">Section 21(4)</a>, in our\\n    opinion, does not lead to the conclusion that\\n    the court must arrive at a positive finding that\\n    the applicant for bail has not committed an\\n    offence under the Act. If such a construction is\\n    placed, the court intending to grant bail must\\n    arrive at a finding that the applicant has not\\n    committed such an offence. In such an event, it\\n    will be impossible for the prosecution to obtain\\n\\n                                                      12 | P a g e\\n\\fa judgment of conviction of the applicant. Such\\ncannot be the intention of the legislature.\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/945595/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">Section 21(4)</a> of MCOCA, therefore, must be\\nconstrued reasonably. It must be so construed\\nthat the court is able to maintain a delicate\\nbalance between a judgment of acquittal and\\nconviction and an order granting bail much\\nbefore commencement of trial. Similarly, the\\ncourt will be required to record a finding as to\\nthe possibility of his committing a crime after\\ngrant of bail. However, such an offence in\\nfuturo must be an offence under the Act and\\nnot any other offence. Since it is difficult to\\npredict the future conduct of an accused, the\\ncourt must necessarily consider this aspect of\\nthe matter having regard to the antecedents of\\nthe accused, his propensities and the nature\\nand manner in which he is alleged to have\\ncommitted the offence.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_17\\\">45. It is, furthermore, trite that for the purpose\\nof considering an application for grant of bail,\\nalthough detailed reasons are not necessary to\\nbe assigned, the order granting bail must\\ndemonstrate application of mind at least in\\nserious cases as to why the applicant has\\nbeen granted or denied the privilege of bail.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_18\\\">46. The duty of the court at this stage is not to\\nweigh the evidence meticulously but to arrive\\nat a finding on the basis of broad probabilities.\\nHowever, while dealing with a special statute\\nlike MCOCA having regard to the provisions\\ncontained in sub-section (4) of <a href=\\\"/doc/945595/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Section 21</a> of the\\nAct, the court may have to probe into the\\nmatter deeper so as to enable it to arrive at a\\nfinding that the materials collected against the\\naccused during the investigation may not\\njustify a judgment of conviction. The findings\\nrecorded by the court while granting or\\nrefusing bail undoubtedly would be tentative\\nin nature, which may not have any bearing on\\nthe merit of the case and the trial court would,\\nthus, be free to decide the case on the basis of\\nevidence adduced at the trial, without in any\\nmanner being prejudiced thereby.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\">47. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1342616\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/1342616/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v.

Therefore, we are not in\\nagreement with the argument addressed\\nby the learned counsel for the accused that\\nthe High Court was not expected even to\\nindicate a prima facie finding on all points\\nurged before it while granting bail, more so\\nin the background of the facts of this case\\nwhere on facts it is established that a large\\nnumber of witnesses who were examined\\nafter the respondent was enlarged on bail\\nhad turned hostile and there are\\ncomplaints made to the court as to the\\nthreats administered by the respondent or\\nhis supporters to witnesses in the case.

The\\n             other ground apart from the ground of\\n             incarceration which appealed to the High\\n             Court to grant bail was the fact that a large\\n             number of witnesses are yet to be\\n             examined and there is no likelihood of the\\n             trial coming to an end in the near future.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_23\\\">             As stated hereinabove, this ground on the\\n             facts of this case is also not sufficient\\n             either individually or coupled with the\\n             period of incarceration to release the\\n             respondent on bail because of the serious\\n             allegations   of    tampering     with    the\\n             witnesses made against the respondent.’\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_24\\\">             48.      <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1579661\\\" id=\\\"span_10\\\">In      <a href=\\\"/doc/1579661/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">Jayendra        Saraswathi\\n             Swamigal v.

The High Court, however, did not take into\\n\\nconsideration, the factor of the appellants’ continued detention.\\n\\nBut the judgment of the High Court was delivered on 15 th\\n\\nOctober 2019, when the appellants were in detention for a\\n\\nperiod little over one year.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_87\\\">17.

The other set of\\n\\ndocuments     on which     the NIA       has      placed     reliance,   are\\n\\nliteratures, pamphlets etc. some of which are meant to have\\n\\nbeen   recovered    from       the   residences    of    the    appellants\\n                                                                   29 | P a g e\\n\\fthemselves. So far as the aforesaid letters are concerned, copies\\n\\nthereof have been annexed to the courter-affidavits of the NIA\\n\\nfiled in connection with both the appeals.     We shall refer to\\n\\nthem in this judgment in the way they have been described\\n\\nnumerically as annexures in NIA’s counter-affidavit in the\\n\\nappeal of AF. The first document is an undated letter addressed\\n\\nto Surendra, from an unnamed sender, marked as Annexure “R-\\n\\n6”. This letter is claimed to have been recovered from the\\n\\ncomputer of one of the co-accused and refers to Radical Student\\n\\nUnion initiative by AF and VG. This letter requests the\\n\\naddressee to ask Arun to manage finances for legal defence of\\n\\none Murgan. There is further reference to two other individuals\\n\\nwho apparently have been inspired by the struggles of AF and\\n\\nVG.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_88\\\">18. The second document is a letter dated 18 th April 2017,\\n\\nmarked as Annexure “R-10”, addressed to one “Comrade\\n\\nPrakash” and is claimed to have been written by “R”.\\n\\nProsecution claims “R” is Rona Wilson. Only reference to the\\n\\ntwo appellants in this document is that they, and others were\\n\\nequally concerned about the “two-line struggle” that was slowly\\n\\ntaking shape on the urban front. The source of this letter has\\n\\nnot been disclosed in the counter-affidavit. From the content of\\n                                                        30 | P a g e\\n\\fthis letter, the Agency wants to establish that the appellants\\n\\nwere senior leaders of the banned organisation.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_89\\\">19.      The third document is a letter dated 25th September\\n\\n2017, marked as Annexure “R-12”, written by “Comrade\\n\\nPrakash”, which is claimed to have been recovered from the\\n\\ncomputer of Surendra Gadling and addressee thereof is\\n\\n“Comrade Surendra”.        Here also there is appreciation of\\n\\nactivities of ‘Vernon’ and ‘Arun’ in motivating research scholars\\n\\nto get them involved in the revolutionary movement. About VG,\\n\\nit is recorded that one “Comrade G” has been asked to arrange\\n\\nAPT to meet with Vernon.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_90\\\">20. As regards AF, his name appears in an undated letter,\\n\\nmarked as Annexure “R-4”, addressed to Surendra by Darsu,\\n\\nwhich refers to organisation of a joint meeting by the addressee\\n\\nand Arun in Hyderabad. The next letter is purported to have\\n\\nbeen written to Prakash by Surendra on 5 th November 2017 and\\n\\nis marked as Annexure “R-5”. It refers to establishing Indian\\n\\nAssociation of People’s Lawyer (“IAPL”) in Kerala for which\\n\\ndiscussion was held with Arun. According to the Agency, IAPL –\\n\\na lawyer’s body is a frontal organisation of the banned\\n\\norganisation. This communication records a proposed visit to\\n\\nKerala on International Human Rights Day by AF and the\\n                                                        31 | P a g e\\n\\fauthor thereof. This is followed by a further communication\\n\\nfrom Prakash to Surendra dated 16th July 2017 (“R-7”). This\\n\\nletter records a proposed visit of Arun to Chennai in connection\\n\\nwith release of a detained party member as also raising of funds\\n\\nfor the legal defence of detained persons. Here also, there is\\n\\nappreciation of AF and VG’s work. The next letter at Annexure\\n\\n“R-22” is claimed to have been written by Sudha Bharadwaj to\\n\\nPrakash and this letter relates to a seminar titled “Udta\\n\\nLoktantra against the <a href=\\\"/doc/1389751/\\\" id=\\\"a_63\\\">UAPA Act</a>” in which Arun was to\\n\\nparticipate. Lastly there is a letter at Annexure “R-14” written\\n\\nby one Anantwa to Comrade Monibai which relates to the\\n\\ncelebration of 50th    Anniversary     of the Great Proletarian\\n\\nrevolution and Naxalites organisation in Mumbai (Bombay) and\\n\\nrecords that the party had sent revolutionary greetings to\\n\\nComrades of various associations, including the appellant,\\n\\nArun.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_91\\\">21. There is also a reference to an account statement alleged\\n\\nby the prosecution to have been recovered from the laptop of\\n\\nRona Wilson (Annexure “R-3”).          We reproduce below this\\n\\nstatement in the same form as it has been represented in the\\n\\nsaid Annexure:-\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_24\\\">        “Surendra=R=2.5L from Milind\\n                                                        32 | P a g e\\n\\f         Shoma &amp; amp; Sudhir = R and D = 1L from Surendra\\n         Amit B = R = 1.5 for CPDR canvasing\\n         And T = R = 90T from Surendra (Through Milind)\\n         Myself = R = 1.8L from Com Manoj\\n         Arun = R = 2L from Com Darsu\\n         VV = R = 5L from Com G.”\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_92\\\">22. Apart      from   these   letters   and   statements,   various\\n\\nliteratures, books etc. have been referred to by the prosecution\\n\\nwhich they claim to have recovered from the residences of AF\\n\\nand VG.     These mainly involve writings on extreme left-wing\\n\\nideology including its application to India. Similar materials are\\n\\nalleged to have been recovered from other accused persons as\\n\\nwell.   Recovery of different electronic communication devices\\n\\nlike Mobile Phones, Tablets, Pen Drives and ancillary items is\\n\\nalleged to have been made.       From these devices themselves,\\n\\nhowever, no evidence has been cited before us which would\\n\\nimplicate AF and VG in terrorist acts and the other offences\\n\\nbarring the letters on which emphasis has been laid by the\\n\\nagency. We have already referred to the letters which the law\\n\\nenforcement agency alleges to have recovered from the devices\\n\\nof other accused persons in which there are references to AF\\n\\nand VG. Call Detail Records have also been referred to for\\n\\nestablishing location of the accused and also their inter-\\n\\nassociation.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_93\\\">                                                            33 | P a g e\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_94\\\">\\f23. In pursuance of the judgment of this Court in the case of\\n\\nZahoor Ahmad Shah Watali (supra) the documents relied upon\\n\\nby the prosecution at this stage ought to prevail until overcome\\n\\nor disproved by other evidences. In the case of Dr. Anand\\n\\nTeltumbde -vs- National Investigation Agency and Another\\n\\n[2022 SCC OnLine Bom 5174] allegations were similar in nature\\n\\nagainst the petitioner therein. He was charged with all the\\n\\nSections of the 1967 Act as has been done in the cases of AF\\n\\nand VG except <a href=\\\"/doc/9569781/\\\" id=\\\"a_64\\\">Section 40</a>.       The Bombay High Court by a\\n\\njudgment delivered on 18th November 2022 had enlarged him on\\n\\nbail. The NIA’s petition for special leave to appeal [SLP(Crl) No.\\n\\n11345/2022] against that judgment was dismissed by a\\n\\nCoordinate Bench of this Court on 25th November 2022.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_95\\\">24. As it would be evident from the analysis of the evidence\\n\\ncited by the NIA, the acts allegedly committed by the appellants\\n\\ncan be categorised under three heads.          The first is their\\n\\nassociation with a terrorist organisation which the prosecution\\n\\nclaims from the letters and witness statements, particulars of\\n\\nwhich we have given above. But what we must be conscious of,\\n\\nwhile dealing with prima facie worth of these statements and\\n\\ndocuments is that none of them had been seized or recovered\\n\\nfrom the appellants but these recoveries are alleged to have been\\n                                                         34 | P a g e\\n\\fmade from the co-accused. The second head of alleged offensive\\n\\nacts of the appellants is keeping literatures propagating violence\\n\\nand   promoting    overthrowing   of   a   democratically     elected\\n\\ngovernment through armed struggle. But again, it is not the\\n\\nNIA’s case that either of the two appellants is the author of the\\n\\nmaterials found from their residences, as alleged. None of these\\n\\nliteratures has been specifically proscribed so as to constitute an\\n\\noffence, just by keeping them. Thirdly, so far as AF is concerned,\\n\\nsome materials point to handling of finances.           But such\\n\\nfinances, as per the materials through which the dealings are\\n\\nsought to be established, show that the transaction was mainly\\n\\nfor the purpose of litigation on behalf of, it appears to us,\\n\\ndetained party persons. The formation of or association with a\\n\\nlegal front of the banned terrorist organisation has also been\\n\\nattributed to AF, in addition. The High Court while analysing\\n\\neach of these documents individually did not opine that there\\n\\nwere reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations\\n\\nagainst such persons were not prima facie true. Those offences\\n\\nwhich come within Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act, charged\\n\\nagainst the appellants, are <a href=\\\"/doc/122170/\\\" id=\\\"a_65\\\">Sections 16</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/1781202/\\\" id=\\\"a_66\\\">17</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/354849/\\\" id=\\\"a_67\\\">18</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/49549938/\\\" id=\\\"a_68\\\">18B</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/1561699/\\\" id=\\\"a_69\\\">20</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/193606593/\\\" id=\\\"a_70\\\">38</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/100239829/\\\" id=\\\"a_71\\\">39</a>\\n\\nand <a href=\\\"/doc/9569781/\\\" id=\\\"a_72\\\">40</a>. We have summarised the nature of allegations reflected\\n\\nin the chargesheet as also the affidavit of the NIA. Now we shall\\n                                                            35 | P a g e\\n\\fhave to ascertain if on the basis of these materials, the\\n\\nprosecution has made out reasonable grounds to persuade the\\n\\nCourt to be satisfied that the accusations against the appellants\\n\\nare prima facie true. There is charge under <a href=\\\"/doc/1214158/\\\" id=\\\"a_73\\\">Section 13</a> of the\\n\\n1967 Act and certain offences under the 1860 Code against the\\n\\nappellants also. But we shall first deal with the appellants’ case\\n\\nin relation to charges made against them under the aforesaid\\n\\nprovisions.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_96\\\">25. <a href=\\\"/doc/122170/\\\" id=\\\"a_74\\\">Section 16</a> prescribes punishment for committing terrorist\\n\\nact and terrorist act has been defined in <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_75\\\">Section 15</a> of the 1967\\n\\nstatute.   We have reproduced these provisions earlier in this\\n\\njudgment.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_97\\\">26. In none of the materials which have been referred to by the\\n\\nprosecution, the acts specified to in sub-clause (a) of <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_76\\\">Section\\n\\n15(1)</a> of the 1967 Act can be attributed to the appellants. Nor\\n\\nthere is any allegation against them which would attract sub-\\n\\nclause (c) of <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_77\\\">Section 15(1)</a> of the said statute. As regards the\\n\\nacts specified in <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_78\\\">Section 15(1) (b)</a> thereof, some of the literature\\n\\nalleged to have been recovered from the appellants, by\\n\\nthemselves give hint of propagation of such activities. But there\\n\\nis nothing against the appellants to prima facie establish that\\n\\n\\n                                                          36 | P a g e\\n\\fthey had indulged in the activities which would constitute\\n\\noverawing any public functionary by means of criminal force or\\n\\nthe show of criminal force or attempts by the appellants to do\\n\\nso. Neither there is allegation against them of causing death of\\n\\nany public functionary or attempt to cause death of such\\n\\nfunctionary. Mere holding of certain literatures through which\\n\\nviolent acts may be propagated would not ipso facto attract the\\n\\nprovisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_79\\\">Section 15(1)(b)</a> of the said Act. Thus, prima facie,\\n\\nin our opinion, we cannot reasonably come to a finding that any\\n\\ncase against the appellants under <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_80\\\">Section 15(1) (b)</a> of 1967 Act\\n\\ncan be held to be true.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_98\\\">27. <a href=\\\"/doc/1781202/\\\" id=\\\"a_81\\\">Section 17</a> of the 1967 Act deals with punishment for\\n\\nraising funds for terrorist acts.     Here also the funds, dealing\\n\\nwith which has been attributed to AF, cannot be connected to\\n\\nany terrorist act. In the case of Dr. Anand Teltumbde (supra)\\n\\nthe same account statement was referred to. In respect of such\\n\\nallegations against Dr. Anand Teltumbde the Bombay High\\n\\nCourt came to the following finding:-\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_25\\\">          “42. Mr. Patil has vehemently argued that this\\n          statement from the earlier letter supports receipt of\\n          monies i.e. Rs. 90,000/- by Anand T. (Appellant) from\\n          Surendra (accused No. 3) who was authorized to\\n          provide funds for future programmes. On careful\\n          reading of the earlier letter dated 02.01.2018 and the\\n          aforementioned statement of account it is seen that\\n          there is a fallacy in the argument of NIA. Assuming\\n                                                                   37 | P a g e\\n\\f         that Anand T. is the Appellant himself and he received\\n         Rs. 90,000/- from Surendra through Milind, firstly it\\n         cannot be linked to the statement in the earlier letter\\n         dated 02.01.2018 since this account statement\\n         pertains to the year 2016 and or 2017. The document\\n         has a heading; viz; Party fund received in last year\\n         from C.C. Last year would invariably mean the\\n         account of 2016 as the title of this document is\\n         “Accounts2K17” which would mean Accounts for\\n         2017”. That apart requiring us to presume that Anand\\n         T. is the Appellant would require further corroboration\\n         and evidence. prima facie it appears that, the same\\n         has not been brought on record. This document is\\n         unsigned and has been recovered from the\\n         laptop one of the co-accused. Hence, at\\n         this prima facie stage we cannot presume that\\n         Anand T. i.e. the Appellant received Rs. 90,000/-\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_99\\\">         from Surendra Gadling as argued by NIA.

Here we must point out that there is also a request made\\n\\nto Surendra from an unnamed person to ask AF to manage the\\n\\nfinancial expenses of “these cases”. The name of another Arun,\\n\\nwith the surname Bhelke has surfaced in Annexure “R-19” to\\n\\nthe NIA’s counter-affidavit in AF’s case. This is a copy of a\\n\\nwitness statement. In absence of any form of corroboration at\\n\\nthe prima facie stage it cannot be presumed that it was the\\n\\nsame Arun (i.e., AF) who had received money from Darsu. The\\n\\nprosecution has also not produced any material to show that\\n\\nactual money was transmitted. The communication dated 5 th\\n\\nNovember 2017 (“R-5”), purportedly addressed by Surendra to\\n\\nPrakash does not speak of any payment being made to AF. The\\n\\n                                                                   38 | P a g e\\n\\frationale applied by the Bombay High Court in the above-\\n\\nquoted passage of the judgment in the case of Dr. Anand\\n\\nTeltumbde (supra), which has been sustained by this Court,\\n\\nought to apply in the case of AF as well.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_101\\\">29. We have already observed that it is not possible for us to\\n\\nform an opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing\\n\\nthat the accusation against the appellant of committing or\\n\\nconspiring to commit terrorist act is prima facie true. The\\n\\nwitness statements do not refer to any terrorist act alleged to\\n\\nhave been committed by the appellants. The copies of the letters\\n\\nin which the appellants or any one of them have been referred,\\n\\nrecord only third-party response or reaction of the appellants’\\n\\nactivities   contained   in   communications     among    different\\n\\nindividuals. These have not been recovered from the appellants.\\n\\nHence, these communications or content thereof have weak\\n\\nprobative value or quality. That being the position, neither the\\n\\nprovisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/354849/\\\" id=\\\"a_82\\\">Section 18</a> nor 18B can be invoked against the\\n\\nappellants, prima facie, at this stage.     The association of the\\n\\nappellants with the activities of the designated terrorist\\n\\norganisation is sought to be established through third party\\n\\ncommunications. Moreover, actual involvement of the appellants\\n\\nin any terrorist act has not surfaced from any of these\\n                                                          39 | P a g e\\n\\fcommunications. Nor there is any credible case of conspiracy to\\n\\ncommit offences enumerated under chapters IV and VI of the\\n\\n1967 Act.

So far as application of <a href=\\\"/doc/1561699/\\\" id=\\\"a_83\\\">Section 20</a> of the 1967 Act is\\n\\nconcerned, the Bombay High Court in the case of Dr. Anand\\n\\nTeltumbde (supra) construed the said provision in the following\\n\\nmanner:-\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_26\\\">            “52. <a href=\\\"/doc/1561699/\\\" id=\\\"a_84\\\">Section 20</a> cannot be interpreted to mean that\\n            merely being a member of a terrorist gang would\\n            entail such a member for the above punishment.\\n            What is important is the terrorist act and what is\\n            required for the Court to see is the material before\\n            the Court to show that such a person has been\\n            involved in or has indulged in a terrorist act.\\n            Terrorist act is very widely defined under Section\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_27\\\">            15. In the present case, seizure of the incriminating\\n            material as alluded to hereinabove does not in any\\n            manner prima facie leads to draw an inferance\\n            that, Appellant has committed or indulged in a\\n            ‘terrorist act’ as contemplated under <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_85\\\">Section 15</a> of\\n            the UAP Act.”\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_103\\\">31.

Moreover, no material has been\\n\\ndemonstrated by the NIA before us that the appellants are\\n\\nmembers of the terrorist organisation. AF’s involvement with\\n                                                                    40 | P a g e\\n\\fIAPL as a frontal organisation of the Communist Party of India\\n\\n(Maoist) is sought to be established, and that has been referred\\n\\nto in the chargesheet as well. But the link between IAPL and the\\n\\nCPI (Maoist) has not been clearly demonstrated through any\\n\\nmaterial. Reference to AF and VG as members of the CPI (Maoist)\\n\\nappears from the statement of protected witness, but that link is\\n\\nmade in relation to events between the years 2002-2007, before\\n\\nthe organisation was included in the First Schedule to the 1967\\n\\nAct. No evidence of continued membership after the party was\\n\\nclassified as a terrorist organisation has been brought to our\\n\\nnotice. Nor is there any reliable evidence to link IAPL with CPI\\n\\n(Maoist) as its frontal organisation. We have already dealt with\\n\\nthe position of the appellants vis-à-vis terrorist acts in earlier\\n\\nparagraphs of this judgment and we prima facie do not think\\n\\nthat <a href=\\\"/doc/1561699/\\\" id=\\\"a_87\\\">Section 20</a> can be made applicable against the appellants at\\n\\nthis stage of the proceeding, on the basis of available materials.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_104\\\">32. “Terrorist act” as defined under <a href=\\\"/doc/848897/\\\" id=\\\"a_88\\\">Section 2(k)</a> of the 1967 Act\\n\\ncarries the meaning assigned to it in <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_89\\\">Section 15</a>. This Section\\n\\nalso stipulates that the expressions “terrorism” and “terrorist”\\n\\nshall be construed accordingly.

But so far as the word “terrorist” is\\n\\nconcerned, in this Section also, the interpretation thereof would\\n\\nbe relatable to the same expression as used in <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_92\\\">Section 15</a>. It is\\n\\none of the basic rules of statutory construction that an\\n\\nexpression used in different parts of a statute shall ordinarily\\n\\nconvey the same meaning – unless contrary intention appears\\n\\nfrom different parts of the same enactment itself. We do not find\\n\\nany such contrary intention in the 1967 Act.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_106\\\">33. <a href=\\\"/doc/193606593/\\\" id=\\\"a_93\\\">Section 38</a> of the 1967 Act carries the heading or title\\n\\n“offence relating to membership of a terrorist organisation”.\\n\\nAs we have already observed, a terrorist act would have to be\\n\\nconstrued having regard to the meaning assigned to it in <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_94\\\">Section\\n\\n15</a> thereof. We have given our interpretation to this provision\\n\\nearlier. “terrorist organisation” [as employed in <a href=\\\"/doc/848897/\\\" id=\\\"a_95\\\">Section 2(m)</a>], in\\n\\nour opinion is not a mere nomenclature and this expression\\n\\nwould mean an organisation that carries on or indulges in\\n\\n                                                         42 | P a g e\\n\\fterrorist acts, as defined in said <a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_96\\\">Section 15</a>. The term terrorism,\\n\\nin view of the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/848897/\\\" id=\\\"a_97\\\">Section 2(k)</a> of the said Act, ought to\\n\\nbe interpreted in tandem with what is meant by ‘terrorist Act’ in\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/503626/\\\" id=\\\"a_98\\\">Section 15</a> thereof.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_107\\\">34. In this context, to bring the appellants within the fold of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/193606593/\\\" id=\\\"a_99\\\">Section 38</a> of the 1967 Act, the prosecution ought to have prima\\n\\nfacie establish their association with intention to further the\\n\\nsaid organisation’s terrorist activities. It is only when such\\n\\nintention to further the terrorist activities is established prima\\n\\nfacie, appellants could be brought within the fold of the offence\\n\\nrelating to membership of a terrorist organisation. To bring\\n\\nwithin the scope of <a href=\\\"/doc/193606593/\\\" id=\\\"a_100\\\">Section 38</a> of the 1967 Act, it would not be\\n\\nsufficient to demonstrate that one is an associate or someone\\n\\nwho professes to be associated with a terrorist organisation. But\\n\\nthere must be intention to further the activities of such\\n\\norganisation on the part of the person implicated under such\\n\\nprovision. But the same line of reasoning in respect of\\n\\nmembership of a terrorist organisation under <a href=\\\"/doc/1561699/\\\" id=\\\"a_101\\\">Section 20</a>, ought\\n\\nto apply in respect of an alleged offender implicated in <a href=\\\"/doc/193606593/\\\" id=\\\"a_102\\\">Section 38</a>\\n\\nof the 1967 Act. There must be evidence of there being intention\\n\\nto be involved in a terrorist act. So far as the appellants are\\n\\n\\n                                                          43 | P a g e\\n\\fconcerned, at this stage there is no such evidence before us on\\n\\nwhich we can rely.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_108\\\">35. In three decisions of this Court, Hitendra Vishnu Thakur\\n\\nand Others -vs- State of Maharashtra and Others [(1994) 4\\n\\nSCC 602],   Niranjan Singh Karam Singh Punjabi, Advocate\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_109\\\">-vs- Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya and Others [(1990) 4 SCC 76]\\n\\nand Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon and Others -vs- State of\\n\\nGujarat [(1988) 2 SCC 271], the manner in which stringent\\n\\nprovisions of a statute ought to be interpreted has been laid\\n\\ndown. In all the three authorities, observation of this Court has\\n\\nbeen that the Court ought to carefully examine every case,\\n\\nbefore making an assessment if the Act would apply or not.\\n\\nWhen the statutes have stringent provisions the duty of the\\n\\nCourt would be more onerous. Graver the offence, greater should\\n\\nbe the care taken to see that the offence would fall within the\\n\\nfour corners of the Act. Though these judgments were delivered\\n\\nwhile testing similar rigorous provisions under the <a href=\\\"/doc/17848451/\\\" id=\\\"a_103\\\">Terrorist and\\n\\nDisruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987</a>, the same principle\\n\\nwould apply in respect of the 1967 Act as well.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_110\\\">36. In the case of Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali (supra), it has\\n\\nbeen held that the expression “prima facie true” would mean\\n\\n                                                        44 | P a g e\\n\\fthat the materials/evidence collated by the investigating agency\\n\\nin reference to the accusation against the accused concerned in\\n\\nthe chargesheet must prevail, unless overcome or disproved by\\n\\nother evidence, and on the face of it, materials must show\\n\\ncomplicity of such accused in the commission of the stated\\n\\noffences. What this ratio contemplates is that on the face of it,\\n\\nthe accusation against the accused ought to prevail. In our\\n\\nopinion, however, it would not satisfy the prima facie “test”\\n\\nunless there is at least surface-analysis of probative value of the\\n\\nevidence, at the stage of examining the question of granting bail\\n\\nand the quality or probative value satisfies the Court of its\\n\\nworth.   In the case of the appellants, contents of the letters\\n\\nthrough which the appellants are sought to be implicated are in\\n\\nthe nature of hearsay evidence, recovered from co-accused.\\n\\nMoreover, no covert or overt terrorist act has been attributed to\\n\\nthe appellants in these letters, or any other material forming\\n\\npart of records of these two appeals. Reference to the activities of\\n\\nthe accused are in the nature of ideological propagation and\\n\\nallegations of recruitment.   No evidence of any of the persons\\n\\nwho are alleged to have been recruited or have joined this\\n\\n“struggle” inspired by the appellants has been brought before us.\\n\\nThus, we are unable to accept NIA’s contention that the\\n                                                          45 | P a g e\\n\\fappellants have committed the offence relating to support given\\n\\nto a terrorist organisation.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_111\\\">37. The second set of materials include the witness statements.\\n\\nThere also no covert or overt act of terrorism has been attributed\\n\\nto the appellants by the three witnesses. We have dealt with the\\n\\nsummary of their statements earlier in this judgment. We have\\n\\nalso observed earlier that mere possession of the literature, even\\n\\nif the content thereof inspires or propagates violence, by itself\\n\\ncannot constitute any of the offences within Chapters IV and VI\\n\\nof the 1967 Act.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_112\\\">38. We have already analysed <a href=\\\"/doc/193606593/\\\" id=\\\"a_104\\\">Sections 38</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/100239829/\\\" id=\\\"a_105\\\">39</a> of the 1967\\n\\nAct. The interpretation given by us to the phrase “intention to\\n\\nfurther activities” of terrorist organisation could also apply in\\n\\nthe same way in relation to <a href=\\\"/doc/100239829/\\\" id=\\\"a_106\\\">Section 39</a> of the same statute.\\n\\nThere has been no credible evidence against the appellants of\\n\\ncommission of any terrorist act or enter into conspiracy to do so\\n\\nto invoke the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/165949346/\\\" id=\\\"a_107\\\">Section 43D (5)</a> of the 1967 Act.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_113\\\">39. As far as raising funds for a terrorist organisation is\\n\\nconcerned, we do not think at this stage, in absence of better\\n\\nevidence, the account statement is credible enough to justify\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                         46 | P a g e\\n\\finvoking the bail-restricting clause by attracting <a href=\\\"/doc/9569781/\\\" id=\\\"a_108\\\">Section 40</a> of\\n\\nthe 1967 Act.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_114\\\">40. We are returning these findings as the restrictions on the\\n\\nCourt while examining the question of bail under the 1967 Act is\\n\\nless stringent in comparison to the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/496325/\\\" id=\\\"a_109\\\">Section 37</a> of\\n\\nthe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. We\\n\\nare not called upon, for granting a bail to an accused with\\n\\ncommercial quantity of contraband article under the 1985 Act,\\n\\nto satisfy ourselves that there are reasonable grounds for\\n\\nbelieving that an accused is not guilty of such offence and that\\n\\nhe is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Here, we\\n\\nhave to satisfy ourselves that the specified offences alleged to\\n\\nhave been committed by the appellants cannot be held to be\\n\\nprima facie true.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_115\\\">41. We shall now turn to the other offence under the 1967 Act,\\n\\nwhich is under <a href=\\\"/doc/1214158/\\\" id=\\\"a_110\\\">Section 13</a> thereof, and the 1860 Code offences.\\n\\nThe yardstick for justifying the appellants’ plea for bail is lighter\\n\\nin this context. The appellants are almost five years in detention.\\n\\nIn the cases of K.A. Najeeb (supra) and Angela Harish\\n\\nSontakke (supra), delay of trial was considered to be a relevant\\n\\nfactor while examining the plea for bail of the accused. In the\\n\\n                                                           47 | P a g e\\n\\fcase of K.A. Najeeb (supra), in particular, this same provision,\\n\\nthat is <a href=\\\"/doc/165949346/\\\" id=\\\"a_111\\\">Section 43D (5)</a> was involved.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_116\\\">42. In these two proceedings, the appellants have not crossed,\\n\\nas undertrials, a substantial term of the sentence that may have\\n\\nbeen ultimately imposed against them if the prosecution could\\n\\nestablish the charges against them.        But the fundamental\\n\\nproposition of law laid down in K.A. Najeeb (supra), that a bail-\\n\\nrestricting   clause   cannot   denude   the   jurisdiction   of   a\\n\\nConstitutional Court in testing if continued detention in a given\\n\\ncase would breach the concept of liberty enshrined in <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_112\\\">Article 21</a>\\n\\nof the Constitution of India, would apply in a case where such a\\n\\nbail-restricting clause is being invoked on the basis of materials\\n\\nwith prima facie low-probative value or quality.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_117\\\">43. In the case of Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali (supra)\\n\\nreference was made to the judgment of Jayendra Saraswathi\\n\\nSwamigal -vs-     State of Tamil Nadu [(2005) 2 SCC 13) in\\n\\nwhich, citing two earlier decisions of this court in the cases of\\n\\nState -vs- Jagjit Singh (AIR 1962 SC 253)          and Gurcharan\\n\\nSingh -vs- State       of (UT of Delhi) [(1978) 1 SCC 118), the\\n\\nfactors for granting bail under normal circumstances were\\n\\ndiscussed. It was held that the nature and seriousness of the\\n\\n                                                         48 | P a g e\\n\\foffences, the character of the evidence, circumstances which are\\n\\npeculiar to the accused, a reasonable possibility of the presence\\n\\nof the accused not being secured at the trial; reasonable\\n\\napprehension of witnesses being tempered with; the larger\\n\\ninterest of the public or the State would be relevant factors for\\n\\ngranting or rejecting bail.   Juxtaposing the appellants’ case\\n\\nfounded on <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_113\\\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_114\\\">21</a> of the Constitution of India with\\n\\nthe aforesaid allegations and considering the fact that almost\\n\\nfive years have lapsed since they were taken into custody, we are\\n\\nsatisfied that the appellants have made out a case for granting\\n\\nbail. Allegations against them no doubt are serious, but for that\\n\\nreason alone bail cannot be denied to them. While dealing with\\n\\nthe offences under Chapters IV and VI of the 1967 Act, we have\\n\\nreferred to the materials available against them at this stage.\\n\\nThese materials cannot justify continued detention of the\\n\\nappellants, pending final outcome of the case under the others\\n\\nprovisions of the 1860 Code and the 1967 Act.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_118\\\">44. While forming our opinion over granting bail to the\\n\\nappellants, we have taken into account the fact that that VG was\\n\\nonce earlier convicted involving offences, inter-alia, under 1967\\n\\nAct and there is also a pending criminal case against him on the\\n\\n\\n                                                        49 | P a g e\\n\\fallegations of similar line of activities. Hence, we propose to\\n\\nimpose appropriate conditions in respect of both, which they\\n\\nshall have to comply with, while on bail.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_119\\\">45. We accordingly set aside the impugned judgments and\\n\\ndirect that the appellants be released on bail in respect of the\\n\\ncases(s) out of which the present appeals arise, on such terms\\n\\nand conditions the Special Court may consider fit and proper, if\\n\\nthe appellants or any one of them are not wanted in respect of\\n\\nany other case.
