After\\n\\nlooking into the matter further, Appellant No. 2\\n\\nlearned that the said sale deed was registered in the\\n\\noffice of Sub­Registrar Kadipur, District Gurugram\\n\\nand was executed by Respondent No. 2. The\\n\\nexecution in question was based on yet another,\\n\\npurportedly,          forged and fabricated GPA bearing\\n\\nVasika No. 13907 dated 18.09.1996 (hereinafter,\\n\\n‘1996       GPA’),           registered        in     the   office    of\\n\\nSub­Registrar­V, South East Delhi.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">5.

Upon examining the 2022 Sale Deed, it\\n\\nwas apparent to them that the accused had failed to\\n\\nprovide a PAN Number, which is mandatorily\\n\\nrequired for a valid sale deed. Furthermore, there\\n\\nwas no mention of the 1% amount of Tax Deducted\\n\\nat Source (hereinafter, ‘TDS’) being deposited, which\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_11\\\">Crl.

The complaint also mentioned the current\\n\\nmarket value of the Appellants&#x27; land, measuring 15\\n\\nKanal 2 Marla, as being approximately                            not less\\n\\nthan Rs. 50 crores. However, in the 2022 Sale Deed,\\n\\nthe sale consideration was shown as an abjectly low\\n\\nand meager amount of Rs. 6,60,62,500/­, which\\n\\nwas significantly below its actual asking price.\\n\\nMoreover, the Appellants had not received even this\\n\\nminiscule amount even if the 2022 Sale Deed was\\n\\nhypothetically considered to be valid. Thus, this\\n\\ndocument was clearly created by Respondent No. 2\\n\\nand the co­accused in collusion with the witnesses,\\n\\nthe scribe, and officials of the Sub­Registrar Tehsil\\n\\nKadipur,        District      Gurugram,           with     the      unholy\\n\\nintention to wisk the property away from the                             the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_12\\\">Crl.

No indication regarding the\\n\\nlocation of the original document has been placed\\n\\nbefore us. In light of Respondent No. 2’s own\\n\\ncontention, what transpired in 1996 was the sale of\\n\\nthe Subject Land through the GPA. Upon reviewing\\n\\na copy of the alleged 1996 GPA presented to the\\n\\ncourt, the Appellants relinquished all crucial rights\\n\\npertaining to the Subject Land. These rights include\\n\\npossession of the land, handling water, sewer,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_30\\\">Crl. A. No.___ of 2023 @ SLP (CRL.) D.

The ownership of the land\\n\\nalways remained in the name of the Appellants in\\n\\nthe revenue record and no application for change of\\n\\nmutation, etc. was moved by the 2nd Respondent.\\n\\nWe are informed that at a very belated stage, after\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_31\\\">Crl.

Respondent No. 2 neither objected to the\\n\\npayment of such compensation nor asserted his title\\n\\nover the land, which he normally would have done\\n\\nhad he possessed any rights over it.

A certified\\n\\ncopy of this GPA is said to have been relied upon to\\n\\nexecute       the     disputed        sale      deed.      We     fail    to\\n\\nunderstand or comprehend as to how a bona fide\\n\\npurchaser could pay crores of rupees as sale\\n\\nconsideration to a person who neither possesses\\n\\ndocuments showing ownership and title nor has\\n\\noriginal GPA of the true owner(s) of the property\\n\\nbeing sold. The fact that the sale deed was allegedly\\n\\nexecuted without mentioning the PAN Number or\\n\\nwithout deducting TDS, underlines the dubious\\n\\nnature of this transaction.
