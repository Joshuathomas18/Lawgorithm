We are also not able to endorse the opinion expressed by our learned\\n      Brother, Venkatarama Ayyar that a declaration of unconstitutionality\\n      brought about by lack of legislative power stands on a different footing from\\n      a declaration of unconstitutionality brought about by reason of abridgement\\n      of fundamental rights. We think that it is not a correct proposition that\\n      constitutional provisions in Part III of our Constitution merely operate as a\\n      check on the exercise of legislative power. It is axiomatic that when the law-\\n      making power of a State is restricted by a written fundamental law, then any\\n      law enacted and opposed to the fundamental law is in excess of the\\n      legislative authority and is thus a nullity. Both these declarations of\\n      unconstitutionality go to the root of the power itself and there is no real\\n      distinction between them. They represent but two aspects of want of\\n      legislative power. The legislative power of Parliament and the State\\n      Legislatures as conferred by <a href=\\\"/doc/574894/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Articles 245</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/77052/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">246</a> of the Constitution stands\\n      curtailed by the fundamental rights chapter of Constitution.

Uppal14 a Division Bench of this High Court held that plea of financial\\n\\nconstraints cannot be raised by the State with regard to only some categories\\n\\nof it&#x27;s employees and principle of &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot; has to be\\n\\napplied by it without discrimination amongst them. It held:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_31\\\">             &quot; 20.....\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_32\\\">                   ... Pleadings of the parties extracted above, would thus, manifest\\n         that it is only the category of the petitioners, which has been singled out,\\n         whereas all other employees, even of the appellant Corporation, have been\\n         given increase in their pay scales, as commensurate to their counterparts,\\n         i.e.,\\n          .e., holding the same posts in the Government Departments. Not only that,\\n         the said increase has been given to the posts held by other Engineers,\\n         inasmuch as, even those, who are holding engineering posts above the rank\\n         of the petitioners, have also been given a similar pay hike. It is only three\\n         categories of the petitioners, which have been left out. Is there any\\n         justification for the same, is, thus, the only question to be determined? We\\n         find nothing at all mentioned in\\n                                       in the written statement or that might have\\n         been urged during the course of arguments, which may justify increase in the\\n         pay scales of all other categories of the employees of the Corporation\\n         including those, who are holding engineering posts, and not the ppetitioners.\\n         Decision of the Government in, thus. rejecting the proposal of the Board of\\n         Directors smacks of individuous discrimination and thus straightaway comes\\n         within the vice of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_34\\\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.
