Consequently, the MACT held that it was a case of\\n\\n     contributory negligence on the part of the deceased Satpal\\n\\n     Singh, as also on the part of the driver of the Maruti car.\\n\\n     4.1.   The MACT applied the multiplier of 13, since the\\n\\n            deceased was a little over 40 years of age at the time of\\n\\n            his death.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_17\\\">     4.2.

Since it was a\\n\\n            case of contributory negligence, the compensation was\\n\\n            reduced by 50%, which worked out to Rs. 1.80 lacs. An\\n\\n            amount of Rs. 10,000 was awarded towards funeral\\n\\n            expenses.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\">                The compensation of Rs. 1,90,000 would carry\\n\\n            Interest @9% p.a. from the date of filing the claim, till\\n\\n            the date of payment.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\">     4.4.

With respect to the income of the deceased, the High\\n\\n       Court proceeded on the basis of the letter dated\\n\\n       27.06.1997 issued by the High Speed Group, , wherein\\n\\n       it was stated that Satpal Singh was working as a\\n\\n       General Manager, and drawing a salary of $ 6,700 p.m.\\n\\n       which would be equivalent to Rs. 2,68,000 p.m. at the\\n\\n       time when the claim was filed.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_24\\\">5.3.

Where the deceased\\n    was self-employed or was on a fixed salary (without provision\\n    for annual increments etc.), the courts will usually take only the\\n    actual income at the time of death.

It was held :\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_15\\\">    “57. Having bestowed our anxious consideration, we are\\n    disposed to think when we accept the principle of\\n    standardization, there is really no rationale not to apply the\\n    said principle to the self-employed or a person who is on a fixed\\n    salary. To follow the doctrine of actual income at the time of\\n    death and not to add any amount with regard to future\\n    prospects to the income for the purpose of determination of\\n    multiplicand would be unjust. The determination of income\\n    while computing compensation has to include future prospects\\n    so that the method will come within the ambit and sweep of just\\n    compensation as postulated Under <a href=\\\"/doc/41160316/\\\" id=\\\"a_27\\\">Section 168</a> of the Act. In\\n    case of a deceased who had held a permanent job with inbuilt\\n    grant of annual increment, there is an acceptable certainty. But\\n    to state that the legal representatives of a deceased who was\\n    on a fixed salary would not be entitled to the benefit of future\\n    prospects for the purpose of computation of compensation\\n    would be inapposite. It is because the criterion of distinction\\n    between the two in that event would be certainty on the one\\n    hand and staticness on the other. One may perceive that the\\n    comparative measure is certainty on the one hand and\\n    uncertainty on the other but such a perception is fallacious. It is\\n    because the price rise does affect a self-employed person; and\\n    that apart there is always an incessant effort to enhance one&#x27;s\\n    income for sustenance. The purchasing capacity of a salaried\\n    person on permanent job when increases because of grant of\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_53\\\">                                 18</span>\\n\\fincrements and pay revision or for some other change in service\\nconditions, there is always a competing attitude in the private\\nsector to enhance the salary to get better efficiency from the\\nemployees. Similarly, a person who is self-employed is bound to\\ngarner his resources and raise his charges/fees so that he can\\nlive with same facilities. To have the perception that he is likely\\nto remain static and his income to remain stagnant is contrary\\nto the fundamental concept of human attitude which always\\nintends to live with dynamism and move and change with the\\ntime. Though it may seem appropriate that there cannot be\\ncertainty in addition of future prospects to the existing income\\nunlike in the case of a person having a permanent job, yet the\\nsaid perception does not really deserve acceptance. We are\\ninclined to think that there can be some degree of difference as\\nregards the percentage that is meant for or applied to in respect\\nof the legal representatives who claim on behalf of the deceased\\nwho had a permanent job than a person who is self-employed\\nor on a fixed salary. But not to apply the principle of\\nstandardization on the foundation of perceived lack of certainty\\nwould tantamount to remaining oblivious to the marrows of\\nground reality. And, therefore, degree-test is imperative. Unless\\nthe degree-test is applied and left to the parties to adduce\\nevidence to establish, it would be unfair and inequitable. The\\ndegree-test has to have the inbuilt concept of percentage.\\nTaking into consideration the cumulative factors, namely,\\npassage of time, the changing society, escalation of price, the\\nchange in price index, the human attitude to follow a particular\\npattern of life, etc., an addition of 40% of the established\\nincome of the deceased towards future prospects and where\\nthe deceased was below 40 years an addition of 25% where\\nthe deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years would be\\nreasonable.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_16\\\">59. The controversy does not end here. The question still\\nremains whether there should be no addition where the age of\\nthe deceased is more than 50 years. Sarla Verma thinks it\\nappropriate not to add any amount and the same has been\\napproved in Reshma Kumari. Judicial notice can be taken of the\\nfact that salary does not remain the same. When a person is in\\na permanent job, there is always an enhancement due to one\\nreason or the other. To lay down as a thumb Rule that there\\nwill be no addition after 50 years will be an unacceptable\\nconcept. We are disposed to think, there should be an addition\\nof 15% if the deceased is between the age of 50 to 60 years and\\nthere should be no addition thereafter. Similarly, in case of self-\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_68\\\">employed or person on fixed salary, the addition should be 10%\\nbetween the age of 50 to 60 years.

By\\n\\n       taking an increment of 10% per annum from 1984 till\\n\\n       1998, the notional income of the deceased could be\\n\\n       fixed at 2590 Qatari Riyal p.m., which can be rounded\\n\\n       off to 2600 Qatari Riyal p.m. As per the exchange rate\\n\\n       prevailing in 1998, 1 Qatari Riyal was equivalent to\\n\\n       12.41 INR. Accordingly, the income of the deceased\\n\\n       would work out to 2600 x 12.41 = Rs. 32,266 p.m. i.e.\\n\\n       Rs. 3,87,192 p.a.\\n\\n9.2.   Even though in <a href=\\\"/doc/837924/\\\" id=\\\"a_36\\\">Sarla Verma</a> (supra), it was held that\\n\\n       the deduction towards personal and living expenses\\n\\n       should be 1/4th, if the number of dependant family\\n\\n       members is four, in the present case, we feel that 50%\\n\\n       of the income of the deceased would be required to be\\n\\n       deducted, since he was living in a foreign country.\\n\\n           The deceased had to maintain an establishment\\n\\n       there,   and   incur   expenditure   for   the   same   in\\n\\n       commensurate with the high cost of living in a foreign\\n\\n       country. Therefore, we are of the view that the High\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_70\\\">                              29</span>\\n\\f       Court rightly deducted 50% of his income towards\\n\\n       personal and living expenses.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_101\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"74988840\\\" id=\\\"span_71\\\">9.3.   In the present case, the courts below failed to award\\n\\n       any amount towards future prospects. The deceased\\n\\n       Satpal Singh was just over 40 years of age at the time\\n\\n       of his death. As per the judgment of the Constitution\\n\\n       Bench in <a href=\\\"/doc/74988840/\\\" id=\\\"a_37\\\">Pranay Sethi</a> (supra), future prospects @30%\\n\\n       are to be awarded for computing the compensation\\n\\n       payable to the Claimants.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_102\\\">9.4.   The multiplicand for computing the compensation\\n\\n       would therefore, work out to Rs. 3,87,192 – 50% + 30%\\n\\n       = Rs. 2,51,675.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_103\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"837924\\\" id=\\\"span_72\\\">9.5.   The deceased Satpal Singh was 40 years of age at the\\n\\n       time of his death. Accordingly, the multiplier of 15\\n\\n       would be the appropriate multiplier as per the table set\\n\\n       out in <a href=\\\"/doc/837924/\\\" id=\\\"a_38\\\">Sarla Verma</a> (supra).</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_104\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"175246407\\\" id=\\\"span_73\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"74988840\\\" id=\\\"span_74\\\">9.6.   Multiplying the multiplicand of Rs. 2,51,675 by the\\n\\n       multiplier of 15, the loss of dependency payable to the\\n\\n       Claimants would work out to Rs. 37,75,125.\\n\\n9.7.
