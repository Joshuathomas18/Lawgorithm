The High\\n\\n     Court in the appeal filed by the appellant, modified the order of\\n\\n     sentence passed by the Sessions Court, by reducing the\\n\\n     substantive sentence to 7 years with fine of Rs.5,000/- and\\n\\n     confirmed the direction with regard to the payment of compensation\\n\\n     to the prosecutrix. It is stated that the appellant has paid the\\n\\n     amount of compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- to the prosecutrix as\\n\\n     directed by the High Court.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">4.   The case of the prosecution as laid before the Sessions Court was\\n\\n     that the prosecutrix was residing in a tenanted premises at C-1/3/5,\\n\\n     Sanjay Enclave, Uttam Nagar, Delhi with her husband and three\\n\\n     children in the year 2009. The accused was also residing in a\\n\\n     tenanted premises which was situated in front of her house. On\\n\\n     21.03.2015, the prosecutrix lodged a complaint against the accused\\n\\n     alleging inter alia that the accused was persuading her by stating\\n\\n     that her husband was not earning sufficient income and that he (the\\n\\n     accused) had a good job and he would maintain her according to\\n\\n     his status. The accused also assured her that he would solemnize\\n\\n     marriage (nikah) with her. Thereafter, the accused with an intention\\n\\n     to have illicit intercourse with her, used to call her at various places,\\n\\n     as a result thereof, she was impregnated in the year 2011. She\\n\\n     further alleged that the accused persuaded the prosecutrix that\\n\\n     after the delivery of child, he would marry her. He also assured her\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">\\f                                    3</span>\\n\\n     that he was not a married man and after the marriage, he would\\n\\n     take her to his native place. In the year 2012, the accused enticed\\n\\n     her away in another rented premises at Kapashera Border Nathu\\n\\n     Mal Building and continued to have illicit relationship with her. After\\n\\n     sometime the accused vacated the said rented premises with a\\n\\n     false excuse that his parents were severely ill and he had to visit his\\n\\n     native place. He told the prosecutrix to take shelter in a shelter\\n\\n     home along with the minor child Naman. He also forced her to take\\n\\n     divorce from her husband. The prosecutrix had further alleged in\\n\\n     the complaint that the accused had lied to her that he had gone to\\n\\n     his native place, but in fact he had not gone, which she came to\\n\\n     know when she visited the call center where the accused was\\n\\n     working. When she made hue and cry at his place of working, he\\n\\n     assured her that he would soon marry her. In the year 2012, she\\n\\n     visited the native place of the accused and came to know that he\\n\\n     was already married and had children also. The parents of the\\n\\n     accused refused to keep her there. Thereafter, also the accused\\n\\n     kept on assuring her to marry her but did not marry. Hence, the\\n\\n     complaint was filed. The said complaint was registered as the FIR\\n\\n     No.412/2015 at Police Station Bindapur, District South West, Delhi\\n\\n     on 21.03.2015 against the accused for the offence under <a href=\\\"/doc/1279834/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Section\\n\\n     376</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">5.   After the examination of eleven witnesses by the prosecution, the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">\\f                                     4</span>\\n\\n     incriminating evidence was brought to the notice of the accused for\\n\\n     the purpose of explanation under <a href=\\\"/doc/767287/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section 313</a> of Cr.PC, however\\n\\n     the accused denied the allegations levelled against him and further\\n\\n     stated that he was having consensual physical relations with the\\n\\n     prosecutrix and that she was aware that he was a married person\\n\\n     having children, and that she had also met his wife at his house. He\\n\\n     had also stated that he was providing financial help to the\\n\\n     prosecutrix regularly, and when he refused to fulfil her demand of\\n\\n     Rs.1.5 lakh to Rs.2 lakhs, she lodged a false case against him. The\\n\\n     Sessions Court after appreciating the evidence on record convicted\\n\\n     and sentenced the appellant-accused as stated hereinabove.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">6.   The Learned counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently\\n\\n     submitted that the Sessions Court and the High Court had failed to\\n\\n     appreciate the evidence in the right perspective, and convicted the\\n\\n     appellant under <a href=\\\"/doc/1279834/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Section 376</a> IPC, which has resulted into gross\\n\\n     miscarriage of justice.

He\\n\\n            further submitted that even as per her own story, the appellant had\\n\\n            not disowned the responsibility of the child born from his loin and\\n\\n            she continued to have relationship with the accused for about four\\n\\n            years after the birth of the child. It was only when the accused\\n\\n            refused to fulfill her demand of paying huge amount to her, she filed\\n\\n            the complaint. The learned counsel has relied upon the decisions of\\n\\n            this Court in case of Deelip Singh alias <a href=\\\"/doc/1181992/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Dilip Kumar vs. State of\\n\\n            Bihar1</a>; in case of <a href=\\\"/doc/89372902/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Prashant Bharti vs. State (NCT of Delhi</a>)2, and\\n\\n            in case of <a href=\\\"/doc/146590758/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Dr. Dhruvaram Murlidhar Sonar vs. State of\\n\\n            Maharashtra and Others3</a> to buttress his submission that the\\n\\n            consensual sexual relationship which if continued between the\\n\\n            parties for quite a long time, in the instant case for about five years,\\n\\n            could not be said to have continued under the ‘misconception of\\n\\n            fact’ under <a href=\\\"/doc/1742535/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Section 90</a> and could not be said to be ‘rape’ under\\n\\n            <a href=\\\"/doc/623254/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Section 375</a> IPC.</span></span></span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">    7.

According to him, even\\n\\n     otherwise, the prosecution had proved beyond doubt that the\\n\\n     appellant-accused had lured the prosecutrix to have sexual\\n\\n     relationship with him by giving her a false promise that he would\\n\\n     marry her, however, he committed breach of the promise after she\\n\\n     delivered the child, which clearly proved that her consent was\\n\\n     obtained by the appellant under the misconception of fact.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">8.   Since the prosecutrix was not being represented by any lawyer,\\n\\n     though served, the court had appointed Ms. Indira Jaising, Senior\\n\\n     Advocate as an Amicus Curiae to assist the Court on her behalf.\\n\\n     She in addition to her written submissions, further submitted that\\n\\n     there was a clear distinction between ‘rape’ and ‘consensual sex’,\\n\\n     and that the Court was required to carefully examine as to whether\\n\\n     the accused had with malafide motives made false promise of\\n\\n     marriage or it was a mere breach of promise by the accused.\\n\\n     According to her, the courts below had rightly appreciated the\\n\\n     evidence of the prosecutrix for arriving at the conclusion that the\\n\\n     consent of the prosecutrix to have sexual relationship with the\\n\\n     accused was under the misconception of fact under <a href=\\\"/doc/1742535/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Section 90</a> of\\n\\n     the IPC and therefore the case of the prosecutrix fell under the\\n\\n     Clause - Secondly of <a href=\\\"/doc/623254/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Section 375</a> IPC.

It would be germane to note that the basic principles of criminal\\n\\n      jurisprudence warrant that the prosecution has to prove the guilt of\\n\\n      the accused beyond reasonable doubt by leading cogent evidence,\\n\\n      however, considering the ethos and culture of the Indian Society,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_17\\\">\\f                                     9</span>\\n\\n      and considering the rising graph of the commission of the social\\n\\n      crime – ‘Rape’, the courts have been permitted to raise a legal\\n\\n      presumption as contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1953529/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Section 114A</a> of the Indian Evidence\\n\\n      Act. As per Section 114A, a presumption could be raised as to the\\n\\n      absence of consent in certain cases pertaining to Rape. As per the\\n\\n      said provision, if sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and\\n\\n      the question arises as to whether it was without the consent of the\\n\\n      woman alleged to have been raped, and if she states in her\\n\\n      evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall\\n\\n      presume that she did not consent.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">11.   It cannot be gainsaid that a consent given by a person would not be\\n\\n      a consent as intended by any Section of the <a href=\\\"/doc/1569253/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Indian Penal Code</a>, if\\n\\n      such consent was given by the person under the fear of injury, or\\n\\n      under a misconception of fact as contemplated in <a href=\\\"/doc/1742535/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">Section 90</a> IPC.\\n\\n      Further, Section 375 also describes certain acts which if committed\\n\\n      by the accused under the circumstances mentioned therein, as the\\n\\n      commission of ‘Rape’, even though committed with the consent of\\n\\n      the prosecutrix. In our opinion, the expression “misconception of\\n\\n      fact” contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1742535/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">Section 90</a> IPC is also required to be appreciated\\n\\n      in the light of the Clauses – contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/623254/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Section 375</a> IPC, more\\n\\n      particularly the Clauses - Thirdly, Fourthly and Fifthly thereof, when\\n\\n      the accused is charged for the offence of ‘rape’. The circumstances\\n\\n      described in the said three Clauses are wider than the expression\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_18\\\">\\f                                    10</span>\\n\\n      “misconception of fact”, as contemplated in <a href=\\\"/doc/1742535/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">Section 90</a> of IPC.\\n\\n      Section 375 describes seven circumstances under which the ‘rape’\\n\\n      could be said to have been committed. As per the Clause - Thirdly,\\n\\n      a rape could be said to have been committed, even with her\\n\\n      consent, when the consent of the prosecutrix is obtained by putting\\n\\n      her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of death or of\\n\\n      hurt. As per the Clause - Fourthly, with her consent, when the man\\n\\n      knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given\\n\\n      because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or\\n\\n      believes herself to be lawfully married; and as per the Clause -\\n\\n      Fifthly, with her consent when at the time of giving the consent, the\\n\\n      prosecutrix by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the\\n\\n      administration of stupefying or unwholesome substance by the\\n\\n      accused or through another, she is unable to understand the nature\\n\\n      and consequences of that to which she gives consent. Thus, apart\\n\\n      from the prosecutrix being under the misconception of fact as\\n\\n      contemplated in <a href=\\\"/doc/1507394/\\\" id=\\\"a_25\\\">Section 90</a>, her consent would be treated as ‘no\\n\\n      consent’ if she had given her consent under any of the\\n\\n      circumstances mentioned in <a href=\\\"/doc/623254/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">Section 375</a> of IPC.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_15\\\">12.

The first two sentences in the above passage\\n             need some explanation. While we reiterate that a\\n             promise to marry without anything more will not give\\n             rise to “misconception of fact” within the meaning of\\n             <a href=\\\"/doc/1507394/\\\" id=\\\"a_35\\\">Section 90</a>, it needs to be clarified that a\\n             representation deliberately made by the accused\\n             with a view to elicit the assent of the victim without\\n             having the intention or inclination to marry her, will\\n             vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is established\\n             that at the very inception of the making of promise,\\n             the accused did not really entertain the intention of\\n             marrying her and the promise to marry held out by\\n             him was a mere hoax, the consent ostensibly given\\n             by the victim will be of no avail to the accused to\\n             exculpate him from the ambit of Section 375 clause\\n             secondly. This is what in fact was stressed by the\\n             Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in the\\n             case of Jayanti Rani Panda [1984 Cri LJ 1535 :\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_21\\\">             <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1100330\\\" id=\\\"span_26\\\">(1983) 2 CHN 290 (Cal)] which was approvingly\\n             referred to in <a href=\\\"/doc/1100330/\\\" id=\\\"a_36\\\">Uday</a> case [(2003) 4 SCC 46 : 2003\\n             SCC (Cri) 775 : (2003) 2 Scale 329] . The Calcutta\\n             High Court rightly qualified the proposition which it\\n             stated earlier by adding the qualification at the end\\n             (Cri LJ p. 1538, para 7) — “unless the court can be\\n             assured that from the very inception the accused\\n             never really intended to marry her”.</span> (emphasis\\n             supplied) In the next para, the High Court referred\\n             to the vintage decision of the Chancery Court which\\n             laid down that a misstatement of the intention of the\\n             defendant in doing a particular act would\\n             tantamount to a misstatement of fact and an action\\n             of deceit can be founded on it.

There may be a case where the\\n                    prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on\\n\\n5 (2013) 7 SCC 675\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_30\\\">\\f                                   15</span>\\n\\n              account of her love and passion for the accused,\\n              and not solely on account of misrepresentation\\n              made to her by the accused, or where an accused\\n              on account of circumstances which he could not\\n              have foreseen, or which were beyond his control,\\n              was unable to marry her, despite having every\\n              intention to do so. Such cases must be treated\\n              differently. An accused can be convicted for rape\\n              only if the court reaches a conclusion that the\\n              intention of the accused was mala fide, and that he\\n              had clandestine motives.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_23\\\">              22.   xxxxx\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_24\\\">              23.   xxxxx\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_25\\\">              24. Hence, it is evident that there must be adequate\\n              evidence to show that at the relevant time i.e. at the\\n              initial stage itself, the accused had no intention\\n              whatsoever, of keeping his promise to marry the\\n              victim. There may, of course, be circumstances,\\n              when a person having the best of intentions is\\n              unable to marry the victim owing to various\\n              unavoidable circumstances. The “failure to keep a\\n              promise made with respect to a future uncertain\\n              date, due to reasons that are not very clear from the\\n              evidence available, does not always amount to\\n              misconception of fact.

There is also a\\n               distinction between mere breach of a promise and\\n               not fulfilling a false promise. If the accused has not\\n               made the promise with the sole intention to seduce\\n               the prosecutrix to indulge in sexual acts, such an\\n               act would not amount to rape. There may be a case\\n               where the prosecutrix agrees to have sexual\\n               intercourse on account of her love and passion for\\n               the accused and not solely on account of the\\n               misconception created by accused, or where an\\n               accused, on account of circumstances which he\\n               could not have foreseen or which were beyond his\\n               control, was unable to marry her despite having\\n               every intention to do. Such cases must be treated\\n               differently. If the complainant had any mala fide\\n               intention and if he had clandestine motives, it is a\\n               clear case of rape. The acknowledged consensual\\n               physical relationship between the parties would not\\n               constitute an offence under <a href=\\\"/doc/1279834/\\\" id=\\\"a_44\\\">Section 376</a> IPC.”\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_22\\\">18.   Now, in the instant case, having regard to the statutory provisions\\n\\n      and their interpretations by this Court in various judgements, one\\n\\n      may be tempted to hold the appellant-accused guilty of the offence\\n\\n      under <a href=\\\"/doc/1279834/\\\" id=\\\"a_45\\\">Section 376</a> IPC as has been done by the Sessions Court\\n\\n      and the High Court, however, on the closer scrutiny of the evidence\\n\\n      on record, we find that it was fallacy on the part of the courts below\\n\\n      to hold the appellant guilty under <a href=\\\"/doc/1279834/\\\" id=\\\"a_46\\\">Section 376</a> IPC.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_23\\\">19.   After duly examining the record in the light of the submissions made\\n\\n      by the learned counsels for the parties, following facts have\\n\\n      emerged: -\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_27\\\">      (i)  Prosecutrix was a married woman having three children.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_28\\\">      (ii) Accused was staying in a tenanted premises situated in front\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_33\\\">\\f                                      17</span>\\n\\n              of the house of the prosecutrix.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_29\\\">      (iii)   Though initially hesitant, the prosecutrix developed liking for\\n\\n              the accused, and both started having sexual relationship with\\n\\n              each other.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_30\\\">      (iv)    The prosecutrix delivered a male child on 28/10/2011 from\\n\\n              the loin of the accused.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_31\\\">      (v)     The prosecutrix went to the native place of the accused in\\n\\n              2012 and came to know that he was a married man having\\n\\n              children.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_32\\\">      (vi)    The prosecutrix still continued to live with the accused in\\n\\n              separate premises.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_33\\\">      (vii)   The prosecutrix and her husband took divorce by mutual\\n\\n              consent in 2014 and thereafter prosecutrix permanently left\\n\\n             her three children with her husband.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_34\\\">      (viii) The prosecutrix lodged the complaint on 21 st March, 2015\\n\\n              alleging that she had consented for sexual relationship with\\n\\n              the accused as the accused had promised her to marry and\\n\\n           subsequently did not marry.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_24\\\">20.   The bone of contention raised on behalf of the respondents is that\\n\\n      the prosecutrix had given her consent for sexual relationship under\\n\\n      the misconception of fact, as the accused had given a false promise\\n\\n      to marry her and subsequently he did not marry, and therefore such\\n\\n      consent was no consent in the eye of law and the case fell under\\n\\n      the Clause – Secondly of <a href=\\\"/doc/623254/\\\" id=\\\"a_47\\\">Section 375</a> IPC. In this regard, it is\\n\\n      pertinent to note that there is a difference between giving a false\\n\\n      promise and committing breach of promise by the accused. In case\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_34\\\">\\f                                    18</span>\\n\\n      of false promise, the accused right from the beginning would not\\n\\n      have any intention to marry the prosecutrix and would have cheated\\n\\n      or deceited the prosecutrix by giving a false promise to marry her\\n\\n      only with a view to satisfy his lust, whereas in case of breach of\\n\\n      promise, one cannot deny a possibility that the accused might have\\n\\n      given a promise with all seriousness to marry her, and subsequently\\n\\n      might have encountered certain circumstances unforeseen by him\\n\\n      or the circumstances beyond his control, which prevented him to\\n\\n      fulfill his promise. So, it would be a folly to treat each breach of\\n\\n      promise to marry as a false promise and to prosecute a person for\\n\\n      the offence under Section 376. As stated earlier, each case would\\n\\n      depend upon its proved facts before the court.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_25\\\">21.   In the instant case, the prosecutrix who herself was a married\\n\\n      woman having three children, could not be said to have acted under\\n\\n      the alleged false promise given by the appellant or under the\\n\\n      misconception of fact while giving the consent to have sexual\\n\\n      relationship with the appellant. Undisputedly, she continued to have\\n\\n      such relationship with him at least for about five years till she gave\\n\\n      complaint in the year 2015. Even if the allegations made by her in\\n\\n      her deposition before the court, are taken on their face value, then\\n\\n      also to construe such allegations as ‘rape’ by the appellant, would\\n\\n      be stretching the case too far. The prosecutrix being a married\\n\\n      woman and the mother of three children was matured and\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_35\\\">\\f                              19</span>\\n\\nintelligent enough to understand the significance and the\\n\\nconsequences of the moral or immoral quality of act she was\\n\\nconsenting to. Even otherwise, if her entire conduct during the\\n\\ncourse of such relationship with the accused, is closely seen, it\\n\\nappears that she had betrayed her husband and three children by\\n\\nhaving relationship with the accused, for whom she had developed\\n\\nliking for him. She had gone to stay with him during the subsistence\\n\\nof her marriage with her husband, to live a better life with the\\n\\naccused. Till the time she was impregnated by the accused in the\\n\\nyear 2011, and she gave birth to a male child through the loin of the\\n\\naccused, she did not have any complaint against the accused of he\\n\\nhaving given false promise to marry her or having cheated her. She\\n\\nalso visited the native place of the accused in the year 2012 and\\n\\ncame to know that he was a married man having children also, still\\n\\nshe continued to live with the accused at another premises without\\n\\nany grievance. She even obtained divorce from her husband by\\n\\nmutual consent in 2014, leaving her three children with her\\n\\nhusband. It was only in the year 2015 when some disputes must\\n\\nhave taken place between them, that she filed the present\\n\\ncomplaint. The accused in his further statement recorded under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/767287/\\\" id=\\\"a_48\\\">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. had stated that she had filed the complaint\\n\\nas he refused to fulfill her demand to pay her huge amount. Thus,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_36\\\">\\f                                    20</span>\\n\\n      having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, it could\\n\\n      not be said by any stretch of imagination that the prosecutrix had\\n\\n      given her consent for the sexual relationship with the appellant\\n\\n      under the misconception of fact, so as to hold the appellant guilty of\\n\\n      having committed rape within the meaning of <a href=\\\"/doc/623254/\\\" id=\\\"a_49\\\">Section 375</a> of IPC.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_26\\\">22.   In that view of the matter, the accused deserves to be acquitted\\n\\n      from the charges levelled against him. Of course, the direction for\\n\\n      payment of compensation given by the courts below shall remain\\n\\n      unchanged as the appellant had accepted the responsibility of the\\n\\n      child, and has also paid the amount of compensation to the\\n\\n      prosecutrix.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">23.
