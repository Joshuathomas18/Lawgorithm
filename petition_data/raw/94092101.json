The land in dispute measured\\n\\n       0.19 decimals and appertain to Khata Nos. 90, 184 and 214 of\\n\\n       Mauza-Jahngar Toli, P.S. Banmankhi in the district of Purnea. The\\n\\n       original private respondent No.5, who is dead now, filed an\\n\\n       application under <a href=\\\"/doc/57698652/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Section 16 (3)</a> of the Act claiming preemption on\\n\\n       the ground that he was the adjoining raiyat.

The Additional Collector,\\n\\n       Purnea, in Ceiling Appeal No.43 of 1986-87 affirmed the order of\\n\\n       the Deputy Collector Land Reforms. However, not being satisfied\\n\\n       with the two decisions, the respondent No.5 preferred the Revision\\n\\n       Case No. 563 of 1990 before the Additional Member, Board of\\n\\n       Revenue. The revision application was allowed, therefore, writ\\n\\n       application was filed.

Mere issuance of a\\n\\n       notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/61403264/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">Section 3</a> would not create the bar, which has\\n\\n       been contemplated under Section 5 of the Consolidation Act and\\n\\n       something more was required to be done or happen before the bar\\n\\n       will set in. In this regard, attention of the Court has been drawn to\\n\\n       a Division Bench decision rendered in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/69632267/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Surendra Rai\\n\\n       and Others vs. The State of Bihar and Others</a>, reported in\\n\\n       2015(2) PLJR 774.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">                    The Division Bench, while dealing with the similar kind\\n\\n       of dispute, had this to say in the following paragraphs :\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">                              &quot;14.

It is rather unfortunate that even after\\n\\n                 remand of the matter by the High Court mainly on the\\n\\n                 ground that the order passed by the 1 st respondent on earlier\\n\\n                 occasion was without any reasons; the 1 st respondent did not\\n\\n                 choose to mention any reason whatever.

It   has      already   been   mentioned       that\\n\\n                 prohibitions contained under the Act are of two kinds. The\\n\\n                 first is the one under <a href=\\\"/doc/25171382/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Section 4</a> consequent upon publication\\n\\n                 of Notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/61403264/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Section 3</a>. This, however, does not\\n\\n                 prohibit the transfer of land from one from person to\\n\\n                 another. It only prohibits the alteration of entries in the\\n\\n                 revenue records or institution of the suits. Voluntary or inter\\n\\n                 vivos transfers are not prohibited. Prohibition against such\\n\\n                 transfers, be it in the form of sale, mortgage, gift or\\n\\n                 exchange comes into play under <a href=\\\"/doc/23999835/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Section 5</a>; only with the\\n\\n                 publication of registers under <a href=\\\"/doc/60316076/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Section 10</a>.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\"> Patna High Court LPA No.439 of 2016 dt.26-06-2018\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">                                             6/9</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">                              17.

Such an\\n\\n                 exercise is totally lacking in the instant case.

Case No.89 of 1999 is set aside.&quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    The submission was further expanded on behalf of the\\n\\n       learned counsel for the appellants that the basis of the Division\\n Patna High Court LPA No.439 of 2016 dt.26-06-2018\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">                                             7/9</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Bench is that even though a notification under Section 3 of the\\n\\n       Consolidation Act was issued sometime on 10.09.1975, but\\n\\n       nothing more in terms of exercise was carried out thereafter by any\\n\\n       of the authorities. To reinforce such a factual submission, a\\n\\n       supplementary affidavit has been filed annexing Annexure-1,\\n\\n       which is an information obtained under <a href=\\\"/doc/671631/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Right to Information Act</a>\\n\\n       and provided by the Deputy Director (Consolidation), Purnea, to\\n\\n       the question whether any consolidation proceeding was initiated in\\n\\n       the village concerned in the year 1975 and further anything\\n\\n       decisive was done thereafter. The response of the Deputy Director\\n\\n       is that even though a notification was initiated in the year 1975,\\n\\n       but since on a something known as &quot;Kosi Kranti Yojna&quot;, nothing\\n\\n       came to be done in relation to the consolidation in that area all the\\n\\n       proceedings were stopped and, therefore, the stage of Section\\n\\n       10(1) of the Consolidation Act was never reached. No publication\\n\\n       was ever issued with regard to the list of the lands and, therefore,\\n\\n       we are also of the opinion that the view taken by the Division\\n\\n       Bench in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/69632267/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Surendra Rai</a> (supra) will apply in the\\n\\n       present case and the decisions rendered by the Additional Member,\\n\\n       Board of Revenue and upheld by the learned single Judge in the\\n\\n       writ application seems to be falling in the teeth of the said\\n Patna High Court LPA No.439 of 2016 dt.26-06-2018\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">                                             8/9</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       decision.
