The prosecution case in brief is that one Professor TJ Joseph\\n\\nwhile framing the Malayalam question paper for the second semester\\n\\nB.Com. examination at the Newman College, Thodupuzha, had\\n\\nincluded a question which was considered objectionable against a\\n\\nparticular religion by certain sections of society. The respondent in\\n\\nassociation with other members of the Popular Front of India (PFI),\\n\\ndecided to avenge this purported act of blasphemy. On 04.07.2010 at\\n\\nabout 8AM, a group of people with a common object, attacked the\\n\\nvictim­professor while he was returning home with his mother and\\n\\nsister after attending Sunday mass at a local Church. Over the course\\n\\nof the attack, members of the PFI forcefully intercepted the victim’s\\n\\ncar, restrained him and chopped­off his right palm with choppers,\\n\\nknives, and a small axe. Country­made bombs were also hurled at\\n\\nbystanders to create panic and terror in their minds and to prevent\\n\\nthem from coming to the aid of the victim. An FIR was consequently\\n\\nlodged against the attackers by the victim­professor’s wife under\\n\\nSections 143, 147, 148, 120­B, 341, 427, 323, 324, 326, 506(H), 307,\\n\\n149 of <a href=\\\"/doc/1569253/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">IPC</a>; and <a href=\\\"/doc/1056565/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Section 3</a> of Explosive Substances Act.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">4.   It emerged over the course of investigation that the attack was\\n\\npart of a larger conspiracy involving meticulous pre­planning,\\n\\nnumerous failed attempts and use of dangerous weapons. Accordingly,\\n\\n\\n                                                             Page | 2\\n\\fseveral   dozen   persons   including   the   present   respondent   were\\n\\narraigned by the police. It was alleged that the respondent was one of\\n\\nthe main conspirators and the provisions contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/345634/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">Sections 153A</a>,\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/386021/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">201</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/162723/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">202</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/66955/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">212</a> of IPC, along with Section 16, 18, 18­B, 19 and 20 of\\n\\nthe UAPA were also thus invoked against him. However, owing to him\\n\\nbeing untraceable, the respondent was declared an absconder and his\\n\\ntrial was split up from the rest of his co­conspirators. The co­accused\\n\\nof the respondent were tried and most of them were found guilty by\\n\\nthe Special Court, NIA vide order dated 30.04.2015 and were awarded\\n\\ncumulative sentence ranging between two and eight­years’ rigorous\\n\\nimprisonment.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">5.   The respondent could be arrested on 10.04.2015 only and a\\n\\nchargesheet was re­filed by the National Investigation Agency against\\n\\nhim, pursuant to which the respondent is now facing trial. The\\n\\nrespondent approached the Special Court and the High Court for bail\\n\\nas many as six times between 2015 and 2019, seeking leniency on\\n\\ngrounds of his limited role in the offence and claiming parity with\\n\\nother co­accused who had been enlarged on bail or acquitted. Save for\\n\\nthe impugned order, bail was declined to the respondent, observing\\n\\nthat prima facie he had prior knowledge of the offence, had assisted\\n\\nand facilitated the attack, arranged vehicle and SIM cards, himself\\n\\nwaited near the place of occurrence, transported the perpetrators,\\n\\n\\n                                                                 Page | 3\\n\\fsheltered, and medically assisted them afterwards. The Courts were,\\n\\ntherefore, of the view that the bar against grant of bail under Section\\n\\n43­D (5) of the UAPA was attracted.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">6.        The respondent again approached the High Court in May, 2019\\n\\nfor the third time, questioning the Special Court’s order denying bail.\\n\\nThe High Court through the impugned order, released the respondent\\n\\non bail noting that the trial was yet to begin though the respondent\\n\\nhad been in custody for four years. Placing emphasis on the mandate\\n\\nfor an expeditious trial under the <a href=\\\"/doc/51730711/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">National Investigation Agency Act,\\n\\n2008</a>, the High Court held that the undertrial­respondent could not be\\n\\nkept in custody for too long when the trial was not likely to commence\\n\\nin the near future, for not doing so would cause serious prejudice and\\n\\nsuffering to him. The operation of the aforementioned bail order was,\\n\\nhowever, stayed by this Court. Resultantly, the respondent has spent\\n\\nnearly five years and five months in judicial custody.\\n\\nCONTENTIONS\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"117627977\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">7.        Learned Additional Solicitor General, for the appellant, argued\\n\\nthat the High Court erred in granting bail without adverting to the\\n\\nstatutory rigours of Section 43­D(5) of UAPA. Relying upon judgment\\n\\nin <a href=\\\"/doc/117627977/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">National Investigation Agency v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali</a> 1,\\n\\nit was highlighted that bail proceedings under the special enactment\\n\\nwere distinct and the Courts are duty­bound to refuse bail where the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">1</span>\\n    (2019) 5 SCC 1.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">                                                                 Page | 4\\n\\fsuspect is prima facie believed to be guilty. It was further contended\\n\\nthat in numerous prior rounds before the Special Court and the High\\n\\nCourt, there emerged enough reasons to believe that the respondent\\n\\nwas, prima facie, guilty of the accusations made against him. The fact\\n\\nthat the respondent had absconded for years was pressed into aid as\\n\\nlegitimate apprehension of his not returning if set free. As regard to\\n\\nthe early conclusion of trial, NIA has filed an additional affidavit\\n\\nsuggesting to examine 276 witnesses and at the same time expecting\\n\\nto conduct the trial on a day­to­day basis and complete it within\\n\\naround a year.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"1875650\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">8.   Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent, on the\\n\\nother hand, highlighted that many of the co­accused had been\\n\\nacquitted, and although a few had been convicted as well, but those\\n\\nconvicts had also been awarded a sentence of not more than eight\\n\\nyears. Given how the respondent has already suffered incarceration of\\n\\nalmost five­and­a­half years without the trial having even started, it\\n\\nwould violate his Constitutional liberty and rights to have him serve\\n\\nmost of his sentence without any adjudication of guilt by a judicial\\n\\nauthority. He urged that once the High Court had exercised discretion\\n\\nto grant bail, the same ought not to be interfered with except in rare\\n\\ncircumstances. Relying upon Shaheen Welfare Association v. Union\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                              Page | 5\\n\\fof <a href=\\\"/doc/1875650/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">India2 and Hussain v. Union of India,3</a> it was argued that such\\n\\nprotracted incarceration violates the respondent’s right to speedy trial\\n\\nand access to justice; in which case, Constitutional Courts could\\n\\nexercise their powers to grant bail, regardless of limitations specified\\n\\nunder special enactments.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">ANALYSIS\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">9.       It must be emphasised at the outset that there is a vivid\\n\\ndistinction between the parameters to be applied while considering a\\n\\nbail application, vis­à­vis those applicable while deciding a petition for\\n\\nits cancellation. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1012138\\\" id=\\\"span_10\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/1012138/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Puran v.

The afore­cited\\n\\ndecision holds as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">      “14. We may observe at the outset that we are conscious of the\\n      limitations which bind us while entertaining a plea against\\n      grant of bail by the lower court, that too, which is a superior\\n      court like High Court. It is expected that once the discretion\\n      is exercised by the High Court on relevant considerations\\n      and bail is granted, this Court would normally not\\n      interfere with such a discretion, unless it is found that\\n      the   discretion   itself   is   exercised     on   extraneous\\n      considerations and/or the relevant factors which need to\\n      be taken into account while exercising such a discretion\\n      are ignored or bypassed. ... There have to be very cogent\\n      and overwhelming circumstances that are necessary to\\n      interfere with the discretion in granting the bail. These\\n      material considerations are also spelled out in the\\n      aforesaid judgments viz. whether the accused would be\\n      readily available for his trial and whether he is likely to\\n      abuse the discretion granted in his favour by tampering\\n      with the evidence. …”\\n                                                   (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\">11.   It is a fact that the High Court in the instant case has not\\n\\ndetermined the likelihood of the respondent being guilty or not, or\\n\\nwhether rigours of Section 43­D(5) of UAPA are alien to him. The High\\n\\nCourt instead appears to have exercised its power to grant bail owing\\n\\nto the long period of incarceration and the unlikelihood of the trial\\n\\nbeing completed anytime in the near future. The reasons assigned by\\n\\n                                                                    Page | 7\\n\\fthe High Court are apparently traceable back to <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Article 21</a> of our\\n\\nConstitution, of course without addressing the statutory embargo\\n\\ncreated by Section 43­D (5) of UAPA.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_21\\\">12.   The High Court’s view draws support from a batch of decisions of\\n\\nthis Court, including in Shaheen Welfare Association (supra),\\n\\nlaying down that gross delay in disposal of such cases would justify\\n\\nthe invocation of <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and consequential\\n\\nnecessity to release the undertrial on bail. It would be useful to quote\\n\\nthe following observations from the cited case:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_3\\\">       “10. Bearing in mind the nature of the crime and the need to\\n       protect the society and the nation, TADA has prescribed in\\n       Section 20(8) stringent provisions for granting bail. Such\\n       stringent provisions can be justified looking to the\\n       nature of the crime, as was held in Kartar Singh\\n       case [(1994) 3 SCC 569 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 899] , on the\\n       presumption that the trial of the accused will take place\\n       without undue delay. No one can justify gross delay in\\n       disposal of cases when undertrials perforce remain in\\n       jail, giving rise to possible situations that may justify\\n       invocation of Article 21.”\\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_22\\\">13.

The facts of the instant case are more egregious than these two\\n\\nabove­cited instances. Not only has the respondent been in jail for\\n\\nmuch more than five years, but there are 276 witnesses left to be\\n\\nexamined. Charges have been framed only on 27.11.2020.               Still\\n\\nfurther, two opportunities were given to the appellant­NIA who has\\n\\nshown no inclination to screen its endless list of witnesses. It also\\n\\ndeserves mention that of the thirteen co­accused who have been\\n\\nconvicted, none have been given a sentence of more than eight years’\\n\\nrigorous imprisonment. It can therefore be legitimately expected that if\\n\\nfound guilty, the respondent too would receive a sentence within the\\n\\nsame ballpark. Given that two­third of such incarceration is already\\n\\ncomplete, it appears that the respondent has already paid heavily for\\n\\nhis acts of fleeing from justice.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_30\\\">16.       This Court has clarified in numerous judgments that the liberty\\n\\nguaranteed by Part III of the Constitution would cover within its\\n\\nprotective ambit not only due procedure and fairness but also access\\n\\nto justice and a speedy trial. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"136788839\\\" id=\\\"span_27\\\">In Supreme Court <a href=\\\"/doc/136788839/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Legal Aid\\n\\nCommittee Representing Undertrial Prisoners v.

Ideally, no person ought to suffer adverse consequences of his\\n\\nacts unless the same is established before a neutral arbiter. However,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_28\\\">12</span>\\n     (1994) 6 SCC 731, ¶ 15.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_31\\\">                                                                Page | 10\\n\\fowing to the practicalities of real life where to secure an effective trial\\n\\nand to ameliorate the risk to society in case a potential criminal is left\\n\\nat large pending trial, Courts are tasked with deciding whether an\\n\\nindividual ought to be released pending trial or not. Once it is obvious\\n\\nthat a timely trial would not be possible and the accused has suffered\\n\\nincarceration for a significant period of time, Courts would ordinarily\\n\\nbe obligated to enlarge them on bail.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_32\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"117627977\\\" id=\\\"span_29\\\">17.   As regard to the judgment in <a href=\\\"/doc/117627977/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">NIA v. Zahoor Ahmad Shah\\n\\nWatali</a> (supra), cited by learned ASG, we find that it dealt with an\\n\\nentirely different factual matrix. In that case, the High Court had re­\\n\\nappreciated the entire evidence on record to overturn the Special\\n\\nCourt’s conclusion of their being a prima facie case of conviction and\\n\\nconcomitant rejection of bail. The High Court had practically\\n\\nconducted a mini­trial and determined admissibility of certain\\n\\nevidences, which exceeded the limited scope of a bail petition. This not\\n\\nonly was beyond the statutory mandate of a prima facie assessment\\n\\nunder Section 43­D(5), but it was premature and possibly would have\\n\\nprejudiced the trial itself. It was in these circumstances that this\\n\\nCourt intervened and cancelled the bail.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_33\\\">18.   It is thus clear to us that the presence of statutory restrictions\\n\\nlike Section 43­D (5) of UAPA per­se does not oust the ability of\\n\\nConstitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of Part III of\\n\\n\\n                                                                 Page | 11\\n\\fthe Constitution. Indeed, both the restrictions under a Statue as well\\n\\nas the powers exercisable under Constitutional Jurisdiction can be\\n\\nwell harmonised. Whereas at commencement of proceedings, Courts\\n\\nare expected to appreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail\\n\\nbut the rigours of such provisions will melt down where there is no\\n\\nlikelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable time and the\\n\\nperiod of incarceration already undergone has exceeded a substantial\\n\\npart of the prescribed sentence. Such an approach would safeguard\\n\\nagainst the possibility of provisions like Section 43­D (5) of UAPA\\n\\nbeing used as the sole metric for denial of bail or for wholesale breach\\n\\nof constitutional right to speedy trial.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_34\\\">19.   Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of the fact that\\n\\nthe charges levelled against the respondent are grave and a serious\\n\\nthreat to societal harmony. Had it been a case at the threshold, we\\n\\nwould have outrightly turned down the respondent’s prayer. However,\\n\\nkeeping in mind the length of the period spent by him in custody and\\n\\nthe unlikelihood of the trial being completed anytime soon, the High\\n\\nCourt appears to have been left with no other option except to grant\\n\\nbail. An attempt has been made to strike a balance between the\\n\\nappellant’s right to lead evidence of its choice and establish the\\n\\ncharges beyond any doubt and simultaneously the respondent’s rights\\n\\nguaranteed under Part III of our Constitution have been well\\n\\n\\n                                                              Page | 12\\n\\fprotected.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_35\\\">20.   Yet    another   reason   which   persuades   us   to   enlarge   the\\n\\nRespondent on bail is that Section 43­D(5) of the UAPA is\\n\\ncomparatively less stringent than Section 37 of the NDPS. Unlike the\\n\\nNDPS where the competent Court needs to be satisfied that prima\\n\\nfacie the accused is not guilty and that he is unlikely to commit\\n\\nanother offence while on bail; there is no such pre­condition under the\\n\\nUAPA. Instead, Section 43­D (5) of UAPA merely provides another\\n\\npossible ground for the competent Court to refuse bail, in addition to\\n\\nthe well­settled considerations like gravity of the offence, possibility of\\n\\ntampering with evidence, influencing the witnesses or chance of the\\n\\naccused evading the trial by absconsion etc.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_36\\\">21.   In light of the above discussion, we are not inclined to interfere\\n\\nwith the impugned order. However, we feel that besides the conditions\\n\\nto be imposed by the trial Court while releasing the respondent, it\\n\\nwould serve the best interest of justice and the society­at­large to\\n\\nimpose some additional conditions that the respondent shall mark his\\n\\npresence every week on Monday at 10AM at the local police station\\n\\nand inform in writing that he is not involved in any other new crime.\\n\\nThe respondent shall also refrain from participating in any activity\\n\\nwhich might enrage communal sentiments. In case the respondent is\\n\\n\\n                                                                 Page | 13\\n\\ffound to have violated any of his bail conditions or attempted to have\\n\\ntampered the evidence, influence witnesses, or hamper the trial in any\\n\\nother way, then the Special Court shall be at liberty to cancel his bail\\n\\nforthwith. The appeal is accordingly dismissed subject to above­ stated\\n\\ndirections.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_37\\\">                                             ……………………………..
