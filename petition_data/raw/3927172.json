These appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated\\n30.03.2018 passed by a Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad\\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘the High Court’), The reference to Full Bench\\ncame to be made under the following circumstances: -\\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">1.1     Writ Petition No. 61449 of 2009, Smt. Madhuri Srivasatava Vs. State of\\nU.P. &amp; Ors.1 along with other connected petitions were filed by certain\\nlandholders whose land was acquired by NOIDA challenging the decision of the\\nBoard of Directors of NOIDA dated 07.01.1998 as also the approval granted to\\nthe said resolution by the State Government dated 02.03.2009 whereby a\\ndistinction was carved out in the matter of payment of compensation by creating\\na classification between “Pushtaini” and “Gair-pushtaini” landholders. The\\n‘Pushtaini’ landholders whose lands were acquired, were given additional\\ncompensation @ Rs.3 per sq. yard along with 15% as rehabilitation bonus on\\nthe compensation already awarded, as also the 10% area of the acquired land,\\nwhereas those who were declared as ‘Gair-pusht xcaini’ were denied this\\nadditional benefit. A Division Bench of the High Court vide Judgment and\\norder dated 10.05.2016 dismissed the Writ Petition holding the classification to\\nbe reasonable having direct nexus with the object sought to be achieved i.e.,\\nrehabilitation of the original residents who are likely to become landless due to\\nthe acquisition of their land.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">2.      Another bunch of Writ Petitions were filed by the present appellants\\nchallenging a similar classification made by the Greater Noida Authority\\n1     (2016) 6 SCC OnLine AII 2832\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">                                        2</span>\\n\\f(hereinafter referred to as ‘G Noida’) in payment of compensation on the basis\\nof the landholder being ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_3\\\">3.    While considering the Writ Petitions, another Division Bench disagreed\\nwith the views expressed in the case of Smt. Madhuri (Supra) and vide order\\ndated 07.07.2017 referred the matter to be decided by a larger Bench.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_4\\\">4.

Vide impugned judgment and order dated 30.03.2018, the Full Bench\\nanswered question No. 1 in negative and question No. 2 in affirmative and\\nupheld the view taken by the Division Bench in the case of Smt. Madhuri\\nSrivastava (Supra). As a consequence of the answers to the questions framed,\\n\\n\\n2 (1973) 1 SCC 500\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_3\\\">                                          3</span>\\n\\fthe Full Bench held that nothing remains to be decided in the Writ Petitions\\nfiled by the present appellants and the same were dismissed.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_3\\\">6. Before we enter into the factual matrix of the case, we find it expedient to\\nfirst trace out the etymology of the words “Pushtaini” and “Gair Pushtaini” used\\nin the impugned classification, for language, once adopted inside the realm of\\nlaw, materializes itself a much more powerful being, one which must be\\nunderstood in the right historical context.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\">7.      The word ‘Pushtaini’ is a Persian word and finds its origin from the word\\n‘Pusht’, which means ‘back’. The said word has been historically used in the\\ncontext of ancestry. Any possession, tale or legend, that has roots to a particular\\nancestry, to denote it’s significance to the said ancestry, the word ‘Pushtaini’ is\\nused.    As is obvious, since the word ‘Gair’ which finds its origin in Urdu\\nlanguage means ‘other than’, thus, ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ would mean one which is\\nnot ‘Pushtaini’.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">8.      What we find most interesting however, is that ancestry as a concept,\\nespecially before times of modern private property ownership, had remained to\\nbe a tool for inclusivity and not exclusion. In such a context, the use of the word\\n“Pushtaini” by the Authority, to exclude compensation might be a historically\\ninaccurate interpretation. While this is not consequential to the merits of the\\ncase, it is in our opinion a worthwhile observation, for law has to power to\\nlegitimize the meaning of words and can change the context in which a word\\nused, and in turn can change the course of history itself.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_4\\\">                                         4</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">\\fBackground Facts\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">9.    Since the early 1970s, Liberalization took over India by storm, and it\\nbrought with it the promise of massive economic growth. A huge amount of\\nmoney was infused in the Indian Economy with the purpose of developing\\nIndian cities into massive global hubs of capital and business. In line with this,\\nDelhi began its journey of becoming a global city. This influx of capital into the\\ncity also brought with it massive employment opportunities, and people from all\\nover the country started migrating to Delhi. To contain such influx of migrants\\nand ensure dignified living for all who came to the city with the hopes of\\nimproving their lives, the government of India planned to develop residential\\nand industrial areas around the capital. For this, Gurgaon was developed across\\nthe border of Haryana, and New Okhla Industrial Development Authority\\n(NOIDA) was developed by the Uttar Pradesh Government in the adjoining\\ndistrict of Gautam Budh Nagar. In this period, the city enjoyed massive growth,\\nboth in terms of influx of capital and migration. This growth was so\\nunprecedented, that it even exceeded the planning estimates as envisaged by the\\nauthorities. As a measure to accommodate such growth, the Uttar Pradesh\\nGovernment, exercising its powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/198567222/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section 3</a> of the U.P. Industrial Area\\nDevelopment Act, 1976, by notification dated 28.01.1991 created the township\\nof Greater Noida, in an area of 38000 hectare, comprising of 124 villages of\\nGautam Budh Nagar.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"452118\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">10.   For its planned development, the Respondent- G. Noida started\\nacquisition of land within its territorial area of operation under the provisions of\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as ‘1894 Act’). In the same\\nconnection, notifications dated 03.10.2005 and 05.01.2006 were issued under\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">                                         5</span>\\n\\f<a href=\\\"/doc/169774/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">Sections 4(1)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/466483/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Section 6(1)</a> of 1894 Act for acquisition of total area of\\n580.1734 hectares of the land for plan development situate in different villages\\nfalling within the jurisdiction of G. Noida. The said notifications, which also\\nincluded the land of the present appellants, were subject matter of challenge\\nbefore the High Court in a bunch of Writ Petitions challenging the acquisition\\nproceedings mainly on the ground of arbitrarily invoking urgency clause under\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/423817/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">Sections 17(1)</a> read with <a href=\\\"/doc/68773460/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">Section 17 (4)</a> of the 1894 Act. The bunch of the said\\nWrit Petitions came to be decided by the another Full Bench of the High Court\\ntitled as <a href=\\\"/doc/452118/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Gajraj Vs. State of U.P3</a>. The High Court concluded that the urgency\\nclause was wrongly invoked, but saved the acquisition for the reason that much\\ndevelopment had already taken place over the said land and the nature of land\\nstands completely changed. The Full Bench further in order to compensate the\\nlandholders directed an additional compensation to be paid to the landholders at\\nthe rate of 64.70% of the already paid compensation and a further direction was\\nissued to allot developed Abadi land to the extent of 10% of their acquired land,\\nsubject to a cap of Rs.2,500/- square meter. The Full Bench never made any\\ndistinction between ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ farmers for payment of the\\nadditional compensation or allotment of land.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1928044\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">The Full Bench also relying upon\\nthe decisions rendered in the case of Radheyshyam (Dead) through <a href=\\\"/doc/1928044/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">L.Rs &amp;\\nOrs.

Thus, two classes of landholders were carved out for\\npayment of compensation and those who were classified as ‘Pushtaini’\\nlandholders, a higher amount of compensation was decided to be awarded to\\nthem in the name of their rehabilitation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">13.

These rules prescribe for method of compensation\\n\\n         between the acquirer and the acquiree through an agreement.

It has been vehemently submitted on behalf of Greater Noida that the\\n\\nappellants herein did not exhaust their remedy under <a href=\\\"/doc/1517117/\\\" id=\\\"a_35\\\">Section 18</a> of the Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act and approach the High Court, and has sidestepped a procedural\\n\\nrequirement. <a href=\\\"/doc/1517117/\\\" id=\\\"a_36\\\">Section 18</a> of the 1894 Act reads as under :-\\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_31\\\">           “Reference to Court.- (1) Any person interested who has not\\n           accepted the award may, by written application to the\\n           Collector, require that the matter be referred by the Collector\\n           for the determination of the Court, whether his objection be\\n           to the measurement of the land, the amount of the\\n           compensation, the persons to whom it is payable, or the\\n           apportionment of the compensation among the persons\\n           interested.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_32\\\">           (2) The application shall state the grounds on which\\n           objection to the award is taken: Provided that every such\\n           application shall be made,\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_33\\\">           (a) if the person making it was present or represented before\\n           the Collector at the time when he made his award, within six\\n           weeks from the date of the Collector&#x27;s award;\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_34\\\">           (b) in other cases, within six weeks of the receipt of the\\n           notice from the Collector under <a href=\\\"/doc/948147/\\\" id=\\\"a_37\\\">section 12</a>, sub-section (2),\\n           or within six months from the date of the Collector&#x27;s award,\\n           whichever period shall first expire.”\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_31\\\">                                         24</span>\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_86\\\">\\f26.   The first and foremost thing to be taken note of is that the nature of the\\n\\nchallenge in the Writ Petition filed by the appellants before the High Court was\\n\\nbased on violation of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_38\\\">Article 14</a>, which is a fundamental right enshrined in the\\n\\nConstitution. Such a challenge, irrespective of the existence of any alternative\\n\\nremedy under a statute cannot put a bar on the jurisdiction of the Constitutional\\n\\nCourts.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_87\\\">27.   The Respondent Authority argued that             since the agreement was\\n\\nconsented to, no challenge could exist in the Court. This argument in the facts\\n\\nof the case, has been raised only to be rejected.          The issue involved in\\n\\nadjudication is not in respect of an agreement entered into by the appellants.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_88\\\">Similar agreements were also entered into with the Authority by such identically\\n\\nsituated landholders who have been granted additional compensation\\n\\nsubsequent to the agreement by carving out a distinction on the basis of period\\n\\nof residence/occupation of the land which was acquired by creating an artificial\\n\\nclassification of ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ landholders.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_89\\\">28.   Furthermore, since the issue of additional compensation by making an\\n\\nartificial classification of ‘pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-pushtani’ was not in existence at\\n\\nthe time of the agreement, there was no occasion to challenge the same.\\n</p>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_32\\\">                                        25</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_90\\\">\\f29.   Further, specifically in the context of the grant of ex-gratia payment, it is\\n\\nto be noted that the said payment granted to Pushtaini landowners through a\\n\\nseparate notification, was assessed, and given, after the agreement was signed\\n\\nby both, Pushtaini and Gair-pushtaini Landowners. The Appellants herein, under\\n\\nthose circumstances, could not have challenged the agreement vis a vis the ex-\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_91\\\">gratia payment on grounds of violation of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_39\\\">Article 14</a>, when no such violation\\n\\nexisted at the time of the agreement. No man can be expected to predict a future\\n\\nviolation of their rights and file a pre-emptive appeal. This Court is reminded of\\n\\nthe words of Francis Bacon, who in the 17 th century wrote about the link\\n\\nbetween legal certainty and justice:\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_35\\\">          “For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall\\n          prepare himself to the battle?

Let there be no authority to shed\\n          blood; nor let sentence be pronounced in any Court upon\\n          cases, except according to a known and certain law Nor\\n          should a man be deprived of his life, who did not first know\\n          that he was risking it.&#x27; (Quoted in Coquillette, Francis\\n          Bacon pp 244 and 248, from Aphorism 8 and Aphorism 39?\\n          A Treatise on Universal Justice).”\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_92\\\">30.   On the basis of the above-mentioned reasons, we are of the considered\\n\\nopinion that the Appellants, because of their signing of the agreement, have not\\n\\nforfeited their right to seek revised compensation, because ,the cause of action\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_33\\\">                                        26</span>\\n\\faccrued to them much after entering into the agreement.

The legislature and the\\n          administrative authority are, however, given an area of\\n          discretion or a range of choices but as to whether the choice\\n          made infringes the rights excessively or not is for the Court.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_122\\\">          That is what is meant by proportionality.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_123\\\">          29.The above principle of proportionality has been applied\\n          by the European Court to protect the rights guaranteed\\n          under the European Convention for the Protection of Human\\n          Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950 and in particular,\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_50\\\">                                         39</span>\\n\\ffor considering whether restrictions imposed were\\nrestrictions which were “necessary” — within <a href=\\\"/doc/691208/\\\" id=\\\"a_75\\\">Articles 8</a> to\\n11 of the said Convention [corresponding to our <a href=\\\"/doc/1142233/\\\" id=\\\"a_76\\\">Article\\n19(1)]</a> and to find out whether the restrictions imposed on\\nfundamental freedoms were more excessive than required.\\n(Handyside v.

On account of a Chapter on Fundamental Rights in Part\\nIII of our Constitution right from 1950, Indian Courts did\\nnot suffer from the disability similar to the one experienced\\nby English Courts for declaring as unconstitutional\\nlegislation on the principle of proportionality or reading\\nthem in a manner consistent with the charter of rights. Ever\\nsince 1950, the principle of “proportionality” has indeed\\nbeen applied vigorously to legislative (and administrative)\\naction in India. While dealing with the validity of legislation\\ninfringing fundamental freedoms enumerated in <a href=\\\"/doc/1142233/\\\" id=\\\"a_82\\\">Article\\n19(1)</a> of the Constitution of India — such as freedom of\\nspeech and expression, freedom to assemble peaceably,\\nfreedom to form associations and unions, freedom to move\\nfreely throughout the territory of India, freedom to reside\\nand settle in any part of India, — this Court has occasion to\\nconsider whether the restrictions imposed by legislation\\nwere disproportionate to the situation and were not the least\\nrestrictive of the choices. The burden of proof to show that\\nthe restriction was reasonable lay on the State. “Reasonable\\nrestrictions” under <a href=\\\"/doc/493243/\\\" id=\\\"a_83\\\">Articles 19(2)</a> to (6) could be imposed on\\nthese freedoms only by legislation and Courts had occasion\\nthroughout to consider the proportionality of the restrictions.\\nIn numerous judgments of this Court, the extent to which\\n“reasonable restrictions” could be imposed was considered.\\nIn Chintamanrao v. State of M.P. [1950 SCC 695 : AIR 1951\\nSC 118 : 1950 SCR 759] Mahajan, J. (as he then was)\\nobserved that “reasonable restrictions” which the State\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_51\\\">                              40</span>\\n\\fcould impose on the fundamental rights “should not be\\narbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required\\nin the interests of the public”.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_125\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"554839\\\" id=\\\"span_52\\\">31. “Reasonable” implied intelligent care and deliberations,\\nthat is, the choice of a course which reason dictated.\\nLegislation which arbitrarily or excessively invaded the\\nright could not be said to contain the quality of\\nreasonableness unless it struck a proper balance between\\nthe rights guaranteed and the control permissible under\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/493243/\\\" id=\\\"a_84\\\">Articles 19(2)</a> to (6). Otherwise, it must be held to be\\nwanting in that quality. Patanjali Sastri, C.J. in <a href=\\\"/doc/554839/\\\" id=\\\"a_85\\\">State of\\nMadras v. V.G.

So far as <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_87\\\">Article 14</a> is concerned, the Courts in India\\nexamined whether the classification was based on\\nintelligible differentia and whether the differentia had a\\nreasonable nexus with the object of the legislation.\\nObviously, when the Courts considered the question whether\\nthe classification was based on intelligible differentia, the\\nCourts were examining the validity of the differences and the\\nadequacy of the differences. This is again nothing but the\\nprinciple of proportionality. There are also cases where\\nlegislation or rules have been struck down as being\\narbitrary in the sense of being unreasonable [see <a href=\\\"/doc/1903603/\\\" id=\\\"a_88\\\">Air India v.\\nNergesh Meerza</a> [(1981) 4 SCC 335 : 1981 SCC (L&amp;S) 599]\\n(SCC at pp. 372-373)].</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1732220\\\" id=\\\"span_55\\\">But this latter aspect of striking\\ndown legislation only on the basis of “arbitrariness” has\\nbeen doubted in <a href=\\\"/doc/1732220/\\\" id=\\\"a_89\\\">State of A.P. v.

In Australia and Canada, the principle of proportionality\\nhas been applied to test the validity of statutes [see Cunliffe\\nv. Commonwealth [(1994) 58 Aust LJ 791] Aust LJ (at 827,\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_128\\\">839) (799, 810, 821)]. In R. v. Oakes [(1986) 26 DLR (4th)\\n200] Dickson, C.J. of the Canadian Supreme Court has\\nobserved that there are three important components of the\\nproportionality test. First, the measures adopted must be\\ncarefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They\\nmust not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational\\nconsiderations. In short, they must be rationally connected\\nto the objective. Secondly, the means, must not only be\\nrationally connected to the objective in the first sense, but\\nshould impair as little as possible the right to freedom in\\nquestion. Thirdly, there must be “proportionality” between\\nthe effects of the measures and the objective. See also Ross v.\\nBrunswick School Dishut No. 15 [(1996) 1 SCR 825] (SCR\\nat p. 872) referring to proportionality. English Courts had\\nno occasion to apply this principle to legislation. The\\naggrieved parties had to go to the European Court at\\nStrasbourg for a declaration.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_129\\\">34. In U.S.A., in City of Boerne v. Flores [(1997) 521 US\\n507] the principle of proportionality has been applied to\\nlegislation by stating that “there must be congruence and\\nproportionality between the injury to be prevented or\\nremedied and the means adopted to that end”.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_130\\\">35. Thus, the principle that legislation relating to\\nrestrictions on fundamental freedoms could be tested on the\\nanvil of “proportionality” has never been doubted in India.\\nThis is called “primary” review by the Courts of the validity\\nof legislation which offended fundamental freedoms.\\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_131\\\">45.

The Minister is then to move Parliament for\\nnecessary amendment to remove the incompatibility.

Further, it is also important to note that the classification, even if allowed\\n\\nto exist, does not come with any safeguards against its potential abuse. As\\n\\nmentioned above, the said notification by way of its classification creates\\n\\ndisastrous mischief, and the notification does nothing to remedy such potential\\n\\nabuse.

What is relevant\\n\\nto our case, is that the Court, while deciding this matter, held that the authority,\\n\\nwhile acquiring land, cannot distinguish between types of owners, as the object\\n\\nof achieving land for public purposes is met with, irrespective of the type of\\n\\nowner whose land is being acquired. The relevant paragraphs from the judgment\\n\\nreads as under:-</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_62\\\">          “It is now well-settled that the State can make a reasonable\\n          classification for the purpose of legislation. It is equally\\n          well-settled that the classification in order to be reasonable\\n          must satisfy two tests: (i) the classification must be founded\\n          on intelligible differentia and (ii) the differentia must have a\\n          rational relation with the object sought to be achieved by\\n          the legislation in question.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_63\\\">          In this connection it must be borne in mind that the object\\n          itself should be lawful. The object itself cannot be\\n          discriminatory, for otherwise, for instance, if the object is to\\n          discriminate against one section of the minority the\\n          discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that there\\n          is a reasonable classification because it has rational\\n          relation to the object sought to be achieved.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_64\\\">          What can be reasonable classification for the purpose of\\n          determining compensation if the object of the legislation is\\n          to compulsorily acquire land for public purposes?\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_65\\\">          It would not be disputed that different principles of\\n          compensation cannot be formulated for lands acquired on\\n          the basis that the owner is old or young, healthy or ill, tall\\n          or short, or whether the owner has inherited the property or\\n          built it with his own efforts, or whether the owner is\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_74\\\">                                         50</span>\\n\\f          politician or an advocate. Why is this sort of classification\\n          not sustainable? Because the object being to compulsorily\\n          acquire for a public purpose, the object is equally achieved\\n          whether the land belongs to one type of owner or another\\n          type.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_150\\\">59.   In our opinion, a bare reading of the abovementioned judgment makes it\\n\\namply clear that the classification made by the GNOIDA authority for the\\n\\npurposes of awarding differential compensation is bad in law, and it is precisely\\n\\nthis kind of classification that has been barred. When the purpose of the\\n\\nacquisition of the land is for the benefit of the public at large, then the nature of\\n\\nthe owner of the said land is inconsequential to the purpose. If such a\\n\\nclassification on the basis of the nature of owner is allowed, then on the same\\n\\ngrounds, there might be a possibility of future classifications where\\n\\npowerholding members of the society may get away with a larger\\n\\ncompensation, and the marginalized may get lesser compensation. This is\\n\\nprecisely what this Court in the abovementioned judgment predicted, and to pre-\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_151\\\">empt such arbitrary classification, clarified the position in law.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_152\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"337342\\\" id=\\\"span_75\\\">60.   <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_114\\\">The Land Acquisition Act</a> does not distinguish between classes of\\n\\nowners, and uniformly provides compensation to all class of landowners. The\\n\\nclassification made between Pushtaini landowners and Gair-pushtaini\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_76\\\">                                         51</span>\\n\\flandowners, on the basis of the reasoning mentioned above, is violative of the\\n\\nlaw <a href=\\\"/doc/337342/\\\" id=\\\"a_115\\\">laid down in</a> the <a href=\\\"/doc/337342/\\\" id=\\\"a_116\\\">Nagpur Trust</a> case (Supra) and <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_117\\\">Article 14</a> of the\\n\\nConstitution.</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_153\\\">Conclusion\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_154\\\">61.   In light of the above-mentioned reasoning, we are of the opinion that the\\n\\nclassification made by both the executive actions is bad in law, and is liable to\\n\\nbe set aside. <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_118\\\">The Land Acquisition Act</a> does not envisage any differential\\n\\ncompensation on the basis of such classification, and hence, this Court must\\n\\ninfer the compensation to be provided by the executive actions within the\\n\\nconfines of <a href=\\\"/doc/31609/\\\" id=\\\"a_119\\\">Section 23</a> of the Act.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_155\\\">62.   <a href=\\\"/doc/31609/\\\" id=\\\"a_120\\\">Section 23</a> of the Land Acquisition Act states out the grounds for granting\\n\\ncompensation in cases of acquisition of land under the Act. One such reason for\\n\\nthe grant of compensation is rehabilitation, and it is this need for granting\\n\\ncompensation for rehabilitation under the Act that is echoed by the impugned\\n\\nnotification. A bare reading of both the executive actions in consonance with\\n\\nthe Act would show that the need for giving compensation for rehabilitation is\\n\\nvalid in law and is backed by the parent statute. The mischief then, is only\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_77\\\">                                       52</span>\\n\\flimited to the arbitrary classification made by such actions. In such a case, we\\n\\nare of the opinion that since the mischief lies only within the classification, it\\n\\ncan be severed, and the remaining part of the executive actions that sets out to\\n\\ngrant compensation for the purpose of rehabilitation remains valid in law.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_156\\\">63.    Once the classification is removed, and the executive actions are read in\\n\\nconsonance with the parent act, we would see that since the Act, and now even\\n\\nthe executive actions do not discriminate in terms of compensation, the ex-\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_157\\\">gratia payment and the increased base amount, as enunciated by the executive\\n\\nactions, must be given to all landowners in the subject area.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_158\\\">64.   At this stage, we would like to state that while the objective of the said\\n\\nclassification might have been noble, however, such classification only on the\\n\\nbasis of conjectures and surmises cannot be sustained. If a claim is being made\\n\\nto differentiate between class of persons, such claim must be backed by\\n\\nempirical data. While this Court is not a fact-finding Court and is a Court of\\n\\nlaw, however, the law must also not be understood in isolation, but in the\\n\\ncontext in which it exists, as the law does not exist like an object within the\\n\\nstatutes, but lives and evolves with the people it governs.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_78\\\">                                        53</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_159\\\">\\f65.   Further, in cases of administrative action, even if the classification has a\\n\\nrational nexus to the objective of the notification, the classification must also be\\n\\nlegitimized by the parent statute. If the parent statute does not allow for a\\n\\nclassification, then, even if the classification vis-à-vis the notification is able to\\n\\npass the tests of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_121\\\">Article 14</a>, it would still be liable to struck down if the parent\\n\\nstatute does not allow for the same.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_160\\\">66.   The establishment of Greater Noida, as discussed above, was done for a\\n\\nnoble purpose, i.e., to accommodate in the city all those who came travelling\\n\\nfrom every corner of the country in search of a better life. While doing so\\n\\nhowever, as can be seen in the present case, some residents whose land was\\n\\nsubject to acquisition in the pursuit of the said aim, were faced with\\n\\ndiscrimination. In such circumstance, it becomes the duty of this Court to\\n\\ndispense justice, and rectify the harm caused to those at the receiving end of the\\n\\ndiscrimination.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_161\\\">67.
