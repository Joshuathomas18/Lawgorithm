The appellant before this Court is a training institute, run by\\n\\n          a registered society by the name of “Veena Vadini Samaj Kalyan\\n\\n          Vikash Samiti”. Inter-alia the institute trains teachers for B.Ed and\\n\\n          M.Ed courses. One of the courses, which is run by the appellant-\\n\\n          institute in Gwalior, State of Madhya Pradesh, is called B.Ed (Part\\n\\n          time), which is designed to impart B.Ed training to in service\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">Signature Not Verified</span>\\n\\n\\n          teachers.

Earlier the writ petition filed by the appellant challenging the\\n\\nGovernment policy dated 12.05.2022 was dismissed by the\\n\\nDivision Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, by order dated\\n\\n13.07.2022. The appellant as it appears, was seeking an\\n\\ninterference   from the    High Court in the       abovementioned\\n\\nGovernment policy, on the ground that it was violative of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Articles\\n\\n14</a><a href=\\\"/doc/609295/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">, 15</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/935769/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, as the government had\\n\\nmade 75% of the seats reserved for the residents of Madhya\\n\\nPradesh which is not permissible in law. The High Court, however,\\n\\nheld against the appellant and had dismissed the petition. While\\n\\ndoing so, it did not go into the details and disposed of the matter,\\n\\nin terms of the earlier Division Bench decision of the Madhya\\n\\nPradesh High Court in <a href=\\\"/doc/1768871/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Preston College and Another v. State of\\n\\nM.P. &amp; Ors.</a> 2007 SCC Online MP 103, which, inter alia, had held\\n\\nthat residential requirement in admission was not violative of the\\n\\nConstitution. We may add here that the challenge to the above\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">\\f                                                                   Page 3 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\n2007 decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court was made in an\\n\\nSLP (Civil) No. 5069 of 2007, before the court, which                    was\\n\\ndismissed as infructuous on 14.09.2018.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">4.   The appellant’s challenge to the above mentioned Policy dated\\n\\n12.05.2022 (called “Admission Process and Guiding Principles\\n\\n2022-2023”) is mainly on clause 1.5(a) of the policy, which\\n\\nallocates the B.Ed seats in the institute in the following manner:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">              “1.5     Division of seat numbers available in\\n              institutions\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">              (a) The division of seats for admission in\\n              courses like the courses regulated by the\\n              National Council for Teacher Education to be\\n              conducted in Madhya Pradesh, B.Ed.

The appellant-institute, has given before this Court the\\n\\nfigures of last two years, where although the entire 25 percent\\n\\nseats allocated to the “outside” candidates have been filled, but\\n\\nalmost all of the 75 percent of seats, reserved for the residents of\\n\\nMadhya Pradesh, have remained unfilled. These figures have not\\n\\nbeen denied by the State.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">     The figures are as follows:\\n</p>\\n<pre id=\\\"pre_2\\\">                                     Seats Available Seats    Seats\\n                                                     Filled   Vacant\\n       AY          M.P.

The Case of the appellant, therefore, is that 75% of the seats\\n\\nwhich have been reserved for permanent residents of Madhya\\n\\nPradesh, remain vacant due to the non-availability of residential\\n\\ncandidates and as such the appellant may be permitted to fill these\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_11\\\">\\f                                                              Page 5 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\nseats from outside candidates. This permission is, however, not\\n\\ngiven to the appellant.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">7.   There are two questions here; first is whether the State\\n\\nGovernment can reserve seats for “residents” of Madhya Pradesh\\n\\nand, then, in case if it is permissible; the second question would\\n\\nbe whether as large as 75% of the total seats, can be reserved for\\n\\nthe residents.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"434106\\\" id=\\\"span_12\\\">8.   As far as the first question is concerned, the same is no more\\n\\nres integra, as this Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">Dr. Pradeep Jain and\\n\\nOthers v. Union of India and Others</a> (1984) 3 SCC 654, had\\n\\nupheld such reservation.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1628\\\" id=\\\"span_13\\\">Even prior to Pradeep Jain, residence\\n\\nbased reservation was justified by this Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1628/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">D.P.\\n\\nJoshi v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (1955) 1 SCR 1215, but it is\\n\\nonly in Pradeep Jain where an elaborate discussion on this aspect\\n\\nwas done and such reservation were held to be valid. This\\n\\ndeparture from the Rule of selection based on merit was justified\\n\\non two grounds. Firstly, what one may call as the State interest,\\n\\nwhich would mean the expenditure incurred by the State in\\n\\ncreating the educational infrastructure and the cost of its\\n\\nmaintenance      and   the   second   was   the   State’s   claims     to\\n\\nbackwardness (Pradeep Jain Para 14). We must add that\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_14\\\">\\f                                                            Page 6 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\ninstitutional and residential requirements were further held to be\\n\\npermissible in the case of Saurabh Chaudhari and Others.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"434106\\\" id=\\\"span_15\\\">v.\\n\\nUnion of India and Others reported in (2003) 11 SCC 146 which\\n\\nfollowed the <a href=\\\"/doc/1628/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">ratio <a href=\\\"/doc/1628/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">laid down in</a></a> <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Pradeep Jain</a> (supra).</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"434106\\\" id=\\\"span_16\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"132022363\\\" id=\\\"span_17\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"725077\\\" id=\\\"span_18\\\">Further, this\\n\\nCourt in <a href=\\\"/doc/725077/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Magan Mehrotra and Others v.

As far as “State interest” was concerned it was an admitted\\n\\nfact that it was the State which contributed in the establishment\\n\\nand upkeep of the medical institutions, which required a\\n\\nconsiderable amount of financial support and if the State has to\\n\\nspend money on these institutions, it is not unreasonable that the\\n\\nState should ensure at least some of its benefits to flow exclusively\\n\\nfor its residents.   It was for this reason that the different fee\\n\\nstructure, one from the residents of Madhya Bharat, and other\\n\\nfrom the students who belong to other States was justified as a\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_19\\\">\\f                                                                      Page 7 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\nreasonable classification in D.P.

But then we must also remember that in Pradeep Jain as\\n\\nwell as in the subsequent such cases <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">referred above</a> this Court\\n\\nwere dealing with medical education in India, and the legality of\\n\\n‘residence requirement’ or reservations based on residence, in\\n\\nMBBS as well as Post Graduate Courses in medical education! The\\n\\nvalidity of residence requirement was upheld in Pradeep Jain,\\n\\nfollowed by a catena of decisions of Supreme Court, which also\\n\\ntook into account economic factors as well as backwardness of the\\n\\nregion while allowing reservation for permanent residents of the\\n\\nState, in medical education. We should not lose sight of this vital\\n\\nfact when we are dealing with the reservations based on residence\\n\\nin other fields of education, as we are doing presently.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"434106\\\" id=\\\"span_28\\\"><a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Whether the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_29\\\">4</span>\\n    Para 19, Page 686 of Pradeep Jain</a> (Supra).</span>\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_30\\\">\\f                                                             Page 9 of 14</span><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_18\\\">\\n\\n\\njustifiable factors of ‘State interest’ and the claim for backwardness\\n\\nof the State or any other factors which were relevant factors for\\n\\nresidence reservations in medical education, would be equally\\n\\nrelevant in other fields of education or other professional courses\\n\\nis still to be determined.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\">11.   The determination made in Pradeep Jain by this Court also\\n\\ngoes 40 years back in history. This determination was made in\\n\\n1984, when the social and economic conditions of the country and\\n\\nof the specific regions in question, weighed heavily in the minds of\\n\\nthe learned Judges, which is reflected in passages after passages\\n\\nin Pradeep Jain. So is also the state of medical education in the\\n\\ncountry as it existed at that time. Yet, over the last 40 years, there\\n\\nhas been a change in our medical education, which has seen a\\n\\ngrowth, at least in the number of such medical colleges which have\\n\\ncome up, both in private and government sector. Similarly, there\\n\\nis a change in our social and economic condition as well. In any\\n\\ncase, the conditions as it exists today is not the same, as was there\\n\\n40 years earlier, when a decision in Pradeep Jain was taken.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\">12. In the case at hand, we are not dealing with medical\\n\\neducation, but with the validity of reservation based on residence\\n\\nrequirement in a professional education course i.e. B.Ed. In our\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_31\\\">\\f                                                          Page 10 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\nconsidered opinion, the ratio as     <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">laid down by</a> this Court in\\n\\nPradeep Jain would be applicable in this case as well but only to\\n\\nan extent, not fully. The reasons as we have already indicated are\\n\\ntwo: firstly Pradeep Jain and all the cases which follow Pradeep\\n\\nJain deal only with medical education, and secondly the ratio as\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">laid down in</a> Pradeep Jain has also to be seen in the context of the\\n\\ntime when it was delivered. In short, therefore, though we have to\\n\\nfollow the principles as <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">laid down in</a> Pradeep Jain but at the same\\n\\ntime we also have to keep in mind the ground realities of the\\n\\npresent day. We also have to keep in mind that we are presently\\n\\nnot dealing with medical education but admission in a professional\\n\\neducation course called B.Ed.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_21\\\">13. This Court while upholding such reservations in medical\\n\\neducation had considered factors such as huge investments the\\n\\nState had made in creating the infrastructure, the backwardness\\n\\nof the area, the presumption that the local residents after gaining\\n\\nthe education will serve the people of that State, etc. All these\\n\\nfactors may or may not be equally relevant while we are\\n\\nconsidering admission to other courses such as B.Ed in the\\n\\npresent case.\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_32\\\">\\f                                                                    Page 11 of 14</span><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_22\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_23\\\">14. What is equally important is that it was in Pradeep Jain\\n\\nagain that this Court had cautioned against largescale reservation\\n\\nunder this head i.e. residents of the State. It cautioned against\\n\\nsuch largescale reservation calling it as “wholesale” reservations.\\n\\nPara 20 of this Judgment would be relevant:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_8\\\">         “20. …We agree wholly with these observations made by\\n         the learned Judge and we unreservedly condemn\\n         wholesale reservation made by some of the State\\n         Governments on the basis of “domicile” or residence\\n         requirement within the State or on the basis of\\n         institutional preference for students who have passed\\n         the qualifying examination held by the university or the\\n         State excluding all students not satisfying this\\n         requirement, regardless of merit. We declare such\\n         wholesale reservation to be unconstitutional and void as\\n         being in violation of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_24\\\">15. At this juncture, before we advert to the merits of the extent\\n\\nof reservation in the present case, it would be prudent to examine\\n\\nsome observations made by this Court. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"434106\\\" id=\\\"span_33\\\">In the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">Pradeep\\n\\nJain</a> (supra.), this Court had expressed its opinion on the\\n\\npermissible extent of reservations based on residence. It was held\\n\\nthat residence based reservation should not exceed 70 percent. The\\n\\nobservations relevant for our consideration are as follows:</span>\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_9\\\">            “21. …So many variables depending on social\\n            and economic facts in the context of educational\\n            opportunities would enter into the determination\\n            of the question as to what in the case of any\\n            particular State, should be the limit of\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_34\\\">\\f                                                                 Page 12 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\n            reservation based on residence requirement\\n            within the State or on institutional preference.\\n            But in our opinion, such reservation should in\\n            no event exceed the outer limit of 70 per cent of\\n            the total number of open seats after taking into\\n            account other kinds of reservations validly made.\\n            The Medical Education Review Committee has\\n            suggested that the outer limit should not exceed\\n            75 percent but we are of the view that it would\\n            be fair and just to fix the outer limit at 70 per\\n            cent. We are laying down this outer limit of\\n            reservation in an attempt to reconcile the\\n            apparently conflicting claims of equality and\\n            excellence. We may make it clear that this outer\\n            limit fixed by us will be subject to any reduction\\n            or attenuation which may be made by the Indian\\n            Medical Council which is the statutory body of\\n            medical      practitioners    whose     functional\\n            obligations include setting standards for medical\\n            education and providing for its regulation and\\n            coordination…”\\n\\n\\n\\n     Although, the State Government is within its right to reserve\\n\\nseats in educational institutions for its permanent residents, yet\\n\\nthe only question remains as to the extent of this reservation.\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_25\\\">16. In order to appreciate the facts of this case, we have been\\n\\nshown the data of the last 2 preceding years i.e., 2021-2022 and\\n\\n2022-2023, and the appellant has tried to impress upon this court\\n\\nthat almost all the seats which were reserved for the residents of\\n\\nMadhya Pradesh have remained vacant in the last two years. For\\n\\ninstance, in the year 2021-2022, only 4 seats out of 75 reserved\\n\\nseats for the resident of Madhya Pradesh had been filled and in the\\n\\nyear 2022-2023, only 2 seats out of 75 reserved seats had been\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_35\\\">\\f                                                           Page 13 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\nfilled, and thus 71 and 73 seats, respectively remained vacant for\\n\\nthe last two years.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_26\\\">17. Thus, it is apparent that the large percentage of seats\\n\\nreserved for the residents of Madhya Pradesh which remains\\n\\nunfilled is not serving any purpose. Moreover, a wholesale\\n\\nreservation for residents of Madhya Pradesh would also be violative\\n\\nof the law <a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_25\\\">laid down in</a> the case of Pradeep Jain, as we have\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/434106/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">referred above</a> in this order.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">18. Since the academic session for the year 2022-23 has already\\n\\ncommenced, we would refrain from interfering in the matter but\\n\\nwe direct the State of Madhya Pradesh to reappreciate this entire\\n\\naspect, in the light of what we have said above. Though the State\\n\\nis within its right to reserve seats for its own residents, but while\\n\\ndoing so, it must keep the ground realities in mind. Keeping 75%\\n\\nof the seats reserved for the residents of Madhya Pradesh is too\\n\\nhigh a percentage, and as the figures for the last two years\\n\\nindicate, it is also not serving any purpose. The number of seats\\n\\nfrom the next academic year shall, therefore be fixed again for\\n\\nresidents and non-residents, keeping the observations made by us\\n\\nin this order. We make it clear that though reservation in favour\\n\\nof residents is permissible, yet reservation to the extent of 75% of\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_36\\\">\\f                                                          Page 14 of 14</span>\\n\\n\\nthe total seats makes it a wholesale reservation, which has been\\n\\nheld in Pradeep Jain to be unconstitutional and violative of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_27\\\">Article\\n\\n14</a> of the Constitution of India5.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_28\\\">19. The State Government may examine the data of last few\\n\\nyears, in order to come to a realistic finding as to what should be\\n\\nthe extent of these reservations. A wholesale reservation as we\\n\\nhave seen is not serving any purpose rather it frustrates the very\\n\\npurpose of the reservation.
