The first respondent, who was awarded the Work\\n\\nOrder, entered into a sub-contract with the appellant.\\n</blockquote>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_11\\\">                          3</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">\\fClause 10 of the Work Order, constituting the sub-\\n\\ncontract,    provided     for   an     Arbitration     Clause.    The\\n\\nappellant had furnished a bank guarantee in terms of\\n\\nClause 9. The invocation of the said guarantee led to\\n\\na Suit by the appellant against the encashment of the\\n\\nbank guarantee. The first respondent applied under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1146817/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Section 8</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\\n\\n(hereinafter referred to as, ‘the Act’, for short)\\n\\nseeking Reference. A Writ Petition was filed by the\\n\\nfirst     respondent     challenging       the    Order     of     the\\n\\nCommercial    Court      rejecting      the    Application       under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/178250841/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Section 8</a> of the Act. One of the contentions raised was\\n\\nthat the Arbitration Agreement became unenforceable as\\n\\nthe Work Order was unstamped. The High Court, however,\\n\\nallowed     the   Writ    Petition       filed    by    the      first\\n\\nrespondent. The issue relevant to this                  Bench     was,\\n\\nwhether the Arbitration Agreement would be enforceable\\n\\nand acted upon, even if the Work Order is unstamped and\\n\\nunenforceable     under     the       <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Indian   Stamp    Act,     1899</a>\\n\\n(hereinafter referred to as, ‘the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Stamp                   Act</a>’, for\\n\\nshort).\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_12\\\">                                  4</span>\\n\\fC.

The Court found that an Arbitration Agreement is a\\n\\ndistinct and separate agreement, which is independent\\n\\nfrom the substantive commercial contract in which it\\n\\nis embedded. Under the Doctrine of Kompetenz–Kompetenz,\\n\\nthe Arbitral Tribunal had competence to rule on its own\\n\\njurisdiction, including objections with regard to the\\n\\nexistence,       validity    and   scope    of   the   Arbitration\\n\\nAgreement. <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Section 16(1)</a> of the Act was relied upon.\\n\\nThe Court made a copious reference to case law in\\n\\nsupport of the Doctrine of Kompetenz-Kompetenz. <a href=\\\"/doc/24401139/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Section\\n\\n5</a>    of    the     Act      contemplated     minimal     judicial\\n\\ninterference. The Court referred to the <a href=\\\"/doc/140940389/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Maharashtra\\n\\nStamp     Act,    1958</a>.     <a href=\\\"/doc/154608408/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Section    34</a>   of   the   said   Act,\\n\\nessentially, is pari materia with <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Section 35</a> of the\\n\\nStamp Act, 1899 hereinafter referred to as the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Stamp\\n\\nAct</a>. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_13\\\">There are other provisions, which essentially\\n\\nfollow the same pattern as is contained in the latter\\n\\nAct.

It was found that\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Stamp Act</a> is a fiscal measure. Thereafter, the\\n\\nCourt went on to discuss the Judgment of this Court\\n\\nreported    in     <a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">SMS   Tea   Estates   Private     Limited   v.\\n\\nChandmari    Tea    Company    Private   Limited2</a>.</span>    <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_15\\\">The   Court\\n\\nreferred to the following part of the Judgment in <a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">SMS\\n\\nTea Estates</a> (supra):</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_4\\\">       “19.

Therefore, when a lease deed or any other\\n       instrument is relied upon as contending the\\n       arbitration   agreement,  the   court  should\\n       consider at the outset, whether an objection\\n       in that behalf is raised or not, whether the\\n       document is properly stamped. If it comes to\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_16\\\">2</span>\\n    (2011) 14 SCC 66\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_17\\\">                                6</span>\\n\\f       the conclusion that it is not properly stamped,\\n       it should be impounded and dealt with in the\\n       manner specified in <a href=\\\"/doc/103830943/\\\" id=\\\"a_28\\\">Section 38</a> of the Stamp\\n       Act. The court cannot act upon such a document\\n       or the arbitration clause therein.

The Court further went on to find that, at the time\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_31\\\">SMS Tea Estates</a> (supra) was decided, the law relating\\n\\nto reference to Arbitration under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_32\\\">Section 11</a> of the\\n\\nAct, was expounded in the Constitution Bench decision\\n\\nreported in SBP &amp; Co. v.

Prima\\n     facie, it would be difficult to say that in\\n     spite of the finality conferred by sub-section\\n     (7) of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_199\\\">Section 11</a> of the Act, to such a decision\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_110\\\">                          33</span>\\n\\f     of the Chief Justice, the Arbitral Tribunal can\\n     still go behind that decision and rule on its\\n     own jurisdiction or on the existence of an\\n     arbitration clause. It also appears to us to\\n     be incongruous to say that after the Chief\\n     Justice had appointed an Arbitral Tribunal, the\\n     Arbitral Tribunal can turn round and say that\\n     the Chief Justice had no jurisdiction or\\n     authority to appoint the Tribunal, the very\\n     creature brought into existence by the exercise\\n     of power by its creator, the Chief Justice. The\\n     argument of the learned Senior Counsel, Mr K.K.\\n     Venugopal that <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_200\\\">Section 16</a> has full play only\\n     when an Arbitral Tribunal is constituted\\n     without intervention under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_201\\\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\\n     Act, is one way of reconciling that provision\\n     with <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_202\\\">Section 11</a> of the Act, especially in the\\n     context of sub-section (7) thereof. We are\\n     inclined to the view that the decision of the\\n     Chief Justice on the issue of jurisdiction and\\n     the existence of a valid arbitration agreement\\n     would be binding on the parties when the matter\\n     goes to the Arbitral Tribunal and at subsequent\\n     stages of the proceeding except in an appeal\\n     in the Supreme Court in the case of the\\n     decision being by the Chief Justice of the High\\n     Court or by a Judge of the High Court\\n     designated by him.”\\n                                (Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_39\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_111\\\">27.

On jurisprudentially and textualism it\\n        is possible to differentiate between existence\\n        of an arbitration agreement and validity of an\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_154\\\">                                    48</span>\\n\\farbitration agreement. Such interpretation can\\ndraw support from the plain meaning of the word\\n“existence”. However, it is equally possible,\\njurisprudentially and on contextualism, to\\nhold that an agreement has no existence if it\\nis not enforceable and not binding. Existence\\nof an arbitration agreement presupposes a valid\\nagreement which would be enforced by the court\\nby relegating the parties to arbitration.\\nLegalistic and plain meaning interpretation\\nwould be contrary to the contextual background\\nincluding the definition clause and would\\nresult    in    unpalatable    consequences.   A\\nreasonable     and   just    interpretation   of\\n“existence”     requires    understanding    the\\ncontext, the purpose and the relevant legal\\nnorms applicable for a binding and enforceable\\narbitration agreement. An agreement evidenced\\nin writing has no meaning unless the parties\\ncan be compelled to adhere and abide by the\\nterms. A party cannot sue and claim rights\\nbased on an unenforceable document. Thus, there\\nare good reasons to hold that an arbitration\\nagreement exists only when it is valid and\\nlegal. A void and unenforceable understanding\\nis no agreement to do anything.

A right to rescind for misrepresentation\\ncan be lost in a variety of ways, some\\ndepending on the right of election. A\\nrepresentee on discovering the truth loses his\\nright to rescind if once he has elected not to\\nrescind. But he may lose even before he has\\nmade any election where by reason of his\\nconduct or other circumstances it would be\\nunjust or inequitable that he retains the\\nright. For instance, where third parties have\\nacquired rights under the contract; again where\\nit would be unjust to the representor because\\nit is impossible to restore him to his original\\nposition. Restitutio in integrum is not only a\\nconsequence of rescission, its possibility is\\nindispensable to the right to rescind. Again,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_190\\\">                     68</span>\\n\\f     delay in election may make it unjust that the\\n     right to elect should continue.

The said vitiating factor also, does\\n\\nnot result in a void agreement but a voidable contract.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/144041300/\\\" id=\\\"a_393\\\">Section 14</a>, defining ‘free consent’, provides that\\n\\nconsent is said to be free, when it is not caused by\\n\\nmistake, subject to the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/129381123/\\\" id=\\\"a_394\\\">Sections 20</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/35509880/\\\" id=\\\"a_395\\\">21</a>\\n\\nand <a href=\\\"/doc/34298480/\\\" id=\\\"a_396\\\">22</a>, after referring to the other four aspects,\\n\\nwhich detract from free consent. We notice what <a href=\\\"/doc/129381123/\\\" id=\\\"a_397\\\">Section\\n\\n20</a> provides. <a href=\\\"/doc/129381123/\\\" id=\\\"a_398\\\">Section 20</a> declares that where both the\\n\\nparties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a\\n\\nmatter   of   fact   essential   to   the   agreement,   the\\n\\nagreement is void. We may observe that this again is a\\n\\ncase of an agreement, which is declared void within the\\n\\nmeaning of <a href=\\\"/doc/187309000/\\\" id=\\\"a_399\\\">Section 10</a>, apart from <a href=\\\"/doc/65414415/\\\" id=\\\"a_400\\\">Sections 24</a> to <a href=\\\"/doc/187563072/\\\" id=\\\"a_401\\\">30</a>.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/35509880/\\\" id=\\\"a_402\\\">Section 21</a> provides that a mistake as to any law in\\n\\nforce in India, would not make the contract voidable.\\n\\nThus, while <a href=\\\"/doc/187309000/\\\" id=\\\"a_403\\\">Section 10</a> sets out the core element for\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_191\\\">                            69</span>\\n\\fan agreement to become a contract, the effect of non-\\n\\nconformity varies.   Therefore, the lack of competency\\n\\nand absence of sound mind completely detract from the\\n\\nformation of a ‘contract’.    The absence of free consent\\n\\narising    from      coercion,      undue     influence,\\n\\nmisrepresentation and even fraud will, however, result\\n\\nin an agreement which is a ‘contract’ though voidable\\n\\n(see <a href=\\\"/doc/353998/\\\" id=\\\"a_404\\\">Sections 19</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1045643/\\\" id=\\\"a_405\\\">19A</a> of the Contract Act).        The\\n\\neffect of mistake, is again spelt out in <a href=\\\"/doc/34298480/\\\" id=\\\"a_406\\\">Section 22</a>,\\n\\ninsofar as it provides that a contract is not voidable\\n\\nmerely because one of the parties consented to the\\n\\ncontract, labouring under a mistake as to a matter of\\n\\nfact. <a href=\\\"/doc/141495712/\\\" id=\\\"a_407\\\">Section 37</a> comes under Chapter IV which deals\\n\\nwith performance of contracts and of contracts which\\n\\nmust be performed. <a href=\\\"/doc/141495712/\\\" id=\\\"a_408\\\">Section 37</a> reads:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_111\\\">     “37.

It is important to juxtapose the\\n\\nembargo    cast     on    an       unstamped     document   as\\n\\naforesaid with <a href=\\\"/doc/1890444/\\\" id=\\\"a_445\\\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Contract\\n\\nAct. <a href=\\\"/doc/1890444/\\\" id=\\\"a_446\\\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Contract Act provides\\n\\nthat an agreement, which is enforceable in law\\n\\nis   a    contract       whereas         <a href=\\\"/doc/30073236/\\\" id=\\\"a_447\\\">Section    2(g)</a>,   an\\n\\nagreement not enforceable is void.

The     unstamped       or\\n\\ninsufficiently stamped document cannot be used\\n\\nas   evidence     for        any    purpose.      It     would    be\\n\\ninconceivable, as to how, it could be in the\\n\\nsame    breath,        be     found      that     an    unstamped\\n\\ndocument is yet enforceable in law or that it\\n\\nis not enforceable in law.                      It is another\\n\\nmatter that the parties may act upon it.

However, even in the categories of void\\n\\ncontracts as for instance, <a href=\\\"/doc/483593/\\\" id=\\\"a_510\\\">Section 20</a> of the Contract\\n\\nAct provides that if on a material point, the parties\\n\\nwere mistaken, the contract would be void.

When an Arbitration Agreement is sought to\\n\\nbe brought under the cloud on the basis that it is a\\n\\nvoidable contract which has been avoided, again it may\\n\\nbe a matter where the principle of Kompetenz-Kompetenz\\n\\nmay be apposite and again the court under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_512\\\">Section 11</a>\\n\\nwould be justified in proceeding on the basis that an\\n\\narbitration      agreement    exists.      The    question     must\\n\\nundoubtedly      be   approached    from   the    standpoint     of\\n\\nadvancing the sublime cause of speedy commencement,\\n\\nprogress and conclusion of arbitration. When Parliament\\n\\nintervened by amending the Act, while in <a href=\\\"/doc/178250841/\\\" id=\\\"a_513\\\">Section 8</a>, it\\n\\nhas employed the words prima facie, it has used the\\n\\nword ‘examine’ to ascertain about the existence of an\\n\\narbitration agreement in <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_514\\\">Section 11 (6A)</a>.

Can it be said that an\\n\\ninvalid agreement can be said to exist in law for the\\n\\npurpose of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_517\\\">Section 11(6A)</a>?\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_150\\\">73. What is an invalid document or agreement? It is an\\nexpression which is associated and often conflated with\\n\\nthe word void. We have already noticed <a href=\\\"/doc/129381123/\\\" id=\\\"a_518\\\">Section 20</a> as\\n\\nan instance where a common mistake of the parties on a\\n\\nmaterial subject renders the agreement void.

This   would\\n\\nequally be the case where it is found that one of the\\n\\nparties was a minor.

The question would arise as follows:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_145\\\">i.     A document containing the Arbitration Clause may\\n\\n       not bear any stamp duty. We have already found that\\n\\n       even an Arbitration Agreement, on its own, may be\\n\\n       required to be stamped, as submitted by the learned\\n\\n       Amicus. But then the Court can proceed on the basis\\n\\n       that        the     amount    of        stamp        duty,    which    the\\n\\n       Arbitration Agreement contained in an Arbitration\\n\\n       Clause,       would     be    exigible          to    being     extremely\\n\\n       meagre, there is very little likelihood of such an\\n\\n       agreement not being stamped. Therefore, what the\\n\\n       Court is to consider is, whether when the contract,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_329\\\">                                         126</span>\\n\\f      in which the Arbitration Clause is contained, is\\n\\n      not duly stamped, it becomes the duty of the Court\\n\\n      to act under <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_744\\\">Sections 33</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_745\\\">35</a> of the Stamp Act.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_146\\\">ii.   We     have     already      indicated      the   background,\\n\\n      consisting of the views expressed by this Court,\\n\\n      about the nature of review undertaken under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_746\\\">Section\\n\\n      11</a>, which led to the insertion of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_747\\\">Section 11(6A)</a>.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_147\\\">      <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_330\\\">Parliament clearly intended to deal with the Court\\n\\n      undertaking excessive review, in exercise of the\\n\\n      power under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_748\\\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act. It was to\\n\\n      curtail excessive judicial interference, which was\\n\\n      in keeping also with the principle enshrined in\\n\\n      <a href=\\\"/doc/24401139/\\\" id=\\\"a_749\\\">Section 5</a> of the Act that Parliament interfered\\n\\n      and enacted the amendment resulting in <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_750\\\">Section\\n\\n      11(6A)</a> being inserted. Parliament was aware of the\\n\\n      view    taken    by   this     Court   in   <a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_751\\\">SMS   Tea    Estates</a>\\n\\n      (supra), namely that, if the Arbitration Agreement\\n\\n      was not duly stamped, then, it had to be impounded\\n\\n      and dealt with as provided therein. The mandate of\\n\\n      the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_752\\\">Stamp Act</a> did not conflict with the legislative\\n\\n      command       contained   in    <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_753\\\">Section     11(6A)</a>,     viz.,   to\\n\\n      examine whether an Arbitration Agreement existed.</span>\\n</blockquote>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_331\\\">                                   127</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_205\\\">\\f       Proceeding on the basis, in fact, that a contract,\\n\\n       containing the Arbitration Agreement, which is not\\n\\n       duly stamped, could be said to exist in law, it\\n\\n       would still not dislodge the duty cast on the Court\\n\\n       under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_754\\\">Section 11</a> to follow the mandate of <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_755\\\">Sections\\n\\n       33</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_756\\\">35</a> of the Stamp Act. In other words, on the\\n\\n       aforesaid    view,       following   the   command    under\\n\\n       <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_757\\\">Section 11(6A)</a>, could not detract from, the Court\\n\\n       also   at   the   same    time,   following   the    equally\\n\\n       binding mandate contained in the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_758\\\">Stamp Act</a>.\\n\\niii.   The question further arises, as to whether, in view\\n\\n       of the power of the Court under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_759\\\">Section 11</a>, to find\\n\\n       only prima facie, the existence of the Arbitration\\n\\n       Agreement, it would enable the Court to make a\\n\\n       Reference and appointment and relegate the issue\\n\\n       of impounding of the document to the Arbitrator.\\n\\niv.    Any shirking of the statutory duty by the Court\\n\\n       under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_760\\\">Section 11</a> to act in tune with the peremptory\\n\\n       statutory dictate of the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_761\\\">Stamp Act</a>, appears to us\\n\\n       unjustifiable. Such abdication of its plain duty\\n\\n       is neither contemplated by the Law-Giver nor would\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_332\\\">                                  128</span>\\n\\f     it be justifiable as causing the breach of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_762\\\">Section\\n\\n     11(6A)</a>.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_206\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_333\\\">v.   The view that cases under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_763\\\">Section 11</a> of the Act\\n\\n     would consume more time and hinder the timely\\n\\n     progress of arbitration and that the matter must\\n\\n     be postponed so that the Arbitrator will more\\n\\n     suitably deal with it, does not appeal to us. <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_764\\\">While\\n\\n     the Stamp Act</a> is primarily intended to collect\\n\\n     revenue and it is not intended to arm a litigant\\n\\n     to   raise     ‘technical      pleas’,     this    would   hardly\\n\\n     furnish justification for the Court to ignore the\\n\\n     voice of the Legislature couched in unambiguous\\n\\n     terms. We find that the view expressed in <a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_765\\\">SMS Tea\\n\\n     Estates</a>    (supra),      being    reiterated,       despite   the\\n\\n     insertion of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_766\\\">Section 11(6A)</a>, would promote the\\n\\n     object of the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_767\\\">Stamp Act</a> and yet be reconcilable\\n\\n     with    the    mandate    of     <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_768\\\">Section    11(6A)</a>.    We     may,\\n\\n     however, qualify what we have said with a caveat.\\n\\n     There may be cases, where no stamp duty is seen\\n\\n     paid.     It   paves     the    way   for    the    unambiguous\\n\\n     discharge of duty under <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_769\\\">Sections 33</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_770\\\">35</a> of the\\n\\n     Stamp Act. There may, however, be cases, where it\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_334\\\">                                 129</span>\\n\\f      may be stamped but the objection is taken by the\\n\\n      party that it is not duly stamped. In such cases,\\n\\n      no doubt, it is ordinarily the duty of the Court\\n\\n      to examine the matter with reference to the duty\\n\\n      under    <a href=\\\"/doc/6062133/\\\" id=\\\"a_771\\\">Section      33(2)</a>.    If   the   claim    that it    is\\n\\n      insufficiently stamped, appears to the Court to be\\n\\n      on the face of it, wholly without foundation, it\\n\\n      may    make    the     Reference     on    the   basis   of   the\\n\\n      existence of an Arbitration Agreement otherwise\\n\\n      and    then    leave    it    open   to    the   Arbitrator    to\\n\\n      exercise the power under <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_772\\\">Section 33</a>, should it\\n\\n      become necessary.            This approach does justice to\\n\\n      the word ‘examine’ in <a href=\\\"/doc/6062133/\\\" id=\\\"a_773\\\">Section 33(2)</a> of the Stamp\\n\\n      Act while not ignoring the command of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_774\\\">Section\\n\\n      11(6A)</a> of the Act.           It is not to be confused with\\n\\n      the     duty   to    examine     prima     facie    whether    an\\n\\n      ‘Arbitration         Agreement’      exists      under   <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_775\\\">Section\\n\\n      11(6A)</a> of the Act, but is related to the duty to\\n\\n      examine the matter under <a href=\\\"/doc/6062133/\\\" id=\\\"a_776\\\">Section 33(2)</a> of the Stamp\\n\\n      Act.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_207\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_335\\\">vi.   <a href=\\\"/doc/1953529/\\\" id=\\\"a_777\\\">Under the Evidence Act</a>, production of only the\\n\\n      original document is permissible by way of evidence\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_336\\\">                                    130</span>\\n\\f(See <a href=\\\"/doc/117475092/\\\" id=\\\"a_778\\\">Section 62</a>).

Equally, <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_791\\\">Section 16(1)(b)</a> declares\\n\\n       that despite the Tribunal finding that the contract\\n\\n       was null and void, it would not invalidate the\\n\\n       Arbitration Clause. The evolution of the principle\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_340\\\">                                    133</span>\\n\\fthat an Arbitration Agreement is a separate and\\n\\ndistinct       agreement   from    the     contract,       would\\n\\nindicate that it would have no play in the context\\n\\nof the duty of a Court, within the meaning of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_792\\\">Sections 33</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_793\\\">35</a> of the Stamp Act, to act in\\n\\nconsonance       therewith.      The     efficacy    of      the\\n\\nArbitration Clause in a contract is preserved so\\n\\nthat     the     extinguishing     of      the    contractual\\n\\nobligations by termination or non-performance or\\n\\nalleged performance, does not deprive the parties\\n\\nof their rights and the power of the Arbitrator to\\n\\nadjudicate      on   disputes,    which,    otherwise       fall\\n\\nwithin the ambit of the Arbitration Clause.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_212\\\">       The underlying principle behind treating the\\n\\nArbitration Agreement as a separate agreement is\\n\\nto create a mechanism, which survives the contract\\n\\nso that disputes, falling within the Arbitration\\n\\nAgreement, are resolved.

We now proceed to examine the question, whether the word\\n     “existence” in <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_891\\\">Section 11</a> merely refers to contract formation\\n     (whether there is an arbitration agreement) and excludes the\\n     question of enforcement (validity) and therefore the latter falls\\n     outside the jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage. On\\n     jurisprudentially and textualism it is possible to differentiate\\n     between existence of an arbitration agreement and validity of an\\n     arbitration agreement. Such interpretation can draw support from\\n     the plain meaning of the word “existence”. However, it is equally\\n     possible, jurisprudentially and on contextualism, to hold that an\\n     agreement has no existence if it is not enforceable and not binding.\\n     Existence of an arbitration agreement presupposes a valid\\n     agreement which would be enforced by the court by relegating the\\n     parties to arbitration. Legalistic and plain meaning interpretation\\n     would be contrary to the contextual background including the\\n     definition clause and would result in unpalatable consequences. A\\n     reasonable and just interpretation of “existence” requires\\n     understanding the context, the purpose and the relevant legal\\n     norms applicable for a binding and enforceable arbitration\\n     agreement. An agreement evidenced in writing has no meaning\\n     unless the parties can be compelled to adhere and abide by the\\n     terms. A party cannot sue and claim rights based on an\\n     unenforceable document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that\\n     an arbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal.

Mr. Banerjee submits that so far as the scope and ambit of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_913\\\">Section 11</a> is concerned, it is only to fill the gap and the Court is\\n\\nmerely functioning as an appointing authority where the parties fail\\n\\nto appoint an Arbitrator. After the insertion of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_914\\\">Section 11(6A)</a> (2015\\n\\nAmendment), the legislative policy and purport are essentially to\\n\\nminimize the Court’s intervention at the stage of appointing the\\n\\nArbitrator and with this intention, <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_915\\\">Section 11(6A)</a> has been\\n\\nincorporated which ought to be respected.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_251\\\">15. Mr. Banerjee further submits that the scope of the Court should\\n\\nbe circumscribed to confine to the examination, prima facie, of the\\n\\nformal existence of the arbitration agreement at the stage of contract\\n\\nformation, including whether the agreement is in writing and the core\\n\\ncontractual ingredients qua the formation of the agreement are\\n\\nfulfilled.

At the same time,\\n\\nso far as the Act, 1899 is concerned, it is only a fiscal measure\\n\\nenacted to secure revenue of the State in certain classes of\\n\\ninstruments but that may not be invoked to arm a litigant with a\\n\\nweapon of technicality to meet the case of his/her opponent.

Mr. Banerjee further submits that even non-payment of stamp\\n\\nduty is a curable defect and this defect can be cured at any stage\\n\\nbefore the instrument is admitted into evidence by the Arbitral\\n\\nTribunal. If the insufficiency of stamp or unduly stamped is being\\n\\nexamined/adjudicated at the pre-referral stage by the Court under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_916\\\">Section 11</a>, it would be nothing but to encourage parasitical\\n\\nchallenges and dilatory tactics in resisting reference to arbitration.\\n\\nThe natural solution inevitable is to appoint the Arbitrator and to\\n\\nallow the dispute resolution proceedings to commence and permit the\\n\\nArbitral Tribunal to fulfil its duty under the Act, 1996.

Alternatively, it can be\\n\\nunderstood as a mechanism to adjudicate disputes between the\\n\\nparties outside the court in a quasi-judicial manner.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_304\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1688760\\\" id=\\\"span_426\\\">52. The process of arbitration as a preferable method of dispute\\n\\nresolution is not new in India. According to the scholars of the\\n\\nancient Hindu literature, “Brhadaranayaka Upanishad” is the\\n\\nearliest known treatise that mentions a system that can be closely\\n\\nassociated with present-day arbitration as the same involved various\\n\\narbitral bodies such as “Puga” or the local courts, “Srenis” or the\\n\\npeople carrying out the same profession and “Kulas” or members\\n\\nconcerned with the social matters of the same part of the society. All\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_427\\\">\\f                                                                              32</span>\\n\\n\\nthe above-explained bodies were called the Panchas and cumulatively\\n\\nformed Panchayat. The same has been affirmed by the Privy Council\\n\\nin the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1688760/\\\" id=\\\"a_1034\\\">Vytla Sitanna v. Marivada Viranna12</a> wherein it was\\n\\nobserved that the parties used to refer the dispute to the elected\\n\\npanchayat and these adjudicating bodies were responsible to pass\\n\\nthe award which was based on the principle of fair and equitable\\n\\nsettlement of the dispute based on the prevalent legal as well as moral\\n\\ngrounds.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_305\\\">53. The arbitration regime in India further evolved with the\\n\\nenactment of the first Bengal Regulation by the Britishers in the year\\n\\nof 1772. Subsequent to this enactment, all the disputes were\\n\\nsubmitted to arbitration and the award of the same had the same\\n\\nvalue as that of any decree passed by the Court. Further, the Bengal\\n\\nRegulation of 1781 also contained provision as reproduced herein:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_174\\\">       “The judge do recommend and so far as he can without compulsion\\n       prevail upon the parties to submit to the arbitration of one person,\\n       to be mutually agreed upon by the parties … No award of any\\n       arbitrator be set aside, except upon full proof, made by oath of two\\n       creditable witnesses that the arbitrators had been guilty of gross\\n       corruption or partially, in the course of which they had made their\\n       award.”13\\n\\n\\n12 AIR 1934 PC 105.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_175\\\">13 C.

It is quite evident from the above-mentioned clause that the\\n\\nBengal Regulations contained provisions to enable the parties to refer\\n\\nthe dispute to be settled by the process of arbitration as per the\\n\\nmutual agreement of the parties, especially in disputes involving\\n\\nbreach of the contractual obligations and partnership deeds.\\n\\nArbitration also found a place in the earliest enacted legislation by\\n\\nthe State i.e., <a href=\\\"/doc/161831507/\\\" id=\\\"a_1035\\\">Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1859. Specifically, the\\n\\nprovision in Schedule II <a href=\\\"/doc/161831507/\\\" id=\\\"a_1036\\\">of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908\\n\\ncontained the procedure relating to arbitration. These statutory\\n\\nprovisions primarily dealt with two types of arbitrations:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_176\\\">       i) Arbitration initiated by the Courts in any pending civil\\n\\n          suit.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_177\\\">       ii) Arbitration wherein there is no involvement or\\n\\n          intervention of the Court.\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_307\\\">55. Apart from these two types of arbitration, there evolved a third\\n\\nkind of arbitration known as “Statutory Arbitration” wherein the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.icaindia.co.in/icanet/quterli/apr-june2002/ica5.html     (Last\\naccessed on 22nd January, 2023 at 10:50 pm).\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_429\\\">\\f                                                                     34</span>\\n\\n\\nprocedure of arbitration is governed by the provisions contained in\\n\\nthe statute.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_308\\\">56. The major development in the arbitration regime came with the\\n\\nenactment of the Arbitration Act, 1899 which was quite comparable\\n\\nto the English Arbitration Act, 1899. This enactment can be\\n\\nunderstood as the first step in the direction of enforcement of\\n\\narbitration in India.     The Arbitration Act, 1899 was initially\\n\\napplicable to all the presidency towns and there existed judicial\\n\\nintervention right from the initial reference of the dispute to the\\n\\nprocess of arbitration.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_309\\\">57. With the rapidly changing times, the evolution of the arbitration\\n\\nregime in India also gained momentum.

In the early 20th century, arbitration emerged as an\\n\\nacceptable mode of dispute resolution and in order to meet its\\n\\ngrowing popularity, the <a href=\\\"/doc/1052228/\\\" id=\\\"a_1038\\\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a>(hereinafter being\\n\\nreferred to as the “Act, 1940”) was enacted by the legislature. <a href=\\\"/doc/1052228/\\\" id=\\\"a_1039\\\">The\\n\\nAct, 1940</a> was enacted with the primary motive of providing speedy\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_430\\\">\\f                                                                              35</span>\\n\\n\\nand less costly method of dispute resolution in the form of\\n\\narbitration.

The words “inoperative or\\nincapable of being performed” in <a href=\\\"/doc/34625313/\\\" id=\\\"a_1109\\\">Section 45</a> of the Act have been\\ntaken from Article II(3) of the New York Convention as set out in para\\n27 of this judgment.

However, an\\narbitration clause is inoperative where it has ceased to have effect\\nas a result, for example, of a failure by the parties to comply with a\\ntime-limit, or where the parties have by their conduct impliedly\\nrevoked the arbitration agreement. By contrast, the expression\\n‘incapable of being performed’ appears to refer to more practical\\naspects of the prospective arbitration proceedings. It applies, for\\nexample, if for some reason it is impossible to establish the arbitral\\ntribunal.”\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_210\\\">34.

This may happen where the arbitration clause is too vaguely\\nworded, or other terms of the contract contradict the parties&#x27;\\nintention to arbitrate, as in the case of the so-called co-equal forum\\nselection clauses.

Consequently, the\\n     majority of authorities do not interpret these terms uniformly,\\n     resulting in an unfortunate lack of uniformity. With that caveat, we\\n     shall give an overview of typical examples where arbitration\\n     agreements were held to be (or not to be) inoperative or incapable of\\n     being performed.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_216\\\">     The terms inoperative refers to cases where the arbitration\\n     agreement has ceased to have effect by the time the court is asked\\n     to refer the parties to arbitration. For example, the arbitration\\n     agreement ceases to have effect if there has already been an arbitral\\n     award or a court decision with res judicata effect concerning the\\n     same subject-matter and parties. However, the mere existence of\\n     multiple proceedings is not sufficient to render the arbitration\\n     agreement inoperative. Additionally, the arbitration agreement can\\n     cease to have effect if the time-limit for initiating the arbitration or\\n     rendering the award has expired, provided that it was the parties&#x27;\\n     intent no longer to be bound by the arbitration agreement due to the\\n     expiration of this time-limit.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_217\\\">     Finally, several authorities have held that the arbitration agreement\\n     ceases to have effect if the parties waive arbitration. There are many\\n     possible ways of waiving a right to arbitrate. Most commonly, a party\\n     will waive the right to arbitrate if, in a court proceeding, it fails to\\n     properly invoke the arbitration agreement or if it actively pursues\\n     claims covered by the arbitration agreement.”\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_358\\\">88.

However, I regret my\\n\\n     inability to agree with the majority opinion and the concurring judgment.\\n\\n     Echoing the words of Charles Evans Hughes1 in one of his lectures delivered\\n\\n     at the University of Columbia, let our minority opinion (self and Learned\\n\\n     Brother Justice Ajay Rastogi, who has written a separate opinion), appeal to\\n\\n     the brooding spirit of the future as also the powers of the legislature to\\n\\n     examine the interplay between the <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1156\\\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> (for\\n\\n     short “<a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1157\\\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a>”)and the <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_1158\\\">Indian Stamp Act,1899</a> (for short “<a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_1159\\\">Stamp\\n\\n     Act,1899</a>”); and to emphatically resolve the imbroglio to avoid any confusion\\n\\n     in the minds of the stakeholders in the field of arbitration.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_387\\\">2. The role of Courts in arbitral proceedings has been much debated for years.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_388\\\">     Autonomy of the disputing party is the core of the arbitral process but if the\\n\\n     parties fail to arrive at a consensus, the supervisory role of Courts becomes\\n\\n     imperative.

The supervisory role of Courts under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1160\\\">Arbitration Act,1996</a> can be broadly\\n\\n   categorized into three parts i.e., pre-commencement of arbitral proceedings,\\n\\n   during the arbitral proceedings and at the post-arbitration stage. <a href=\\\"/doc/178250841/\\\" id=\\\"a_1161\\\">Section 8</a>\\n\\n   and <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1162\\\">Section 11</a> in <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1163\\\">Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996</a>, and <a href=\\\"/doc/34625313/\\\" id=\\\"a_1164\\\">Section 45</a> in <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1165\\\">Part II\\n\\n   of the Arbitration Act,1996</a> specifically deal with the role of Courts before the\\n\\n   initiation of arbitration proceedings. <a href=\\\"/doc/178250841/\\\" id=\\\"a_1166\\\">Section 8</a> deals with the “Power to refer\\n\\n   parties to arbitration” where there is an arbitration agreement; it provides for\\n\\n   a mandatory reference to arbitration, unless the Court is prima facie satisfied\\n\\n   that no valid arbitration agreement exists. <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1167\\\">Section 11(6)</a>, on the other hand,\\n\\n   provides for “Appointment of Arbitrators” when parties fail to mutually agree\\n\\n   on the name of an arbitrator or appoint an arbitrator in terms of the\\n\\n   arbitration agreement. <a href=\\\"/doc/34625313/\\\" id=\\\"a_1168\\\">Section 45</a> refers to the “Power of judicial authority to\\n\\n   refer parties to arbitration” in <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1169\\\">Part II of the Arbitration Act,1996</a>.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_390\\\">4. Here in this reference, the extent of judicial intervention before the\\n\\n   commencement of arbitral proceedings is being tested. It raises important\\n\\n   issues of delays in the enforcement of arbitration agreements, subject to\\n\\n   payment of stamp duty and whether an arbitration agreement would be non-\\n\\n   existent, invalid/void, or unenforceable in law, if the underlying instrument is\\n\\n   not stamped/insufficiently stamped, as per the relevant <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_1170\\\">Stamp Act</a>.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_391\\\">5. The moot question in this reference is whether the statutory bar under <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_1171\\\">Section\\n\\n   35</a> titled “Instruments not duly stamped inadmissible in Evidence” of the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_481\\\">                                     Page 3 of 78</span>\\n\\f     <a href=\\\"/doc/74910796/\\\" id=\\\"a_1172\\\">Stamp Act,1899</a> would be attracted when an arbitration agreement is\\n\\n     produced under <a href=\\\"/doc/605764/\\\" id=\\\"a_1173\\\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Arbitration Act,1996. As a corollary, this\\n\\n     reference also tests the scope and nature of the Court’s intervention\\n\\n     specifically at the stage of appointment of arbitrator under <a href=\\\"/doc/1841764/\\\" id=\\\"a_1174\\\">Section 11</a> of the\\n\\n     Arbitration Act, 1996.

The 67th Law Commission Report21 suggests that the idea of a fiscal\\n\\nenactment for the purpose of collecting revenue for the State first originated in\\n\\nHolland and thereafter, the Bengal <a href=\\\"/doc/126058684/\\\" id=\\\"a_1300\\\">Regulation 6</a> of 1797 was enacted in India.\\n\\nThis was initially limited to Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Banaras. Subsequently,\\n\\nvarious stamp regulations were introduced in Bombay and Madras. The Stamp\\n\\nduties were primarily intended to compensate for the deficiency in public revenue\\n\\ndue to abolition of tax for the maintenance of police establishments, leviable on\\n\\n“Indian Merchants and Traders”. However, the Regulation paved way for later\\n\\nenactments relating to stamp duty. In 1860, the first Act relating to Stamp duties\\n\\nwas enacted in India. This was repealed by the Act of 1862, 1869, 1879 and\\n\\nsubsequently, the Act of 1899 was enacted which is the current legislation.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_424\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"172406\\\" id=\\\"span_547\\\">23.

The four main reasons behind the dissent can be summarised as\\nunder:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_317\\\">      “111. ….Firstly, the function of the Court is to interpret the\\n      provision as it is and not to amend, alter or substitute by\\n      interpretative process. Secondly, it is for the legislature to make a\\n      law applicable to certain situations contemplated by it and the\\n      judiciary has no power in entering into ‘legislative wisdom’. Thirdly,\\n      as held by me, the ‘decision’ of the Chief Justice is merely prima\\n      facie decision and sub-section (1) of <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_1429\\\">Section 16</a> confers express\\n      power on the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction.\\n      Fourthly, it provides that remedy to deal with situations created by\\n      the order passed by the arbitral tribunal. The sheet anchor of his\\n      dissent is that in the guise of interpreting a statute, judicial\\n      legislation is not permissible.”\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_452\\\">47.   In the dissenting opinion in Paragraph 95 &amp; 96, Justice Thakkar further\\n\\nheld as under:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_318\\\">      “95. Now, let us consider <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_1430\\\">Section 16</a> of the Act. This section is new\\n      and did not find place in the old Act of 1940. Sub-section (1) of that\\n      section enables the Arbitral Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction. It\\n      further provides that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal includes ruling\\n      on any objections with respect to existence or validity of the\\n      arbitration agreement. Sub-sections (2), (3) and (4) lay down procedure\\n      of raising plea as to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and\\n      entertaining such plea. Sub-section (5) mandates that the Arbitral\\n      Tribunal “shall decide” such plea and, “where the Arbitral Tribunal\\n      takes a decision rejecting the plea, continue with the arbitral\\n      proceedings and make an arbitral award”. Sub-section (6) is equally\\n      important and expressly enacts that a party aggrieved by an arbitral\\n      award may invoke <a href=\\\"/doc/154608408/\\\" id=\\\"a_1431\\\">Section 34</a> of the Act for setting aside such award.\\n</blockquote>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_614\\\">                                   Page 31 of 78</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_319\\\">\\f        The provision appears to have been made to prevent dilatory tactics\\n        and abuse of immediate right to approach the court. If an aggrieved\\n        party has right to move the court, it would not have been possible to\\n        preclude the court from granting stay or interim relief which would\\n        bring the arbitration proceedings to a grinding halt. The provisions of\\n        <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_1432\\\">Section 16(6)</a> read with <a href=\\\"/doc/24401139/\\\" id=\\\"a_1433\\\">Section 5</a> now make the legal position clear,\\n        unambiguous and free from doubt.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_320\\\">        96.        <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_1434\\\">Section 16(1)</a> incorporates the well-known doctrine\\n        of Kompetenz-Kompetenz or competence de la competence. It\\n        recognises and enshrines an important principle that initially and\\n        primarily, it is for the Arbitral Tribunal itself to determine whether it\\n        has jurisdiction in the matter, subject of course, to ultimate court-\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_453\\\">        control. It is thus a rule of chronological priority. Kompetenz-\\n        Kompetenz is a widely accepted feature of modern international\\n        arbitration, and allows the Arbitral Tribunal to decide its own\\n        jurisdiction including ruling on any objections with respect to the\\n        existence or validity of the arbitration agreement, subject to final\\n        review by a competent court of law i.e. subject to <a href=\\\"/doc/154608408/\\\" id=\\\"a_1435\\\">Section 34</a> of the\\n        Act.”\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_454\\\">48. The above line of reasoning in Justice Thakkar’s dissent resonates with the\\n\\ninternationally recognized principle of Kompetenz Komptenz and the doctrine of\\n\\nseparability. The majority opinion in SBP (supra) suggests that a <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1436\\\">Section 11</a>\\n\\nCourt could conduct a mini-trial at the pre-referral stage.

The Court of\\n      Appeal held that : (Bus LR pp. 695 H-696 B &amp; F, paras 17 &amp; 19)\\n             “17. … For our part we consider that the time has now come for a line of\\n         some sort to be drawn and a fresh start made at any rate for cases arising\\n         in an international commercial context. Ordinary businessmen would be\\n         surprised at the nice distinctions drawn in the cases and the time taken up\\n         by argument in debating whether a particular case falls within one set of\\n         words or another very similar set of words. If businessmen go to the trouble\\n         of agreeing that their disputes be heard in the courts of a particular country\\n         or by a tribunal of their choice they do not expect (at any rate when they are\\n         making the contract in the first place) that time and expense will be taken in\\n         lengthy argument about the nature of particular causes of action and\\n         whether any particular cause of action comes within the meaning of the\\n         particular phrase they have chosen in their arbitration clause. If any\\n         businessman did want to exclude disputes about the validity of a contract,\\n         it would be comparatively simple to say so.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_479\\\">                                                  ***\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_480\\\">             19. One of the reasons given in the cases for a liberal construction of an\\n         arbitration clause is the presumption in favour of one-stop arbitration. It is\\n         not to be expected that any commercial man would knowingly create a\\n         system which required that the court should first decide whether the\\n         contract should be rectified or avoided or rescinded (as the case might be)\\n         and then, if the contract is held to be valid, required the arbitrator to resolve\\n         the issues that have arisen. This is indeed a powerful reason for a liberal\\n         construction.”\\n      Arbitration must provide a one-stop forum for resolution of disputes.\\n      The Court of Appeal held that if arbitrators can decide whether a contract\\n      is void for initial illegality, there is no reason why they should not decide\\n      whether a contract is procured by bribery, just as much as they can\\n      decide whether a contract has been vitiated by misrepresentation or non-\\n      disclosure.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_481\\\">                                                               [Emphasis supplied]\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_482\\\">64. Thus, the one-stop arbitration approach would ensure that all issues on\\n\\ninitial illegality or whether a contract is void can be decided by the arbitral\\n\\ninstitutions subject, of course, to the ultimate supervisory jurisdiction of the\\n\\nCourts.

The judicial position on the enforceability of an arbitration agreement\\n\\ncontained in an unstamped or insufficiently stamped agreement can be traced\\n\\nfrom this Court’s 2011 decision in <a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_1483\\\">SMS Tea</a> (supra). The facts of the case were\\n\\nthat the appellant was granted lease of two tea estates for a term of 30 years.\\n\\nThe leases deed contained an arbitration clause. On abrupt eviction by the\\n\\nrespondent from the tea estates, the appellant filed an application under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1841764/\\\" id=\\\"a_1484\\\">Section 11</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for the appointment of arbitrator. The\\n\\nlearned Chief Justice of Guwahati High Court dismissed the <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1485\\\">Section 11</a>\\n\\napplication and held that the lease deed was compulsorily registrable under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/561156/\\\" id=\\\"a_1486\\\">Section 17</a> of the Registration Act,1908 and <a href=\\\"/doc/80042/\\\" id=\\\"a_1487\\\">Section 106</a> of the Transfer of\\n\\nProperty Act,1882 ; and as the lease deed was not registered, even the\\n\\narbitration clause would be rendered invalid. The matter reached this Court\\n\\nwhere one of the questions was whether an arbitration agreement in an\\n\\nunregistered instrument which is not duly stamped, is valid and enforceable. It\\n\\nwas observed that the arbitration agreement in an unstamped or insufficiently\\n\\nstamped instrument is invalid, given that <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_1488\\\">Section 35</a> of the Stamp Act, 1899\\n\\nexpressly bars the authority before which such unstamped or insufficiently\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_638\\\">                                   Page 41 of 78</span>\\n\\fstamped instrument is presented to act on such an instrument.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1243245\\\" id=\\\"span_639\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24736\\\" id=\\\"span_640\\\">At this stage, it\\n\\nis important to keep in mind that decision in <a href=\\\"/doc/24736/\\\" id=\\\"a_1489\\\">SMS</a> (supra)came at a time when\\n\\nSBP (supra) and <a href=\\\"/doc/1243245/\\\" id=\\\"a_1490\\\">Boghara Polyfab</a> (supra) continued to hold the field i.e. prior to\\n\\nthe insertion of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1491\\\">Section 11(6A)</a> to the Act.

On a harmonious reading of the inconsistencies in the provisions of\\n\\nthe three different Acts quoted earlier, we find that the general law must\\n\\nyield to the special law in the sense, that an arbitration agreement cannot\\n\\nbe rendered void on insufficient stamping by a general law, especially when\\n\\nnone of the provisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1670\\\">Arbitration Act,1996</a> which is a special Act\\n\\nprovide for stamping.

Moreover, when the words of the statute in <a href=\\\"/doc/596725/\\\" id=\\\"a_1678\\\">Section 11</a> of the\\n\\nArbitration Act ,1996 do not mention “validity” or even “inoperable and\\n\\nincapable of being performed” as mentioned in <a href=\\\"/doc/160474/\\\" id=\\\"a_1679\\\">Section 45</a> of the Arbitration\\n\\nAct,1996 or “prima facie no valid arbitration agreement” in <a href=\\\"/doc/1146817/\\\" id=\\\"a_1680\\\">Section 8</a> of the\\n\\nArbitration Act, 1996, it must be understood that the general words in a\\n\\ndifferent statute such as the <a href=\\\"/doc/171398/\\\" id=\\\"a_1681\\\">Contract Act, 1872</a> cannot override the specific\\n\\nwords used in the special law. That is to say, that an arbitration agreement\\n\\ncannot be rendered “void” on insufficient stamping by a <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1682\\\">Section 11</a> judge\\n\\nwhen the scope of examination is only limited to the “existence” of the\\n\\narbitration agreement and not “validity”.\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_715\\\">                                 Page 56 of 78</span>\\n\\f79.3. Coming back to the evidentiary bar under <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_1683\\\">Section 35</a> of the Stamp\\n\\nAct,1899 it is important to understand that since the scope of a <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1684\\\">Section 11</a>\\n\\njudge is limited, the court cannot receive evidence in such cases. Before the\\n\\n2015 <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1685\\\">Amendment to the Arbitration Act,1996</a>, as per the position <a href=\\\"/doc/174675/\\\" id=\\\"a_1686\\\">laid down\\n\\nin</a> SBP(supra), the Chief Justice had wide powers to receive evidence,\\n\\nincluding affidavits, and get evidence recorded at the stage of appointment\\n\\nof arbitrator. Under the amended <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1687\\\">Section 11</a>, as noted before, the scope is\\n\\n“confined” to the examination of the “existence” of the arbitration agreement.\\n\\nThus, post-amendment, it can most certainly not admit evidence. A <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1688\\\">Section\\n\\n11</a> Court is “not an authority to receive evidence” as provided in <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_1689\\\">Section 35</a>\\n\\nof the Stamp Act,1899. Moreover, it is an undisputed position that <a href=\\\"/doc/1039283/\\\" id=\\\"a_1690\\\">Section\\n\\n35</a> of the Arbitration Act,1996 does not preclude an arbitrator to impound or\\n\\nadmit evidence. It states “any person having by law or consent of parties,\\n\\nauthority to receive evidence.” Thus, the statutory bar under <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_1691\\\">Section 35</a> of\\n\\nthe Stamp Act,1899 would not apply when a document is produced at the\\n\\nstage of a <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1692\\\">Section 11</a> proceeding of the <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1693\\\">Arbitration Act,1996</a>.\\n\\n79.4. It is essential to interpret the special law in a way that gives effect to\\n\\nits specific provisions, while also ensuring that it is consistent with the\\n\\ngeneral law to the extent possible. Impounding at the stage of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1694\\\">Section 11</a>\\n\\nwould stall arbitral proceedings right at the outset because of the statutory\\n\\nbar under <a href=\\\"/doc/176042882/\\\" id=\\\"a_1695\\\">Section 35</a> of the Stamp Act, 1899.

Second, the bar for judicial intervention\\n         (despite the existence of <a href=\\\"/doc/24401139/\\\" id=\\\"a_1773\\\">section 5</a> of the Act) has been consistently set at a\\n         low threshold by the Indian judiciary, which translates into many more\\n         admissions of cases in Court which arise out of or are related to the Act.”\\n\\n                                                                 [emphasis supplied]\\n\\n 85.6.

Discussion on Vidya Drolia\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_546\\\">86. This case was concerned with the arbitrability of landlord-tenant disputes\\n\\nand the forum before which the issue of arbitrability must first be raised. The\\n\\nparagraph 146 as quoted below may require a relook in the context of the issue\\n\\nunder consideration.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_547\\\">        “146. We now proceed to examine the question, whether the word\\n        &quot;existence&quot; in <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1795\\\">Section 11</a> merely refers to contract formation (whether\\n        there is an arbitration agreement) and excludes the question of\\n        enforcement (validity) and therefore the latter falls outside the\\n        jurisdiction of the court at the referral stage. On jurisprudentially and\\n        textualism it is possible to differentiate between existence of an\\n        arbitration agreement and validity of an arbitration agreement. Such\\n        interpretation can draw support from the plain meaning of the word\\n        &quot;existence&quot;. However, it is equally possible, jurisprudentially and on\\n        contextualism, to hold that an agreement has no existence if is not\\n        enforceable and not binding. Existence of an arbitration agreement\\n        presupposes a valid agreement which would be enforced by the court by\\n        relegating the parties to arbitration. Legalistic and plain meaning\\n        interpretation would be contrary to the contextual background including\\n        the definition clause and would result in unpalatable consequences. A\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_791\\\">                                    Page 73 of 78</span>\\n\\f         reasonable and just interpretation of existence requires understanding\\n         the context. the purpose and the relevant legal norms applicable for a\\n         binding and enforceable arbitration agreement. An agreement evidenced\\n         in writing has no meaning unless the parties can be compelled to adhere\\n         and abide by the terms. A party cannot sue and claim rights based on\\n         an unenforceable document. Thus, there are good reasons to hold that\\n         an arbitration agreement exists only when it is valid and legal. A void\\n         and unenforceable understanding is no agreement to do anything.\\n         Existence of an arbitration agreement means an arbitration agreement\\n         that meets and satisfies the statutory requirements of both the\\n         Arbitration Act and the Contract Act and when it is enforceable in law.”\\n\\n\\n86.1. As can be seen, the Court equated existence and validity and it was held\\n\\nthat a contract only exists if it is valid. And it is valid only if it is enforceable.\\n\\nAs far as the issue in the present case is concerned, the authors’ Comments in\\n\\nRussell on Arbitration85(24th Edition) in the context of English law provide\\n\\nuseful pointers in this context:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_415\\\">         <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"26596259\\\" id=\\\"span_792\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"121987320\\\" id=\\\"span_793\\\">“Existence and Validity of the arbitration agreement. .. the Court\\n         draws a distinction between existence of the arbitration agreement,\\n         which is likely to be a matter for the Court(unless a stay under the\\n         inherent jurisdiction is granted) and its validity, which wherever\\n         possible should be left to the arbitrators.”\\n                                                            [emphasis      in\\n         original]\\n86.2 I have already discussed that in the Indian regime, the Arbitrator under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_1796\\\">Section 16</a> has the jurisdiction to decide on “existence” and “validity”.

When unanimity can be obtained without\\n          sacrifice of conviction, it strongly commends the decision to public\\n          confidence. But unanimity, which is merely formal, which is recorded\\n          at the expense of strong, conflicting views, is not desirable in a court\\n          of last resort, whatever may be the effect on public opinion at the\\n          time. This is so because what must ultimately sustain the court in\\n          public confidence of is the character and independence of the\\n          judges.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_550\\\">87.1 The practice of dissent in judicial decision-making process plays a\\n\\ncritical     role   in   revealing   constitutional    commitment       to   deliberative\\n\\ndemocracy.

The contours of the jurisdiction of the judge referring matters for\\n\\narbitration, cannot be permitted to suffer from confusion and ambiguity.

In such backdrop, the interplay between the Acts and\\n\\nhow its objective is to be achieved in the course of Arbitral proceedings\\n\\neither at the referral stage or thereafter is much too important to be left\\n\\nlingering for a clarificatory verdict by a larger Bench.

While fully endorsing the opinion of\\nlearned brother Justice K. M. Joseph, to which my\\nlearned brother Justice Aniruddha Bose has concurred, I\\nwish to add a concise addendum as under, in respect of\\nsome of the issues, of course, only in support of findings\\nreturned thereon.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_559\\\">2.    The issue(s) under reference, the modification of\\nthe referred question and the allied questions cropped\\nup for consideration have been elaborately dealt with\\nand answered in the erudite draft judgment of my\\nlearned brother Justice K.M. Joseph and hence, it is\\nabsolutely unessential to refer them. While considering\\nthe power of the Court under <a href=\\\"/doc/605764/\\\" id=\\\"a_1817\\\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 it is to be noted\\nthat the position of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1818\\\">Section 11(6)</a> before and after the\\namendment and <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1819\\\">Section 11(6A)</a>, inserted by Act 2 of 2016\\nwith effect from 23.10.2015 have been referred to in all\\nthe three opinions. Hence, I do not think it necessary to\\nextract those provisions to avoid the risk of repetition.\\nCertainly, the powers conferred under <a href=\\\"/doc/55692809/\\\" id=\\\"a_1820\\\">Section 16</a> of the\\nAct often referred to as ‘Kompetenz-Kompetenz’ make it\\nclear that the Arbitral Tribunal is empowered and thus\\ngot competence to rule on its own jurisdiction, including\\non all jurisdictional issues and existence or validity of the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_810\\\"> CA No. 3802-3803 of 2020                           Page 2 of 19</span>\\n\\farbitration agreement. This provision would have its\\nfull-play when appointment of the arbitrator takes place,\\non consensus, by the parties, in accordance with the\\nterms of the arbitration agreement or by designated\\narbitration institution, without the intervention of the\\nCourt. But then, the provision under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1821\\\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the\\nAct applies when the procedures envisaged under the\\narbitration agreement have not worked and an\\napplication is filed for invocation of the power\\nthereunder before the Court for making appointment of\\nthe Arbitrator(s).             The controversy in regard to the\\nnature of the function to be performed under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1822\\\">Section 11\\n(6)</a> has been set at rest by the Seven-Judge Bench\\ndecision in SBP &amp; Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.1 by holding\\nthat it is ‘judicial’. It continues to be ‘judicial’ despite the\\namendment brought to the said section and even after\\nthe insertion of <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1823\\\">Section 11 (6A)</a> in the Act. An application\\nfor ‘Appointment of Arbitrators’ is filed, by one party\\nasserting the existence of an arbitration agreement or\\narbitration clause in an ‘instrument’ executed between\\nthe parties concerned. Therefore, invariably what is to\\nbe decided, in invocation of the said powers, is the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_811\\\">1</span>\\n    (2005) 8 SCC 618\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_812\\\">    CA No. 3802-3803 of 2020                            Page 3 of 19</span>\\n\\fasserted factum of existence of arbitration agreement or\\narbitration clause in the said instrument and invariably,\\nin this regard the party who invoked the said power\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1824\\\">Section 11(6)</a>, has to produce that very relied on\\ninstrument for inspection. The question is whether while\\npassing an order the Court exercising the power under\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1825\\\">Section 11 (6)</a> receives any evidence, for the limited\\npurpose of ascertaining the truth of the assertion that the\\ndocument thus produced is an arbitration agreement or\\nan instrument containing arbitration clause.       In this\\nregard it is only apposite to refer to the meaning\\nascribable to the term ‘evidence’. As per Peter Murphy\\nin ‘A Practical Approach to Evidence (Second Edition),\\n1985, ‘evidence’ may be defined as any ‘material’ which\\ntends to persuade the Court of the truth or probity of\\nsame fact asserted before it. As noted hereinbefore, in\\nsuch an application under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1826\\\">Section 11 (6)</a>, invariably the\\nfact to be asserted would be the existence of ‘arbitration\\nagreement’ and in proof thereof the material viz., the\\ndocument would be produced. I will refer to the relevant\\nprovision in the statutory scheme viz., the Appointment\\nof Arbitrators by the Chief Justice of India Scheme, 1996,\\nlater.   Now, when that is received, it is nothing but\\nreceiving evidence to that limited purpose for deciding\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_813\\\"> CA No. 3802-3803 of 2020                         Page 4 of 19</span>\\n\\fthe question whether the ‘instrument’ produced is one\\nexecuted             between   the   parties   is   an   arbitration\\nagreement or whether the instrument contained an\\narbitration clause. Necessarily, if the answer is in the\\naffirmative, an order appointing Arbitrator(s) would be\\npassed and an answer in the negative would be the end\\nof such proceedings. In that view of the matter, it can\\nsafely be said that what is to be decided while\\nperforming the function under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1827\\\">Section 11 (6)</a> is relating a\\n‘jurisdictional aspect’ as only on returning a finding that\\nthere exists an arbitration agreement or arbitration\\nclause, in the material so produced, that arbitrator(s)\\nwould be appointed. The answering of that question, on\\nreceiving the ‘instrument’, is the performance of the\\nfunction describable as “acting upon” the document thus\\nproduced. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"346791\\\" id=\\\"span_814\\\">In other words, as discernible from the\\nstatement of law by M.C.

Kuntu Lal &amp; Anr..2</a>, (the relevant paragraph 8\\nextracted in the opinion of learned brother Justice K.M.\\nJoseph), ‘acting upon’ is not included in the act of\\nadmitting an instrument, though it can be acted upon,\\nlater, subject to permissibility in law therefor.\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_815\\\">2</span>\\n    ILR [1952] 2 All 984</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_816\\\">    CA No. 3802-3803 of 2020                               Page 5 of 19</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_560\\\">\\f3.    The cleavage in opinion occurs on the issue as to\\nwhether the Court called upon to invoke the power\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1829\\\">Section 11 (6)</a> should or could exercise the power\\ncoupled with duty under <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1830\\\">Section 33</a> of the Indian Stamp\\nAct, 1899, when the document carrying the arbitration\\nagreement or arbitration clause is found unstamped or\\ninsufficiently stamped or without going into such matter,\\nshould it confine its exercise of power in the matter of\\nappointment of Arbitrator(s) only and refrain itself from\\nproceeding further in view of the mandate under <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1831\\\">Section\\n33</a> of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. I have already recorded\\nmy agreement with the opinion of my learned brother\\nK.M. Joseph that exercise of power coupled with duty\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1832\\\">Section 33</a> of the Stamp Act cannot be accused of\\njudicial interference in contravention to <a href=\\\"/doc/24401139/\\\" id=\\\"a_1833\\\">Section 5</a> of the\\nAct and further that it shall not be confused with\\nexamination whether an arbitration agreement or\\narbitration clause in the said instrument, exists so as to\\nappoint arbitrator in invocation of the power under\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1834\\\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act. In that view of the matter, the\\nprovisions under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1835\\\">Section 11(6A)</a> or 16 of the Act cannot\\nact as a rider for the exercise of the said power under\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1836\\\">Section 33</a> of the Stamp Act.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_561\\\">\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_817\\\"> CA No. 3802-3803 of 2020                         Page 6 of 19</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_562\\\">\\f4.

I have already found that receiving the very\\n‘instrument’ which is carrying the arbitration agreement\\nor containing an arbitration clause from the party who\\nasserts its existence is essentially an act of receiving the\\nevidence, in that limited sense. Therefore, how can the\\nCourt, which is having authority and competence to\\nreceive evidence, for the purpose of invoking the power\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1840\\\">Section 11 (6)</a>, abstain from proceeding further in\\nterms of <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1841\\\">Section 33</a> if it appears to it that such instrument\\nproduced before it, though required to be stamped, is\\nunstamped or is not duly stamped. According to me, in\\nterms of the mandate under Sub-section (2) of <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1842\\\">Section 33</a>,\\nfor that purpose, the <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1843\\\">Section 11</a> Judge who received\\nevidence shall ‘examine’ the instrument so chargeable\\nand so produced in order to ascertain whether it is\\nstamped with a stamp of the value and description\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_819\\\"> CA No. 3802-3803 of 2020                               Page 8 of 19</span>\\n\\frequired by the law in force in India, when such\\ninstrument was executed or first executed. Proviso (b)\\nwhich is extracted hereinbefore, would only permit a\\nJudge of the High Court for delegation of the duty of\\nexamining and impounding any such instrument to such\\nofficer as the Court may appoint in that behalf. Thus, it\\nonly gives discretion to a Judge of the High Court to\\ndelegate the duty of examining and impounding any\\nsuch instrument in the manner mentioned under the said\\nproviso if he chooses not to proceed in the manner\\nprovided for impounding the instrument in accordance\\nwith the relevant provision, by himself.     When that be\\nthe provision under <a href=\\\"/doc/75405957/\\\" id=\\\"a_1844\\\">Section 33 (1)</a> and (2), a conjoint\\nreading of which obviously makes it mandatory for the\\nCourt exercising the power under <a href=\\\"/doc/52386413/\\\" id=\\\"a_1845\\\">Section 11 (6)</a> to\\nproceed in terms of the mandate under <a href=\\\"/doc/61287904/\\\" id=\\\"a_1846\\\">Section 33</a> when\\nthe circumstances legally invites its invocation.
