Apart from above, it has been further averred in the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     reply that as per <a href=\\\"/doc/182646620/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Section 29-A(3)</a> of the Act, learned Arbitrator can\\n\\n     extend time to a period not exceeding six months, meaning thereby, in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     any eventuality, award is to be passed within eighteen months from the\\n\\n     date of completion of proceedings.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">     5.
