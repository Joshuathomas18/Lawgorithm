The burden of\\n     proving the guilt of the accused is upon\\n     the prosecution and unless it relieves\\n     itself of that burden, the courts cannot\\n     record a finding of the guilt of the\\n     accused. There are certain cases in which\\n     statutory presumptions arise regarding the\\n     guilt of the accused, but the burden even\\n     in those cases is upon the prosecution to\\n     prove the existence of facts which have to\\n     be present before the presumption can be\\n     drawn. Once those facts are shown by the\\n     prosecution to exist, the Court can raise\\n     the statutory presumption and it would, in\\n     such an event, be for the accused to rebut\\n     the presumption. The onus even in such\\n     cases upon the accused is not as heavy as\\n     is normally upon the prosecution to prove\\n     the guilt of the accused. If some material\\n     is brought on the record consistent with\\n     the innocence of the accused which may\\n     reasonably be true, even though it is not\\n     positively proved to be true, the accused\\n     would be entitled to acquittal.”\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1891718\\\" id=\\\"span_21\\\">11.

Upon    consideration     of    various\\n      judgments    as    noted    hereinabove,    the\\n      position of law which emerges is that once\\n      execution    of   the   promissory   note    is\\n      admitted, the presumption under <a href=\\\"/doc/1177058/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">Section\\n      118(a)</a> would arise that it is supported by\\n      a consideration. Such a presumption is\\n      rebuttable. The defendant can prove the\\n      non-existence of a consideration by raising\\n      a probable defence. If the defendant is\\n      proved to have discharged the initial onus\\n      of proof showing that the existence of\\n      consideration was improbable or doubtful or\\n      the same was illegal, the onus would shift\\n      to the plaintiff who will be obliged to\\n      prove it as a matter of fact and upon its\\n      failure to prove would disentitle him to\\n      the grant of relief on the basis of the\\n      negotiable instrument. The burden upon the\\n      defendant of proving the non-existence of\\n      the consideration can be either direct or\\n      by bringing on record the preponderance of\\n      probabilities     by     reference    to    the\\n      circumstances upon which he relies. In such\\n      an event, the plaintiff is entitled under\\n      law to rely upon all the evidence led in\\n      the case including that of the plaintiff as\\n      well.

The bare denial of the\\n     passing of the consideration apparently\\n     does   not   appear    to   be   any   defence.\\n     Something which is probable has to be\\n     brought on record for getting the benefit\\n     of shifting the onus of proving to the\\n     plaintiff. To disprove the presumption, the\\n     defendant has to bring on record such facts\\n     and circumstances upon consideration of\\n     which the court may either believe that the\\n     consideration did not exist or its non-\\n     existence was so probable that a prudent\\n     man would, under the circumstances of the\\n     case, shall act upon the plea that it did\\n     not exist……”\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"533881\\\" id=\\\"span_24\\\">12.

In\\n      such    a    scenario,     the    test   of\\n      proportionality     should     guide    the\\n      construction and interpretation of reverse\\n      onus clauses and the defendant-accused\\n      cannot be expected to discharge an unduly\\n      high standard of proof.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_28\\\">      28.

Keeping this in\\n       view, it is a settled position that when an\\n       accused has to rebut the presumption under\\n       Section 139, the standard of proof for\\n       doing so is that of “preponderance of\\n       probabilities”. Therefore, if the accused\\n       is able to raise a probable defence which\\n       creates doubts about the existence of a\\n       legally enforceable debt or liability, the\\n       prosecution can fail.

In\\n\\ncross-examination           of    the        PW1,    when      the    specific\\n\\nquestion was put that cheque was issued in relation\\n\\nto loan of Rs.25,000/- taken by the accused, the PW1\\n\\nsaid that he does not remember.                      PW1 in his evidence\\n\\nadmitted that he retired in 1997 on which date he\\n\\nreceived monetary benefit of Rs. 8 lakhs, which was\\n\\nencashed by the complainant.                   It was also brought in\\n\\nthe evidence that in the year 2010, the complainant\\n\\nentered into a sale agreement for which he paid an\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_48\\\">                                        29</span>\\n\\famount of Rs.4,50,000/- to Balana Gouda towards sale\\n\\nconsideration.

During\\n\\nhis cross-examination, when financial capacity to pay\\n\\nRs.6 lakhs to the accused was questioned, there was\\n\\nno satisfactory reply given by the complainant.                  The\\n\\nevidence on record, thus, is a probable defence on\\n\\nbehalf of the accused, which shifted the burden on\\n\\nthe complainant to prove his financial capacity and\\n\\nother facts.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_40\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_41\\\">25. There was another evidence on the record, i.e.,\\n\\ncopy of plaint in O.S.

Thus, there\\n\\nwas evidence on record to indicate that in December,\\n\\n2009, he gave Rs.7 lakhs in sale agreement, in 2010,\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_49\\\">                               30</span>\\n\\fhe   made     payment   of     Rs.4,50,000/-            towards       sale\\n\\nconsideration     and       further    he        gave    a     loan    of\\n\\nRs.50,000/- for which complaint was filed in 2012 and\\n\\nfurther loan of Rs.6 lakhs in November, 2011.                     Thus,\\n\\nduring the period from 2009 to November, 2011, amount\\n\\nof   Rs.18    lakhs   was    given     by    the    complainant        to\\n\\ndifferent persons including the accused, which put a\\n\\nheavy burden to prove the financial capacity when it\\n\\nwas questioned on behalf of the accused,                   the accused\\n\\nbeing     a   retired       employee        of     State       Transport\\n\\nCorporation, who retired in 1997 and total retirement\\n\\nbenefits, which were encashed were Rs.8 lakhs only.\\n\\nThe High Court observed that though the complainant\\n\\nis retired employee, the accused did not even suggest\\n\\nthat pension is the only means for survival of the\\n\\ncomplainant.      Following      observations           were    made    in\\n\\nParagraph 16 of the judgment of the High Court:-\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_38\\\">        “16.    Though the complainant is retired\\n        employee, the accused did not even suggest\\n        that pension is the only means for survival\\n        of    the     complainant.   Under    these\\n        circumstances, the Trial Court’s finding\\n        that the complainant failed to discharge\\n        his initial burden of proof of lending\\n        capacity is perverse.”\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_50\\\">                                31</span>\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_42\\\">\\f26. There is one more aspect of the matter which also\\n\\nneeds to be noticed. In the complaint filed by the\\n\\ncomplainant as well as in examination-in-chief the\\n\\ncomplainant has not mentioned as to on which date,\\n\\nthe loan of Rs.6 lakhs was given to the accused.                            It\\n\\nwas    during cross-examination,             he gave          the date       as\\n\\nNovember, 2011.          Under Section 118(b), a presumption\\n\\nshall    be   made    as      to    date    that      every       negotiable\\n\\ninstrument     was       made       or     drawn        on    such     date.\\n\\nAdmittedly, the cheque is dated 27.02.2012, there is\\n\\nnot even a suggestion by the complainant that a post\\n\\ndated    cheque    was     given     to    him     in    November,         2011\\n\\nbearing    dated     27.02.2012.           Giving       of    a    cheque   on\\n\\n27.02.2012, which was deposited on 01.03.2012 is not\\n\\ncompatible with the case of the complainant when we\\n\\nread    the   complaint         submitted        by     the       complainant\\n\\nespecially     Para       1    of    the     complaint,            which    is\\n\\nextracted as below:-\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_39\\\">       “1.   The accused is a very good friend of\\n       the complainant.  The accused requested the\\n       Complainant a hand loan to meet out urgent\\n       and family necessary a sum of Rs.6,00,000/-\\n       (Rupees Six Lakh) and on account of long\\n       standing   friendship   and   knowing   the\\n       difficulties, which is being faced by the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_51\\\">                                     32</span>\\n\\f      accused the complainant agreed to lend hand\\n      loan to meet out the financial difficulties\\n      of   the   accused   and   accordingly   the\\n      Complainant lend hand loan Rs.6,00,000/-\\n      (Rupees Six Lakh) dated 27.02.2012 in favour\\n      of the Complainant stating that on its\\n      presentation it will be honored. But to the\\n      surprise of the Complainant on presentation\\n      of the same for collection through his Bank\\n      the Cheque was returned by the Bank with an\\n      endorsement “Funds Insufficient” on 01-03-\\n      2012.”\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_40\\\">27. Thus,    there    is   a   contradiction    in    what    was\\n\\ninitially stated by the complainant in the complaint\\n\\nand   in   his   examination-in-chief     regarding    date    on\\n\\nwhich loan was given on one side and what was said in\\n\\ncross-examination in other side, which has not been\\n\\nsatisfactorily explained.           The High Court was unduly\\n\\ninfluenced by the fact that the accused did not reply\\n\\nthe notice denying the execution of cheque or legal\\n\\nliability.

We are of the view that when evidence was led\\n\\nbefore the Court to indicate that apart from loan of\\n\\nRs.6 lakhs given to the accused, within 02 years,\\n\\namount of Rs.18 lakhs have been given out by the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_53\\\">                               33</span>\\n\\fcomplainant      and        his     financial      capacity      being\\n\\nquestioned, it was incumbent on the complainant to\\n\\nhave explained his financial capacity.                 Court cannot\\n\\ninsist on a person to lead negative evidence.                        The\\n\\nobservation    of     the    High    Court    that    trial   court’s\\n\\nfinding   that   the     complainant      failed      to    prove    his\\n\\nfinancial     capacity       of    lending    money    is     perverse\\n\\ncannot be supported.              We fail to see that how the\\n\\ntrial court’s findings can be termed as perverse by\\n\\nthe High Court when it was based on consideration of\\n\\nthe evidence, which was led on behalf of the defence.\\n\\nThis Court had occasion to consider the expression\\n\\n“perverse” in <a href=\\\"/doc/361965/\\\" id=\\\"a_73\\\">Gamini Bala Koteswara Rao and others\\n\\nVs. State of Andhra Pradesh</a> through Secretary, (2009)\\n\\n10 SCC 636, this Court held that although High Court\\n\\ncan reappraise the evidence and conclusions drawn by\\n\\nthe   trial   court    but    judgment       of   acquittal    can    be\\n\\ninterfered with only judgment is against the weight\\n\\nof evidence.        In Paragraph No.14 following has been\\n\\nheld:-</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_41\\\">      “14. We have considered the arguments\\n      advanced and heard the matter at great\\n      length.

It is, however, well settled\\n     by now that it is open to the High Court to\\n     reappraise the evidence and conclusions\\n     drawn by the trial court but only in a case\\n     when the judgment of the trial court is\\n     stated to be perverse. The word “perverse”\\n     in terms as understood in law has been\\n     defined to mean “against the weight of\\n     evidence”.
