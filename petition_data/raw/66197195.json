However,         according         to\\n\\n    Mr.Syed, in the said judgment delivered by\\n\\n    this Court, the attention of this Court was\\n\\n    not     drawn       to    <a href=\\\"/doc/179886220/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section             132</a>    of   the       Gujarat\\n\\n    Prohibition Act, 1949.

In Pareshkumar Jaykarbhai (supra), this Court\\n\\n    held as under;\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">           &quot;50. The scheme of Section 98 would show that\\n           the things mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) are\\n           straightway to be confiscated. But in respect\\n           of any receptacle, package or covering in which\\n           any of the articles liable to confiscation\\n           under Sub-Section (1) are found and the\\n           animals, carts, vessels, or other conveyances\\n           used in carrying any such articles they are not\\n           to be confiscated straightway but they are\\n           liable to confiscation. There is understandable\\n           distinction between the things which must be\\n           straightway confiscated as provided by Section\\n           98(1) and the things which are liable to\\n           confiscation. This should be in the very nature\\n           of things. Things like intoxicant, hemp, mhowra\\n           flowers, molasses, materials, still utensil,\\n           implement or apparatus in respect of which\\n           offence appears to have been committed under\\n           the <a href=\\\"/doc/4377279/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Bombay Prohibition Act</a> should straightway\\n           be confiscated because their possession per se\\n           is prohibited. They must be confiscated because\\n           they cannot be returned otherwise to the person\\n           to whom it is returned would be committing the\\n           same offence over again. They are articles, the\\n           possession of which is per se prohibited in\\n           view of the provisions contained in the Bombay\\n           Prohibition Act. But vessels, conveyances,\\n           carts and animals used for transport of such\\n           prohibited articles are not per se prohibited\\n           and therefore, they cannot be straightway\\n           confiscated. They are liable to confiscation in\\n           view of the use made of such things. Section 99\\n           provides the procedure to be followed by the\\n           Court in respect of the things liable to\\n           confiscation   before  they    are confiscated.\\n           Section 99 provides as under :\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">           &quot;99. When during the trial of a case for an\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">                                Page 7 of 23</span>\\n R/SCR.A/2185/2018                                  JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n      offence under this Act the court decides that\\n      anything is liable to confiscation under the\\n      foregoing section, the Court may after hearing\\n      the person, if any, claiming any right thereto\\n      and the evidence if any, which he produces in\\n      support of his claim order confiscation or in\\n      the   case  of   any  article   other  than an\\n      intoxicant, hemp, mhowra flowers or molasses\\n      give the owner an option to pay fine as the\\n      court deems fit in lieu of confiscation :\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_3\\\">      Provided that no animal, cart, vehicle or other\\n      conveyance shall be confiscated if the owner\\n      thereof satisfies the court that he had\\n      exercised due care in preventing the commission\\n      of the offence.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_26\\\">      It appears that the articles which are liable\\n      to confiscation can only be confiscated after\\n      hearing the person claiming any right thereto\\n      and the evidence if any which he produces in\\n      support of his claim. The proviso to Section99\\n      makes it abundantly clear that vessel or\\n      vehicle   or   other   conveyance   cannot   be\\n      confiscated if the owner satisfies the Court\\n      that he had exercised due care in preventing\\n      the commission of the offence. Therefore, when\\n      anything liable to confiscation is to be\\n      confiscated the Court has to hear the person\\n      claiming any right thereto. Such a person has a\\n      right to lead evidence in support of his claim.\\n      He has also an option to pay fine in lieu of\\n      confiscation. In respect of the vehicle or\\n      conveyance the same cannot be confiscated if\\n      the owner shows that he had taken sufficient\\n      care to prevent the commission of the offence.\\n      He can do so by leading evidence. Therefore,\\n      before the Court proceeds to confiscate a\\n      vehicle, vessel or a conveyance, it must give\\n      an opportunity to the owner thereof to show\\n      whether he had used sufficient care to prevent\\n      the commission of the offence. In fact before\\n      an order of confiscation is passed an inquiry\\n      as contemplated by Section 99 would be made.\\n      Such an inquiry is to be made in respect of the\\n      articles liable to confiscation and not those\\n      which are required to be confiscated as a\\n      necessary corollary as provided in Section\\n      98(1).\\n</p>\\n<pre id=\\\"pre_2\\\">      The           order   of      confiscation   is   not   a\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">                             Page 8 of 23</span>\\n R/SCR.A/2185/2018                         JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n</pre><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">      consequential order which must follow the\\n      findings of fact in the case and a duty is cast\\n      on the Court to confiscate anything in respect\\n      of which the offence appears to have been\\n      committed. One should not ignore distinction\\n      made by the Legislature between <a href=\\\"/doc/140622460/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Sections 98(1)</a>\\n      and <a href=\\\"/doc/50179388/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">98(2)</a> of the Bombay Prohibition Act.\\n      Section 98(1) provides for confiscation of\\n      certain things in respect of which an offence\\n      appears to have been committed. In respect of\\n      those things such as intoxicant, hemp, mhowra\\n      flowers, molasses, materials still utensil,\\n      implement or apparatus in respect of which an\\n      offence appears to have been committed they are\\n      straightway to be confiscated. As soon as the\\n      Court comes to the conclusion that in respect\\n      of the articles set out above the offence\\n      appears to have been committed, under the\\n      <a href=\\\"/doc/4377279/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Bombay Prohibition Act</a>, the Court has no option\\n      but to confiscate those articles. Sub-Section\\n      (2) makes a distinct departure in respect of\\n      these things or articles which are not to be\\n      confiscated straightway but which are liable to\\n      confiscation and the things which are liable to\\n      confiscation have to be dealt with as provided\\n      by Section 99. Therefore, in respect of the\\n      things which are not to be confiscated but\\n      which are liable to the confiscation he Court\\n      has to follow the procedure prescribed in\\n      Section99 before the order of confiscation in\\n      respect of such things could be passed. It\\n      cannot, therefore, be said that the order of\\n      confiscation is a mere consequential order\\n      following the findings of fact recorded by the\\n      Court. It may be that a person may be held\\n      guilty of possession of liquor imported in the\\n      motor track and yet the truck need not be\\n      confiscated if it is found that it belongs to\\n      some other person who had exercised due care\\n      for preventing the commission of the offence.\\n      To take a simple illustration, a person in\\n      transport   business  was   approached  with   a\\n      request that the truck is to be hired for\\n      transporting   vegetables   and  while   loading\\n      vegetables a few bottles of liquor were also\\n      loaded. If a search of the truck is taken and\\n      bottles are recovered the person who hired the\\n      truck and transported vegetables would be in\\n      possession of the bottles and would be liable\\n      for   possession   of   liquor.   But  in   such\\n      circumstances, it is unconceivable that the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">                     Page 9 of 23</span>\\n R/SCR.A/2185/2018                        JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n      motor   truck    could  also   be   straightway\\n      confiscated. Therefore, before the motor truck\\n      could be confiscated the Court must make an\\n      inquiry as envisaged by Section 99 and give an\\n      opportunity to the owner of the motor truck to\\n      show that he had exercised due care for\\n      preventing the commission of the offence and if\\n      the Court is satisfied that he had exercised\\n      due care, the truck cannot be confiscated.\\n      Therefore, it cannot be said that in all cases\\n      the order of confiscation is a consequential\\n      order or that there is a duty cast on the Court\\n      to confiscate every article coming before the\\n      Court trying the offences under the Bombay\\n      Prohibition Act. \\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_28\\\">      51 I am unable to agree with the submission of\\n      Mr. A.D. Shah, the learned Amicus Curiae that\\n      the Court should read into <a href=\\\"/doc/1481639/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Section 98(2)</a> of the\\n      Act, 1949, the power of the Magistrate to\\n      release the vehicle in exercise of power under\\n      Sections 451 or 457 of the <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Cr.P.C</a>., as the case\\n      may be, otherwise <a href=\\\"/doc/540119/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Section 99</a> of the Cr.P.C.\\n      would be rendered redundant. In my view, the\\n      entire purpose of the legislation would be\\n      defeated if any other literal construction was\\n      to be adopted. I am in agreement with the\\n      submission of Mr. Raju, the learned Amicus\\n      Curiae that the words during the trial of a\\n      case in <a href=\\\"/doc/1481639/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Section 99</a> of the Act, should not be\\n      construed as at any stage of the trial. In my\\n      view, Mr. Raju, the learned Amicus Curiae, is\\n      right in submitting that <a href=\\\"/doc/1481639/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Section 99</a> of the Act\\n      comes into play when the Court decides to pass\\n      an appropriate order as regards the disposal of\\n      the muddamal property under <a href=\\\"/doc/1289794/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Section 452</a> of the\\n      Code   of   Criminal   Procedure.  Section  452\\n      contemplates   disposal   of  property  at  the\\n      conclusion of the trial and says that when an\\n      inquiry or trial for any Criminal Court is\\n      concluded, the Court may make such order as it\\n      thinks fit for its disposal. This Section 452\\n      refers to a stage when the trial is concluded.\\n      The word inquiry in Section 452 should be\\n      construed as one necessary for the disposal of\\n      the property i.e. confiscation, etc. The word\\n      concluded in Section 452 means, in my opinion,\\n      concluded after a full hearing with a final\\n      judgment for determination of the case against\\n      the accused. For, clearly an order under\\n      Section 452 can be made only on the basis of\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_10\\\">                     Page 10 of 23</span>\\n R/SCR.A/2185/2018                        JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n      the evidence recorded in the inquiry or trial,\\n      and in accordance with the findings, the\\n      Magistrate   may   arrive  at  with   material.\\n      Therefore, Section 99 comes into play on\\n      conclusion of the trial i.e. when the Court\\n      decides to confiscate the vehicle. At that\\n      stage, the Court may conduct a formal inquiry\\n      and in such an inquiry, an opportunity has to\\n      be given to the person claiming the possession\\n      of the vehicle. At that stage, the proviso to\\n      Section 99 comes into play. In accordance with\\n      the proviso, the owner may adduce necessary\\n      evidence to satisfy the Court that he had\\n      exercised due care in preventing the commission\\n      of the offence and although the accused persons\\n      may be held guilty and convicted, yet the\\n      vehicle involved in the commission of the\\n      offence may not be confiscated. There is one\\n      more reason to take this view. In Section 99,\\n      the words are give the owner an option to pay\\n      fine as the Court deems fit in lieu of\\n      confiscation. The question of payment of fine\\n      would come only on conclusion of the trial and\\n      not at an earlier stage.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_29\\\">      65 My final conclusion is that <a href=\\\"/doc/1481639/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Section 98(2)</a> of\\n      the Act, 1949 curtails the power of the\\n      Magistrate to order interim release of the\\n      seized vehicle under Sections 451 or 457 of the\\n      <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Cr.P.C</a>., as the case may be. The Courts below\\n      will have no jurisdiction to order interim\\n      release pending the trial of the seized vehicle\\n      in connection with the offence under the Act,\\n      1949, if the quantity of the liquor recovered\\n      exceeds 10 litres in quantity.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_30\\\">      66 The Legislature in its wisdom has prescribed\\n      a methodology to deal with the prohibition\\n      offences, seizure, confiscation, release, etc.\\n      Once such a procedure is prescribed, the Courts\\n      have to examine the rights of the parties in\\n      accordance with the procedure so prescribed.

It is for this reason, we are of the opinion\\n    that in appropriate cases the High Court is\\n    empowered to entertain the petition under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_48\\\">Article\\n    226</a> of the Constitution of India where the main\\n    relief itself is against arrest. Obviously, when\\n    provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_49\\\">Section 438</a> of Cr.P.C. are not\\n    available to the accused persons in the State of\\n    Uttar Pradesh, under the normal circumstances such\\n    an accused persons would not be entitled to claim\\n    such a relief under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_50\\\">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution. It\\n    cannot be converted into a second window for the\\n    relief which is consciously denied statutorily\\n    making it a case of casus omissus. At the same time,\\n    as rightly observed in para 21 extracted above, the\\n    High Court cannot be completely denuded of its\\n    powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_51\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, to\\n    grant such a relief in appropriate and deserving\\n    cases; albeit this power is to be exercised with\\n    extreme caution and sparingly in those cases where\\n    arrest of a person would lead to total miscarriage\\n    of justice. There may be cases where pre-arrest may\\n    be entirely unwarranted and lead to disastrous\\n    consequences. Whenever the High Court is convinced\\n    of such a situation, it would be appropriate to\\n    grant the relief against pre-arrest in such cases.\\n    What would be those cases will have to be left to\\n    the wisdom of the High Court. What is emphasized is\\n    that the High Court is not bereft of its powers to\\n    grant   this   relief   under   <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_52\\\">Art.   226</a>  of   the\\n    Constitution.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_20\\\">    11. It is pertinent to mention that though the High\\n    Courts have very wide powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_53\\\">Art.226</a>, the very\\n    vastness   of   the   powers  imposes   on  it   the\\n    responsibility to use them with circumspection and\\n    in accordance with the judicial consideration and\\n    well established principles, so much so that while\\n    entertaining writ petitions for granting interim\\n    protection from arrest, the Court would not go on to\\n    the   extent   of   including    the  provision   of\\n    anticipatory bail as a blanket provision.\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_21\\\">                        Page 20 of 23</span>\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_21\\\">     R/SCR.A/2185/2018                       JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_22\\\">   12. Thus, such a power has to be exercised very\\n   cautiously keeping in view, at the same time, that\\n   the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_54\\\">Article 226</a> are a devise to\\n   advance justice and not to frustrate it. The powers\\n   are,   therefore,   to  be   exercised  to    prevent\\n   miscarriage of justice and to prevent abuse of\\n   process of law by authorities indiscriminately\\n   making pre-arrest of the accused persons. In\\n   entertaining such a petition under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_55\\\">Art.226</a>, the High\\n   Court is supposed to balance the two interests. On\\n   the one hand, the Court is to ensure that such a\\n   power under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_56\\\">Art.226</a> is not to be exercised liberally\\n   so as to convert it into <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_57\\\">Section 438</a>,Cr.P.C.\\n   proceedings,   keeping  in   mind  that   when   this\\n   provision is specifically omitted in the State of\\n   Uttar Pradesh, it cannot be resorted to as to back\\n   door entry via <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_58\\\">Art.226.</a> On the other hand, wherever\\n   the High Court finds that in a given case if the\\n   protection against pre-arrest is not given, it would\\n   amount to gross miscarriage of justice and no case,\\n   at all, is made for arrest pending trial, the High\\n   Court would be free to grant the relief in the\\n   nature of anticipatory bail in exercise of its power\\n   under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_59\\\">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution. It is again\\n   clarified that this power has to be exercised\\n   sparingly in those cases where it is absolutely\\n   warranted and justified.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_23\\\">\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_46\\\">27.
