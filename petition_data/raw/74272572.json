In       view       of     the     aforesaid        factual\\nscenario, this Court has noticed that hundreds\\nand thousands of such vehicles are lying either\\nin the compound of the concerned police stations\\nor the said vehicles are being kept in an open\\nground which might have been hired for keeping\\nsuch      vehicles          and        therefore,     such       vehicles\\nremained idle/unutilized and by passage of time,\\nthe value of the vehicles is being diminished.\\nThis Court has also noticed that in view of the\\nbacklog of such cases, the Magistrate Courts are\\nnot equipped with the machinery so as to complete\\nwith    the       trial      and   hearing       within       time   bound\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_4\\\">                                   Page 3 of 9</span>\\n        R/SCR.A/7642/2018                                              JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nschedule but usually, such sort of cases required\\nminimum 4 to 5 years in disposal of such cases\\nand therefore, if the vehicles are kept in that\\nmanner in an open place for about 4 to 5 years,\\nthen    naturally,             the     condition           of        the    vehicle\\nwould be deteriorated and would render useless\\nfor the purpose and thereafter even if it may be\\nconfiscated, then also, it would not fetch any\\nvalue     which            might    have      been       indicated          in    the\\nseizure memo and ultimately, it would be a loss\\nto the public exchequer.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"25703131\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">5.            This Court has also noticed the detailed\\nguidelines <a href=\\\"/doc/50572539/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">laid down by</a> the Honourable Apex Court\\nin     the     celebrated            decision            in     the        case   of\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/25703131/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Sunderbhai          Ambalal         Desai           Vs   State        of    Gujarat</a>\\nreported           in       2003(1)         GLH          307     wherein          the\\nHonourable Apex Court in clear and unequivocal\\nterms directed the Court concerned to hand over\\nthe custody of such vehicles to the persons who\\nare entitled thereto as per the provisions of\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/768169/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">section 451</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\\n1973.</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24458802\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">6.            It        also       appears          that       the    coordinate\\nbench of this Court in various writ petitions\\nwhile        exercising             the      writ         jurisdiction            has\\ngranted interim custody of the vehicles taking\\ninto consideration the decision of the Honourable\\nApex Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/24458802/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Hema Mishra Vs State of\\nUP and others</a>, reported in (2014) 4 SCC 453 and\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">                                      Page 4 of 9</span>\\n       R/SCR.A/7642/2018                                       JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwherein       in          spite     of     clear      embargo      granted\\nanticipatory              bail      in      the      case     under      the\\nprovisions of the Scheduled Casts and Scheduled\\nTribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.                            The Apex\\nCourt, while considering said embargo, held that\\nthe High Court and/or Sessions Court cannot grant\\nthe anticipatory bail under section 438 in view\\nof clear embargo under the Atrocity Act but in\\nappropriate           case,       to     meet      with     the   ends   of\\njustice, while exercising the writ jurisdiction,\\nthe   High        Court       can        grant     anticipatory       bail.\\nRelying upon such interpretation, this High Court\\ngranted interim custody of the vehicles taking it\\nanalogous          interpretation                 though     embargo      is\\nprovided under the Act.</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">7.           Indisputably, the vehicle in question is\\nalleged to have been used in the commission of\\noffence under the provisions of the Act. It is\\npointed out during the course of hearing of the\\npresent matter that at present, in the police\\nstation premises or in open plot hired by the\\nconcerned authority, number of vehicles are kept\\nunattended and vehicles become junk and scrap day\\nby day. It is also worth to note that the offence\\nin question is not being committed by the vehicle\\nbut by the offender who is involved in the case\\ni.e. human being.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">8.           This Court is also conscious of the fact\\nthat to determine degree of guilt or involvement\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">                                    Page 5 of 9</span>\\n      R/SCR.A/7642/2018                                JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor non-involvement or even connivance on the part\\nof the owner of vehicle by this Court would be\\nhazardous to the parties to the proceedings at\\nthe time of trial.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">9.          It     would   be    fruitful     to   refer   to    the\\ndecisions of the Honourable Apex at this stage\\nwhich are as under.\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">            <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"24458802\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">&quot;In <a href=\\\"/doc/24458802/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Hema Mishra Vs. State of U.P. and\\n            others</a> (2014) 4 SCC 453, the Apex Court\\n            was called upon to decide a very\\n            important question as regards the power\\n            of the High Court under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Article - 226</a> of\\n            the Constitution of India vis-a-vis non-\\n            applicability of <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Section 438</a> of the\\n            Criminal Procedure Code in the State of\\n            U.P.

I may, however, point out that there is\\n            unanimity in the view that in spite of the fact\\n            that Section 438 has been specifically omitted\\n            and made inapplicable in the State of Uttar\\n            Pradesh, still a party aggrieved can invoke the\\n            jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Article\\n            226</a> of the Constitution of India, being\\n            extraordinary jurisdiction and the vastness of\\n            the   powers   naturally  impose   considerable\\n            responsibility in its application. All the\\n            same, the High Court has got the power and\\n            sometimes duty in appropriate cases to grant\\n            reliefs, though it is not possible to pin-point\\n            what are the appropriate cases, which have to\\n            be left to the wisdom of the Court exercising\\n            powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\\n            India.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">            His Lordship Justice A.K.Sikri in his\\n            separate    but    concurring judgment\\n            observed as under;\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_10\\\">                                Page 6 of 9</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\"> R/SCR.A/7642/2018                         JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\n\\n       &quot;4. It is for this reason, we are of the\\n       opinion that in appropriate cases the High\\n       Court is empowered to entertain the petition\\n       under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India\\n       where the main relief itself is against arrest.\\n       Obviously, when provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Section 438</a> of\\n       Cr.P.C. are not available to the accused\\n       persons in the State of Uttar Pradesh, under\\n       the   normal  circumstances   such  an  accused\\n       persons would not be entitled to claim such a\\n       relief under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Art. 226</a> of the Constitution. It\\n       cannot be converted into a second window for\\n       the   relief   which   is   consciously  denied\\n       statutorily making it a case of casus omissus.\\n       At the same time, as rightly observed in para\\n       21 extracted above, the High Court cannot be\\n       completely denuded of its powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Article\\n       226</a> of the Constitution, to grant such a relief\\n       in appropriate and deserving cases; albeit this\\n       power is to be exercised with extreme caution\\n       and sparingly in those cases where arrest of a\\n       person would lead to total miscarriage of\\n       justice. There may be cases where pre-arrest\\n       may be entirely unwarranted and lead to\\n       disastrous consequences. Whenever the High\\n       Court is convinced of such a situation, it\\n       would be appropriate to grant the relief\\n       against pre-arrest in such cases. What would be\\n       those cases will have to be left to the wisdom\\n       of the High Court. What is emphasized is that\\n       the High Court is not bereft of its powers to\\n       grant this relief under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">Art. 226</a> of the\\n       Constitution.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">       11. It is pertinent to mention that though the\\n       High Courts have very wide powers under\\n       <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">Art.226</a>, the very vastness of the powers\\n       imposes on it the responsibility to use them\\n       with circumspection and in accordance with the\\n       judicial consideration and well established\\n       principles, so much so that while entertaining\\n       writ petitions for granting interim protection\\n       from arrest, the Court would not go on to the\\n       extent   of    including   the   provision  of\\n       anticipatory bail as a blanket provision.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">       12. Thus, such a power has to be exercised very\\n       cautiously keeping in view, at the same time,\\n       that the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Article 226</a> are a devise\\n       to advance justice and not to frustrate it.

In   entertaining  such   a\\n             petition under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">Art.226</a>, the High Court is\\n             supposed to balance the two interests. On the\\n             one hand, the Court is to ensure that such a\\n             power under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_25\\\">Art.226</a> is not to be exercised\\n             liberally so as to convert it into <a href=\\\"/doc/1783708/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">Section\\n             438</a>,Cr.P.C. proceedings, keeping in mind that\\n             when this provision is specifically omitted in\\n             the State of Uttar Pradesh, it cannot be\\n             resorted to as to back door entry via <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_27\\\">Art.226.</a>\\n             On the other hand, wherever the High Court\\n             finds that in a given case if the protection\\n             against pre-arrest is not given, it would\\n             amount to gross miscarriage of justice and no\\n             case, at all, is made for arrest pending trial,\\n             the High Court would be free to grant the\\n             relief in the nature of anticipatory bail in\\n             exercise of its power under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_28\\\">Art. 226</a> of the\\n             Constitution.
