For the Petitioners in the present writ petitions, it is not the first\\n time that they are litigating before this Court. In some cases, there\\n have been at least two earlier rounds of litigation. The present\\n batch of writ petitions has several common features. In all of them,\\n the Petitioners are questioning the powers of the Assistant\\n Settlement Officer (ASO), an authority functioning under the\\n <a href=\\\"/doc/136811253/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Orissa Survey and Settlement Act, 1958</a> (OSS Act), to purportedly\\n exercise suo motu powers at the stage of a preliminary publication\\n of a draft record of rights (ROR) under Section 12 of OSS Act and\\n to pass orders directing that the lands in question be recorded in the\\n name of the Government in the ROR.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\"> 3. Another common feature of all these cases is that the lands in\\n question are in Khurda District either in the city of Bhubaneswar or\\n in its outskirts. The litigation has its genesis in an order passed by\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">                                                              Page 9 of 20</span>\\n the Division Bench of this Court on 29th January 1996 in OJC\\nNo.9449 of 1993 noting the allegations made about irregularities\\ncommitted in the grant of leases of land in Bhubaneswar Tahsil\\narea; and directing the State Government to scrutinize all irregular\\nlease cases and thereafter take appropriate action. Those leases\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Orissa Government Land Settlement Act, 1962</a> <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">(OGLS\\nAct</a>) were granted in favour of either the Petitioners themselves or\\ntheir vendors and their predecessors-in-interest.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">4. On the basis of the above general direction issued by this Court\\nin OJC No.9449 of 1993, orders came be passed in purported\\nexercise of suo motu powers by ASOs at the stage of examining the\\napplications for mutation of the names of the purchasers in the\\nRORs. Many of these purchasers had purchased the land in\\nquestion through registered sale deeds (RSDs) and were asking for\\nconsequential entry of their names in the ROR on the basis of such\\nRSDs.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">5. Pursuant to the directions issued by this Court in OJC No. 9449\\nof 1993, action was sought to be taken under the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">OGLS Act</a> to\\ncancel the leases. At that stage, writ petitions were filed in this\\nCourt in which orders were passed remanding the matters to the\\nAdditional District Magistrate (ADM) to examine, after hearing the\\nPetitioners, whether in fact leases hadbeen granted validly in their\\nfavour. The Court is informed that in some of these cases, on such\\nremand, the ADM again passed orders affirming the grant of lease\\nin favour of the Petitioners or their vendors or the predecessors-in-\\ninterest. The grievance is that even in such cases where the ADM\\nhad confirmed the grant of leases in favour of the predecessors-in-\\n</p>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_2\\\">                                                        Page 10 of 20</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\"> interest of the Petitioners, the ASOs at the stage of examining the\\nrequest for mutation in the ROR, again exercised purported suo\\nmotu power to decline such registration of ROR and issued positive\\ndirections that they should in fact be recorded in the name of the\\nGovernment. This has triggered the present round of litigation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">6. This Court has been shown numerous orders passed by both the\\nlearned Single Judge of this Court as well as various Division\\nBenches where in similar circumstances, it has been repeatedly\\nheld that the ASOs exercising powers under the OSS Act are bound\\nby the orders passed by the ADM under the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">OGLS Act</a> and cannot\\npossibly override such orders.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"172522694\\\" id=\\\"span_3\\\">7. Among the earliest of such orders is an order dated 20th August,\\n2013 passed by a Division Bench of this Court in W.P.(C)\\nNo.18936 of 2013 (<a href=\\\"/doc/172522694/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Mrs. Sneha Mohanty v.

Then there are a series of orders passed by the Division Benches\\nof this Court in 2014 including an order dated 4th July 2014 in W.P.\\n(C) No.8402 of 2014 (<a href=\\\"/doc/64268363/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">Nilendri Mohanty v.

State of Odisha</a>), where it was held as\\nunder:</span></span>\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">         &quot;The leases having been granted either under the\\n         <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">OGLS Act</a> or under any other appropriate law, unless\\n         and until it is set aside or declared invalid by the\\n         competent authority under the appropriate statute the\\n         lease cannot be said to be invalid. Unless and until the\\n         lease is either set aside or leasehold lands are resumed\\n         by the order of the competent authority, the Assistant\\n         Settlement Officer/Settlement authorities are bound\\n         by the lease orders and have no jurisdiction to\\n         question the validity of the lease concerned. For the\\n         omission of the State Government to scrutinize and to\\n         find out any irregularities in respect of any lease, no\\n         fault can be imputed either to the lessees or to the\\n         petitioner, who have purchased by registered sale\\n         deeds portions of such leasehold lands. Since the\\n         Assistant Settlement Officer was in seisin of the\\n         matter, it was incumbent on him to make field\\n         enquiry to find out the actual possession of the\\n         petitioners and he having not done so it is not open to\\n         him to doubt about the possession of the petitioners\\n         over the lands which they claimed and on that ground\\n         direct recording of the land in favour of the State.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">9. In many of the above cases, the matters were remanded to the\\nASO to again examine the matters and pass appropriate orders.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">10. Then there are a series of orders that were passed by the\\nDivision Benches of this Court in 2018. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"17673189\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">In W.P.(C) No.12776 of\\n2014 (<a href=\\\"/doc/17673189/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Padmanav Prusty v.

It was then observed as under:</span>\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">        &quot;10. ... It must be made clear that it was none of the\\n        business of the Assistant Settlement Officer to go into\\n        the question of correctness of lease and direct to\\n        change the draft record because the authority under\\n        the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">OGLS Act</a>, lease principle or <a href=\\\"/doc/1625086/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Government Grants\\n        Act</a> under which there are hierarchy of authorities to\\n        take cognizance of any irregularity and illegality and\\n        then pass the order of cancellation under the\\n        concerned statute. The Assistant Settlement Officer is\\n        not authorized to encroach upon the authority as\\n        prescribed under other revenue laws to behave like\\n        appellate authority to cancel the lease. On the other\\n        hand, the impugned order passed by the Assistant\\n        Settlement Officer is without jurisdiction and wholly\\n        erroneous. Similarly, the Additional Sub-Collector,\\n        without mentioning the provision of law under which\\n        he heard the appeal, has dismissed the appeal and as\\n        such, the same is also without jurisdiction and illegal.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_3\\\">        <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1802196\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">11.

On the\\n        other hand, in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1802196/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Babu Verghese and others\\n        v.

A similar matter, i.e.,\\n        W.P.(C) No.2207 of 2015 (Rukmani Panigrahi v.\\n        State of Orissa) has also been disposed by this Court\\n        on 13.07.2015 with the finding that the Assistant\\n        Settlement Officer cannot dispose of such matter\\n        while being only authorized to prepare the final\\n        record of right in accordance with the draft record of\\n        right (PARCHA).

Act</a>. There is ample provision under the\\n        <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_31\\\">O.G.L.S. Act</a> to cancel the lease granted in favour of\\n        beneficiary and in fact, the said settlements had\\n        undergone the test of its validity. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"19756990\\\" id=\\\"span_20\\\">It appears from the\\n        impugned orders that the Assistant Settlement\\n        Officer/Addl. Sub-Collector conveniently avoided the\\n        settlement made under the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_32\\\">O.G.L.S. Act</a> by ignoring\\n        the same, which is not permissible under law. The\\n        impugned orders have, in effect, resulted in cancelling\\n        the lease granted in favour of beneficiary, which is\\n        not within the domain of the settlement authorities.\\n        My view gets support from the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/19756990/\\\" id=\\\"a_33\\\">Lily Nanda v.\\n        State of Odisha</a> reported in 2018 (I) OLR 559. As\\n        such, the impugned orders are without jurisdiction\\n        and the same are void. The action taken or publication\\n        made pursuant to the said void orders are also equally\\n        ineffective and no nest in the eyes of law. Thus, final\\n        publication of the R.O.Rs. under <a href=\\\"/doc/1353758/\\\" id=\\\"a_34\\\">Section 12-B</a> of the\\n        Act, 1958 pursuant to the void orders is not\\n        sustainable in the eyes of law.&quot;</span>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\">13. The learned Single Judge in the above judgment went so far as\\nto say that even if such order of the ASO under the OSS Act had\\nresulted in a final publication of the ROR under Section 12- B of\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_21\\\">                                                       Page 16 of 20</span>\\n the OSS Act that would not be sustainable in the eye of law.\\nConsequently, even the RORs published pursuant to the final list\\nwere set aside. The matters were remitted to the authorities under\\nthe OSS Act for a fresh a adjudication in accordance with law after\\ngiving an opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_21\\\">14. At one stage of the arguments in the present cases, a question\\narose whether in many of these cases there had been a final\\npublication of the list as envisaged in Rule 29 of the Orissa Survey\\nand Settlement Rules, 1962 (OSS Rules)? That was because in\\nterms of Section 13 of the OSS Act, the final publication of the list\\nlends a presumption of correctness to every entry made on the\\nROR and the remedy for a person aggrieved by such entry in the\\nfinal list published under Section 13 of the OSS Act is to prefer a\\nrevision petition under Section 15(b) of the OSS Act before the\\nBoard of Revenue. Where there is no such final publication of list,\\nand an order has been passed by an ASO at the stage of publication\\nof the draft ROR under Section 12 of the OSS Act, the remedy lies\\nby way of an appeal under Section 12-A of the OSS Act.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_22\\\">15. In some of the cases before us, such appeals were in fact filed\\nand rejected by the Appellate Authority under Section 12-A of the\\nOSS Act perhaps on the ground that in the meanwhile a final list\\nhad been published. However, the position is not very clear from\\nthe pleadings in these writ petitions. Therefore, two scenarios can\\npossibly emerge i.e., one where there has been a final publication\\nof the ROR in terms of Section 13 of the OSS Act read with Rule\\n29 of the OSS Rules and another where there has been no such\\nfinal publication of the ROR. Nevertheless in both scenarios, a\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_22\\\">                                                        Page 17 of 20</span>\\n common feature, as already noticed, in all these writ petitions is\\nthat ASOs have passed orders declining the request of the\\nPetitioners for recording their names in the ROR in respect of the\\nland in question. It must be noted at this stage that in all these writ\\npetitions while issuing notice, this Court had directed status quo to\\nbe maintained and that interim order has continued. In most of\\nthese writ petitions, no counter affidavits have been filed despite\\nthe petitions having been pending over 8 years now.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_23\\\">16. Be that as it may, it is plain that in all these cases, the ASOs\\nexercised &#x27;suo motu powers&#x27; to override the orders of the ADM\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_35\\\">OGLS Act</a> in favour of the predecessors-in-interest of the\\nPetitioners or refused to record their names in the ROR despite\\nthere being no objections to the draft publication of the ROR.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_24\\\">17. Clearly the ASOs were acting without jurisdiction and beyond\\nthe scope of their powers under the OSS Act. It is obvious that\\npowers which could have been exercised only under the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_36\\\">OGLS Act</a>\\nwere sought to be exercised by the ASO which was impermissible\\nin law for them to do. The above extracted portions of the orders of\\nthis Court conclusively settle the legal position in this regard and\\ndo not bear repetition.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_25\\\">18. The question that next arises is what should be the\\nconsequential orders passed by this Court consequent upon the\\nsetting aside of all such orders of the ASOs and the Appellate\\nAuthorities under the OSS Act, which are without jurisdiction. One\\ncourse of action, as has been done in some of the cases, is to\\nremand the matters to the ASO for a fresh decision by following\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_23\\\">                                                          Page 18 of 20</span>\\n the law and the correct legal procedure. However, that course does\\nnot commend itself to this Court for the simple reason that there\\nhave been at least two rounds of litigations already involving these\\nvery Petitioners and their lands in question. Remanding the matters\\nwould only multiply litigation when the legal position is already\\nclear. If the Government seeks to recover land which it believes\\nbelongs to the Government, then there are enough provisions under\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_37\\\">OGLS Act</a> to take care of such contingencies. For instance\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/171651069/\\\" id=\\\"a_38\\\">Section 3-B</a> of the OGLS Act provides for resumption of land and\\nimposition of penalty. The Rules made under the <a href=\\\"/doc/8398580/\\\" id=\\\"a_39\\\">OGLS Act</a> set out\\nthe detailed procedure for exercise of such powers. In other words,\\nthe Government is not powerless or remediless in such a\\ncontingency. There is no need for an ASO exercising limited\\npowers under the OSS Act to take up on himself or herself the task\\nof seeking to recover Government land when there are no such\\npowers vested in the ASO under the OSS Act.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_26\\\">19. In that view of the matter, the following directions are issued in\\nall these writ petitions:\\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_8\\\">(i) The impugned orders of the ASOs declining to accept the\\nrequest of the Petitioners for recording of their names in the ROR\\nin respect of the lands in question on the ground that the land\\nbelongs to the Government, are hereby set aside;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_9\\\">(ii) The corresponding orders by the Appellate Authorities\\naffirming such orders of the ASOs are also hereby set aside;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_24\\\">                                                         Page 19 of 20</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_10\\\">                  (iii) A direction is issued to the ASOs to now proceed to record the\\n                 names of the respective Petitioners concerning the land in question\\n                 in their names in the ROR, in accordance with law within a period\\n                 of eight weeks.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_11\\\">                 (iv) Where the land in question stands recorded in the final\\n                 published RoR in the name of the Government that entry will stand\\n                 cancelled by virtue of this order and the ASO will proceed to\\n                 record it in favour of the respective Petitioners.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">                 20. The above directions will be carried out within a period of four\\n                 months from today.
