Brief facts of the case which are necessary for the adjudication of\\n\\npresent case are that the petitioner was issued passport on 22.08.2005\\n\\n\\n                               2 of 36\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">            ::: Downloaded on - 19-07-2023 02:03:42 :::</span>\\n                                                     Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:088633\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCWP-27167 of 2018                  -3- 2023:PHHC:088633\\nand all connected cases\\nwhich expired on 21.08.2015. An FIR dated 13.03.2008 under <a href=\\\"/doc/1727139/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">NDPS Act</a>\\n\\ncame to be registered against him. The trial court vide judgment dated\\n\\n09.10.2013 convicted the petitioner under <a href=\\\"/doc/1046310/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Section 15</a> of NDPS Act and\\n\\nsentenced to imprisonment of 10 years. The petitioner assailing judgment\\n\\nof conviction and order of sentence preferred an appeal CRA-S-3725-SB\\n\\nof 2013 before this Court which came to be admitted vide order dated\\n\\n25.11.2013. The sentence of the petitioner came to be suspended vide\\n\\norder dated 14.02.2017 passed by this Court.               The petitioner on\\n\\n07.07.2017 moved an application seeking renewal of his passport. The\\n\\npetitioner was informed vide communication dated 17.07.2017 that there\\n\\nis an adverse police report. The application of the petitioner came to be\\n\\nclosed. The petitioner, in the pending appeal, preferred an application\\n\\nbefore this Court, seeking direction to respondents to renew his passport\\n\\nwhich came to be dismissed vide order dated 25.09.2018. The application\\n\\nwas dismissed observing that relief sought for by petitioner is civil in\\n\\nnature and in case of denial of his application, he has remedy to file civil\\n\\nwrit petition.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">Contention of the Petitioner:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">4.

As per Clause (e) of <a href=\\\"/doc/1780385/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Section 6(2)</a> of the 1967 Act,\\n\\npassport authority may issue passport if an applicant is convicted five\\n\\nyears prior to the date of application or sentence is less than two years.

Mr. Maninder Singh, DAG, Punjab submits that petitioner\\n\\nwas convicted vide judgment dated 09.10.2013 passed by Special Court,\\n\\nKapurthala.

This doctrine of\\n             equality before the law is a necessary corollary to the high\\n             concept of the rule of law accepted by our Constitution. One\\n             of the aspects of rule of law is that every executive action, if\\n             it is to operate to the prejudice of any person, must be\\n             supported by some legislative authority: see State of Madhya\\n             Pradesh v.Thakur Bharat Singh [ Civil Appeal No. 1066 of\\n             1965 (decided on 23-1-1967)] . Secondly, such a law would\\n\\n\\n                                5 of 36\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">             ::: Downloaded on - 19-07-2023 02:03:42 :::</span>\\n                                                   Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:088633\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCWP-27167 of 2018                   -6- 2023:PHHC:088633\\nand all connected cases\\n            be void, if it discriminates or enables an authority to\\n            discriminate between persons without just classification.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">            What a legislature could not do, the executive could not\\n            obviously do. But in the present case the executive claims a\\n            right to issue a passport at its discretion; that is to say, it\\n            can at its discretion prevent a person from leaving India on\\n            foreign travel. Whether the right to travel is part of personal\\n            liberty or not within the meaning of <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Article 21</a> of the\\n            Constitution, such an arbitrary prevention of a person from\\n            travelling abroad will certainly affect him prejudicially. A\\n            person may like to go abroad for many reasons. He may like\\n            to see the world, to study abroad, to undergo medical\\n            treatment that is not available in our country, to collaborate\\n            in scientific research, to develop his mental horizon in\\n            different fields and such others. An executive arbitrariness\\n            can prevent one from doing so and permit another to travel\\n            merely for pleasure. While in the case of enacted law one\\n            knows where he stands, in the case of unchannelled arbitrary\\n            discretion, discrimination is writ large on the face of it. Such\\n            a discretion patently violates the doctrine of equality, for the\\n            difference in the treatment of persons rests solely on the\\n            arbitrary selection of the executive. The argument that the\\n            said discretionary power of the State is a political or a\\n            diplomatic one does not make it anytheless an executive\\n            power. We, therefore, hold that the order refusing to issue\\n            the passport to the petitioner offends <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Article 14</a> of the\\n            Constitution.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_15\\\">9.

The court though upheld validity of\\n\\ndifferent provisions of the Act, yet, made such observations which were\\n\\nhaving far reaching repercussions. The findings though were made with\\n\\n                              6 of 36\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">           ::: Downloaded on - 19-07-2023 02:03:42 :::</span>\\n                                                    Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:088633\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n CWP-27167 of 2018                -7- 2023:PHHC:088633\\nand all connected cases\\nrespect to <a href=\\\"/doc/83644/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Section 10(3)</a> of the 1967 Act, yet, are relevant for the\\n\\nadjudication of present batch of matters, thus reproduced as below:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_8\\\">            <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1747577\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">25. There is also another consideration which leads to the\\n            same conclusion.

We may begin the discussion of this question by first\\n            considering the nature and significance of the right to go\\n            abroad. It cannot be disputed that there must exist a\\n            basically free sphere for man, resulting from the nature and\\n            dignity of the human being as the bearer of the highest\\n            spiritual and moral values. This basic freedom of the human\\n            being is expressed at various levels and is reflected in\\n            various basic rights. Freedom to go abroad is one of such\\n            rights, for the nature of man as a free agent necessarily\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_17\\\">                               7 of 36\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_11\\\">            ::: Downloaded on - 19-07-2023 02:03:42 :::</span>\\n                                                   Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:088633\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCWP-27167 of 2018                  -8- 2023:PHHC:088633\\nand all connected cases\\n            involves free movement on his part. There can be no doubt\\n           that if the purpose and the sense of the State is to protect\\n           personality and its development, as indeed it should be of\\n           any liberal democratic State, freedom to go abroad must be\\n           given its due place amongst the basic rights. This right is an\\n           important basic human right for it nourishes independent\\n           and self-determining creative character of the individual, not\\n           only by extending his freedoms of action, but also by\\n           extending the scope of his experience. It is a right which\\n           gives intellectual and creative workers in particular the\\n           opportunity of extending their spiritual and intellectual\\n           horizon through study at foreign universities, through\\n           contact with foreign colleagues and through participation in\\n           discussions and conferences. The right also extends to\\n           private life; marriage, family and friendship are humanities\\n           which can be rarely affected through refusal of freedom to\\n           go abroad and clearly show that this freedom is a genuine\\n           human right. Moreover, this freedom would be a highly\\n           valuable right where man finds himself obliged to flee : (a)\\n           because he is unable to serve his God as he wished at the\\n           previous place of residence, (b) because his personal\\n           freedom is threatened for reasons which do not constitute a\\n           crime in the usual meaning of the word and many were such\\n           cases during the emergency, or (c) because his life is\\n           threatened either for religious or political reasons or\\n           through the threat to the maintenance of minimum standard\\n           of living compatible with human dignity. These reasons\\n           suggest that freedom to go abroad incorporates the\\n           important function of anultimum refunium libertatiswhen\\n           other basic freedoms are refused.

The controversy in the present case relates to\\n           interpretation of the provisions of Clauses (e) and (f) of\\n           <a href=\\\"/doc/2435/\\\" id=\\\"a_78\\\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Passports Act and the notification dated\\n           25.08.1993 issued by the Central Government. Respondent\\n           no. 1 and respondent no. 3 have taken somewhat divergent\\n           stands. According to respondent no. 1, the petitioner would\\n           not be entitled to a passport by virtue of Clauses (e) and (f)\\n           of <a href=\\\"/doc/2435/\\\" id=\\\"a_79\\\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Passports Act.

It is contended that the petitioner&#x27;s appeal before\\n           this Court (Crl.

Clearly,\\n           the said clause is inapplicable where the criminal\\n           proceedings have culminated in a conviction and the offence\\n           alleged to have been committed has been established.\\n           Plainly, in such circumstances, the offence cannot be\\n           described as &quot;alleged to have been committed&quot;. Clause (e)\\n           of <a href=\\\"/doc/2435/\\\" id=\\\"a_83\\\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Act relates to a case where an\\n           applicant has been convicted of an offence involving moral\\n           turpitude and has been sentenced in respect thereof to an\\n           imprisonment for not less than two years.

There is merit in respondent no. 3&#x27;s contention that in\\n           case of the petitioner the matter has travelled beyond the\\n           stage of a mere allegation. Although the petitioner has\\n           preferred an appeal against his conviction, this Court has\\n           not passed any order staying the same. Thus, as it stands\\n           today, the petitioner stands convicted of an offence involving\\n           moral turpitude and has been sentenced to undergo\\n           imprisonment for a period of three years. In the aforesaid\\n           view, the notification dated 25.08.1993 has no application.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_48\\\">           21.

In view of the above,\\n            this Court finds no infirmity with the decision of respondent\\n            no. 1 to deny the petitioner the facility of passport. However,\\n            the reference to the notification dated 25.08.1993 in the\\n            impugned order is misplaced.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_49\\\">            <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"43475503\\\" id=\\\"span_27\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"1747577\\\" id=\\\"span_28\\\">22.

This is without merit. Although, the petitioner has a\\n            right to a passport, the same is circumscribed by the\\n            provisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/229269/\\\" id=\\\"a_88\\\">Passport Act</a>.
