A plain reading of the impugned Explanations\\n         in Notification Nos.20 of 2021 and 38 of 2021 shows that it\\n         purports to &quot;clarify&quot; that the unamended provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/105210795/\\\" id=\\\"a_165\\\">Sections\\n         147</a> to <a href=\\\"/doc/37318895/\\\" id=\\\"a_166\\\">151</a> of the Act will apply for the purposes of issue of\\n         notices under <a href=\\\"/doc/193234472/\\\" id=\\\"a_167\\\">Section 148</a> of the Act, which is clearly ultra vires\\n         Relaxation Act.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_91\\\">         41. In our view, the reopening notices issued after 1 st April,\\n         2021 are unsustainable and bad in law even if one was to\\n         apply the Explanations to the Notification Nos.20 of 2021 and\\n         38 of 2021. The Explanation seeks to extend the applicability of\\n         erstwhile <a href=\\\"/doc/193234472/\\\" id=\\\"a_168\\\">Sections 148</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/147549546/\\\" id=\\\"a_169\\\">149</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/37318895/\\\" id=\\\"a_170\\\">151</a>. The impugned\\n         Explanation does not cover <a href=\\\"/doc/105210795/\\\" id=\\\"a_171\\\">Section 147</a>, which (as amended)\\n         empowers the revenue to reopen an assessment subject to\\n         <a href=\\\"/doc/193234472/\\\" id=\\\"a_172\\\">Sections 148</a> to <a href=\\\"/doc/103946234/\\\" id=\\\"a_173\\\">153</a>, which includes Section 148A.

It   would       therefore   be      legitimate         in\\n              interpreting sub-section (2) to consider that was the\\n              mischief and defect for which <a href=\\\"/doc/156301334/\\\" id=\\\"a_402\\\">section 52</a> as it then\\n              stood did not provide and which was sought to be\\n              remedied by the enactment of sub-section (2) or in\\n              other words, what was the object and purpose of\\n              enacting that sub-section. Now in this connection the\\n              speech made by the Finance Minister while moving the\\n              amendment introducing sub-section (2) is extremely\\n              relevant, as it throws considerable light on the object\\n              and purpose of the enactment or sub-section (2). The\\n              Finance Minister explained the reason for introducing\\n              sub-section (2) in the following words:\\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_95\\\">                    &quot;Today, particularly every transaction of the sale\\n                    of property is for a much lower figure than what\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_223\\\">                                 Page 112 of 205</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_224\\\">                                                           Downloaded on : Sun Sep 17 21:34:21 IST 2023</span>\\n                                                                                         NEUTRAL CITATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC/SCA/17321/2022                                     CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/02/2023\\n\\n                                                                                         undefined\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                    is actually received.

It is apparent from\\n              the speech of the Finance Minister that sub-section(2)\\n              was enacted for the purpose of reaching those cases\\n              where there was understatement of consideration in\\n              respect of the transfer or to put it differently, the\\n              actual consideration received for the transfer was\\n              &#x27;considerably more&#x27; than that declared or shown by the\\n              assessee, but which were not covered by sub- section\\n              (1) because the transferee was not directly or indirectly\\n              connected with the assessee.

Even under <a href=\\\"/doc/41273274/\\\" id=\\\"a_457\\\">Section 50</a>,\\n      we do not see any provision which specifically authorises the\\n      State Government to make any such rules in the nature of the\\n      proviso to Rule 5 of the State Rules. It is an established\\n      principle that the power to make rules under an Act is\\n      derived from the enabling provision found in such Act.\\n      Therefore, it is fundamental that a delegate on whom such\\n      power is conferred has to act within the limits of the\\n      authority conferred by the Act and it cannot enlarge the\\n      scope of the Act. A delegate cannot override the Act either\\n      by exceeding the authority or by making provision which is\\n      inconsistent with the Act. Any Rule made in exercise of such\\n      delegated power has to be in consonance with the provisions\\n      of the Act, and if the Rule goes beyond what the Act\\n      contemplates, the Rule becomes in excess of the power\\n      delegated under the Act, and if it does any of the above, the\\n      Rule becomes ultra vires of the Act. We have already noticed\\n      that none of the provisions of the Act has contemplated any\\n      power to be vested in the State officers to recompute the\\n      agricultural income from tea while proviso to Rule 5 of the\\n      Rules in specific terms empowers the State officers to\\n      recompute the agricultural income from tea different from\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_261\\\">                            Page 127 of 205</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_262\\\">                                                     Downloaded on : Sun Sep 17 21:34:21 IST 2023</span>\\n                                                                                  NEUTRAL CITATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC/SCA/17321/2022                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 07/02/2023\\n\\n                                                                                  undefined\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      that which is computed by the Central officers under the\\n      Central Act.

Even under <a href=\\\"/doc/41273274/\\\" id=\\\"a_816\\\">Section 50</a>, we do\\n              not see any provision which specifically authorises\\n              the State Government to make any such rules in the\\n              nature of the proviso to Rule 5 of the State Rules.\\n              It is an established principle that the power to\\n              make rules under an Act is derived from the\\n              enabling provision found in such Act. Therefore, it\\n              is fundamental that a delegate on whom such power\\n              is conferred has to act within the limits of the\\n              authority conferred by the Act and it cannot enlarge\\n              the scope of the Act. A delegate cannot override the\\n              Act either by exceeding the authority or by making\\n              provision which is inconsistent with the Act. Any\\n              Rule made in exercise of such delegated power has\\n              to be in consonance with the provisions of the Act,\\n              and if the Rule goes beyond what the Act\\n              contemplates, the Rule becomes in excess of the\\n              power delegated under the Act, and if it does any\\n              of the above, the Rule becomes ultra vires of the\\n              Act. We have already noticed that none of the\\n              provisions of the Act has contemplated any power\\n              to be vested in the State officers to recompute the\\n              agricultural income from tea while proviso to Rule\\n              5 of the Rules in specific terms empowers the State\\n              officers to recompute the agricultural income from\\n              tea different from that which is computed by the\\n              Central officers under the Central Act. Thus, it is\\n              seen that this Rule is not only made beyond the\\n              rule-making power of the State under <a href=\\\"/doc/41273274/\\\" id=\\\"a_817\\\">Section 50</a> of\\n              the Act but also runs counter to the object of the\\n              Act itself, and enlarges the scope of the Act.
