Most of the Petitions in this group were filed assailing the levy\\nof stamp duty on Bills of Entry for clearance of goods from the\\ncustoms areas. Thus, all these Petitions only deal with imports.\\nSome of the Petitions have been amended or were filed to include a\\nchallenge to the levy of stamp duty on Delivery Orders.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_2\\\">2.     Dr Saraf, learned Advocate General, clarifies that the State\\nGovernment is not levying duty on Bills of Entry but only on\\nDelivery Orders. He has some submissions to make in regard to how\\nthis is entirely legitimate, permissible and necessary under the\\nrelevant provisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/140940389/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958</a> (&quot;the\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/140940389/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Stamp Act</a>&quot;).\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">                              Page 25 of 30</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_3\\\">                             1st March 2023\\n                                               910-912-OSWP3884-2021+.DOC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"185087565\\\" id=\\\"span_2\\\">3.    He further points out that previous interim or ad-interim\\norders were obtained on the basis inter alia of a decision of a\\nDivision Bench of the Gujarat High Court in the <a href=\\\"/doc/185087565/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">State of Gujarat vs\\nReliance Industries Ltd.1 That</a> decision is carried in appeal to the\\nSupreme Court where it is apparently pending. The Gujarat\\ndecision dealt with Bills of Entry and, in our very early order of 15th\\nDecember 2021, we noted this when we granted interim relief. We\\nalso noted that the Supreme Court had declined to stay the order of\\nthe Gujarat High Court. The decision of the Gujarat High Court\\nwas clearly whether stamp duty was liable to be paid on a Bill of\\nEntry and whether a Bill of Entry constituted an &#x27;instrument&#x27; or\\ndocument by which any right or liability is inter alia created or\\nrecorded in relation to the entitlement for delivery of goods. Part of\\nthe question framed in paragraph 4 is whether the Bill of Entry is\\nitself tantamount to a delivery order. The Division Bench held that\\nno stamp duty was or could be levied on a Bill of Entry.</span>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">4.    Dr Saraf has been at some pains to point out that the levy of\\nstamp on a delivery order is a distinct levy contemplated inter alia\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/1888152/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Article 29</a> of the <a href=\\\"/doc/140940389/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">First Schedule to the Stamp Act</a>. He has\\nadditionally other arguments to present in that behalf.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">5.    As the first order of business, whether or not there is an\\nInterim Application, we permit an amendment to all Petitions to\\ninclude a challenge to the levy of stamp on delivery orders. The\\nnecessary amendments are to be carried out without need of\\nreverification by 10th March 2023.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">1     2011 SCC Online Guj 5032.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_3\\\">                             Page 26 of 30</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">                             1st March 2023\\n                                                910-912-OSWP3884-2021+.DOC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">6.    The question then remains not about continuing the previous\\nad-interim order staying the levy of stamp duty on Bills of Entry\\n(which will not arise in view of Dr Saraf&#x27;s statement today) but of\\nexpanding this or substituting it to stay of the levy of stamp duty on\\ndelivery orders.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">7.    Some of the Petitioners submit that they propose to argue\\nthat an unconditional stay, and subject only to the Petitioners&#x27;\\nundertaking, should continue or be made in respect of delivery\\norders. Ex facie that appears to us to be a difficult proposition to\\naccept. Stamp duty is a taxing or a fiscal measure under a dedicated\\nstatute. The payment is into revenue. Merely saying, as some\\nPetitioners do, that they do not trust the Government is a less than\\npersuasive argument. The remedies to that lie elsewhere and not in\\na Writ Court.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">8.    We are prepared to make a formal order that the Petitioners\\nmay pay and will be deemed to have paid the stamp duty on a\\ndelivery order as a payment under protest and without prejudice;\\nbut pay they must. We are also prepared to state that should the\\nPetitioners succeed, they will be entitled to return or refund of the\\namount and even possibly such interest as the Court may determine.\\nBut we are unprepared to accept a simple undertaking from the\\nPetitioners that if the Petitions fail, they will then be liable to pay the\\nstamp duty. The reason is self-evident. If these goods are cleared\\nout of customs without payment of stamp duty, and only on an\\nundertaking, then the Petitioners are gone, the goods are gone and\\nthe State Government and stamp authorities are left with no remedy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_4\\\">                               Page 27 of 30</span>\\n                              1st March 2023\\n                                               910-912-OSWP3884-2021+.DOC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nor recourse. They may not know where to find these Petitioners or\\nhow to recover the amount assessed. Any recovery will be a long\\ndrawn process. We do not see why that should be. We are unable to\\nsee how the claim of the Petitioners to a stamp-free clearance can be\\naccepted even subject to this undertaking, which is difficult to\\nenforce. As against this, the Petitioners are sufficiently protected if\\nthey make payment and are deemed by an order of this Court to\\nhave made a payment on a without prejudice basis and under protest\\nand subject to the outcome of these Writ Petitions. That is surely\\nadequate protection for any assessee in any taxing statute. What is\\nbeing sought in the guise of a stamp duty-free delivery order is\\nliterally a free pass.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">9.     We note the statement of the learned Advocate General as\\nregards Bills of Entry. We are not inclined to continue the stay in\\nrespect of delivery orders. We clarify that any who wishes to clear\\ngoods through customs from any port or dock on or against a\\ndelivery order may do so on payment of the amount assessed to\\nstamp duty; but that payment, whether or not expressly stated, and\\nwhether or not that party is a Petitioner before us, will be treated as\\nor deemed to be a payment under protest, without prejudice and\\nsubject to the outcome of these Petitions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">10.    We have expanded this order somewhat to include others who\\nare not before us simply because what is being presented is a\\nquestion of interpretation of law and of certain provisions of the\\nstamp act. Individual case facts are not material.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">                             Page 28 of 30</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">                             1st March 2023\\n                                               910-912-OSWP3884-2021+.DOC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_15\\\">11.   We also do this because we now propose, after the\\namendment is effected and a short Reply to the extent necessary is\\nfiled, to take up the entire group for hearing and final disposal at the\\nearliest possible date.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_16\\\">12.   The Affidavits in Reply to the amended Petitions are to be\\nfiled and served by 25th March 2023. No further Affidavits are\\npermitted thereafter. The entire group is to be listed at 2:30 pm for\\nhearing and final disposal from 10th April 2023 onwards.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_17\\\">13.   Between them, for the final hearing, the Petitioners must\\narrange to have one of them as the lead Petitioner. We will not be\\nable to spend time hearing different counsel in each Petition repeat\\nthe same arguments, and we see no reason why lead counsel should\\nnot be able to argue all points covering all petitions. We will permit a\\njoint concise statement of written submissions or advance notes of\\nwritten submissions on behalf of all the Petitioners. It will therefore\\nnot be possible, having regard to the exigencies of time and the\\nnumber of matters listed, to hear all counsels for Petitioners\\nindividually. This may be an unfortunate and regrettable departure\\nfrom past practice, but the past is behind us and the future does not\\nlook very promising. All must work together to economise the time\\nof the Court.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_18\\\">14.   Lastly, and as a balance, if Dr Saraf is representing all the\\nRespondents, we do not see why he should have to face an entire\\narmy of Petitioners&#x27; counsel. The Petitioners would do well not to\\nattempt to turn this into a court room edition of the battle of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">                              Page 29 of 30</span>\\n                             1st March 2023\\n                                              910-912-OSWP3884-2021+.DOC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKurukshetra. Apart from anything else, we all know how that turned\\nout.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\">15.    Any previous ad-interim order extending the earlier stay to\\ndelivery orders stands modified in these terms.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\">16.
