In a sense, this judgment is not as\\nmuch about only the merits of the impugned conditions of the bail order, but is meant\\nto address a wider canvas of (what appears to be) entrenched paternalistic and\\nmisogynistic attitudes that are regrettably reflected at times in judicial orders and\\njudgments.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">3.

Further, the counsel urged that courses on gender\\nsensitization should be included in the curriculum of law schools, and the All-India\\nBar Exam should include questions on gender sensitization as well.

Women often experience obstacles in gaining access to mechanisms of redress,\\nincluding legal aid, counselling services and shelters. They are re-victimized and\\nexposed to further risk of violence through the denial of redress in the context of\\ninformal trials or negotiations between families and community leaders. The payment\\nof financial compensation by the perpetrator or his family for acts of violence against\\nwomen, in lieu of legal remedies, was a recurrent concern vis-à-vis the formal and\\ninformal justice systems. Violence against women in India is systematic and occurs in\\n\\n\\n20      A phrase that means the traits inherent to a thing or situation, especially a negative or difficult one   (See\\nhttps://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/the+nature+of+the+beast)\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_33\\\">\\f                                                       10</span>\\n\\n\\n\\nthe public and private spheres. It is underpinned by the persistence of patriarchal\\nsocial norms and inter- and intra-gender hierarchies.

Gender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence.\\nThe causes and factors of violence against women include entrenched unequal power\\nequations between men and women that foster violence and its acceptability,\\naggravated by cultural and social norms, economic dependence, poverty and alcohol\\nconsumption, etc. In India, the culprits are often known to the woman; the social and\\neconomic &quot;costs&quot; of reporting such crimes are high. General economic dependence on\\nfamily and fear of social ostracization act as significant disincentives for women to\\nreport any kind of sexual violence, abuse or abhorrent behaviour. Therefore, the actual\\nincidence of violence against women in India is probably much higher than the data\\nsuggests, and women may continue to face hostility and have to remain in\\nenvironments where they are subject to violence. This silence needs to be broken. In\\ndoing so, men, perhaps more than women have a duty and role to play in averting and\\ncombating violence against women.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_31\\\">22.     Unlike many other victims of interpersonal crimes such as theft, robbery or\\nmuggings, survivors of sexual assault are vulnerable to being blamed for their attack,\\nand thus victim-blaming (overtly or in more subtle forms) in sexual assault cases has\\nbeen the focus of several writings.

Sexual violence is varied in degree. At the highest (or, rather most aggravated)\\nlevel, is rape with or without attendant violence.

These outlaw behaviours such as stalking,\\neve-teasing, shades of verbal and physical assault, and harassment. Social attitudes\\ntypically characterize this latter category of crimes as “minor” offences. Such “minor”\\ncrimes are, regrettably not only trivialised or normalized, rather they are even\\nromanticized and therefore, invigorated in popular lore such as cinema.

The role of all courts is to make sure that the survivor can rely on their\\nimpartiality and neutrality, at every stage in a criminal proceeding, where she is the\\nsurvivor and an aggrieved party. Even an indirect undermining of this responsibility\\ncast upon the court, by permitting discursive formations on behalf of the accused, that\\nseek to diminish his agency, or underplay his role as an active participant (or\\nperpetrator) of the crime, could in many cases, shake the confidence of the rape\\nsurvivor (or accuser of the crime) in the impartiality of the court. The current attitude\\nregarding crimes against women typically is that “grave” offences like rape are not\\ntolerable and offenders must be punished. This, however, only takes into\\nconsideration rape and other serious forms of gender-based physical violence. The\\nchallenges Indian women face are formidable: they include a misogynistic society\\nwith entrenched cultural values and beliefs, bias (often sub-conscious) about the\\nstereotypical role of women, social and political structures that are heavily male-\\ncentric, most often legal enforcement structures that either cannot cope with, or are\\nunwilling to take strict and timely measures. Therefore, reinforcement of this\\nstereotype, in court utterances or orders, through considerations which are extraneous\\nto the case, would impact fairness.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_44\\\">32.   Academic writings highlight that a judgment at all levels has a number of\\ndistinct audiences, each of which engages with it in a different way. The parties to the\\ncase and their counsel will be interested in how the judge resolves their specific\\ndispute - what the law gives to or requires of them. At the same time, in a legal system\\nwhere judgments of courts set precedents, and in particular within a common law\\nsystem, judgments have significance beyond their authoritative resolution of a\\nspecific dispute—particularly in the Supreme Court. Thus, the judge is not only\\ncommunicating to the parties their rights and liabilities in the context of the specific\\ndispute being litigated; the judge is also addressing the broader legal community—\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_44\\\">\\f                                                      16</span>\\n\\n\\n\\nother lawyers, judges, legal academics, law students—and indeed the public at\\nlarge.29\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_45\\\">33.     Using rakhi tying as a condition for bail, transforms a molester into a\\nbrother, by a judicial mandate. This is wholly unacceptable, and has the effect of\\ndiluting and eroding the offence of sexual harassment. The act perpetrated on the\\nsurvivor constitutes an offence in law, and is not a minor transgression that can be\\nremedied by way of an apology, rendering community service, tying a rakhi or\\npresenting a gift to the survivor, or even promising to marry her, as the case may\\nbe. The law criminalizes outraging the modesty of a woman. Granting bail, subject\\nto such conditions, renders the court susceptible to the charge of re-negotiating and\\nmediating justice between confronting parties in a criminal offence and\\nperpetuating gender stereotypes.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_46\\\">34.     The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has noted that judicial\\nstereotyping “is a common and pernicious barrier to justice, particularly for women\\nvictims and survivors of violence.

Judges can play a significant role in ridding the justice system of harmful\\nstereotypes. They have an important responsibility to base their decisions on law and\\nfacts in evidence, and not engage in gender stereotyping. This requires judges to\\nidentify gender stereotyping, and identify how the application, enforcement or\\nperpetuation of these stereotypes discriminates against women or denies them equal\\naccess to justice. Stereotyping might compromise the impartiality of a judge’s\\ndecision and affect his or her views about witness credibility or the culpability of the\\naccused person.36As a judge of the Canadian Supreme Court remarked:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_29\\\">      “Myths and stereotypes are a form of bias because they impair the\\n      individual judge’s ability to assess the facts in a particular case in an\\n      open-minded fashion.
