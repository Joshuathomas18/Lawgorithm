Some of the High Courts\\nhave agreed with the said proposition.             However,\\naccording to the respective assessees and as per some of\\nthe High Courts’ decisions, if no assessment proceeding\\nis pending on the date of initiation of the search, the AO\\nmay consider only the incriminating material found during\\nthe search and is precluded from considering any other\\nmaterial derived from any other source.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">3.    Shri N. Venkataraman, learned Additional Solicitor\\nGeneral of India has appeared on behalf of the Revenue\\nand S/Shri Arvind P.

Venkataraman, learned ASG has made the\\nfollowing submissions on behalf of the Revenue:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">   i) It is submitted that under the Act, 1961, the charging\\n  section is <a href=\\\"/doc/339978/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">section 4</a>. It is submitted that thus the income\\n  tax is tax on ‘total income.’ It is submitted that the term\\n  ‘total income’ has been defined in <a href=\\\"/doc/1813579/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">section 2(45)</a> of the\\n  Act, 1961, which means the total amount of income\\n  referred to in <a href=\\\"/doc/65305/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">section 5</a> and computed in the manner\\n  laid down in the Act. It is submitted that as per <a href=\\\"/doc/36911/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">section\\n  5</a> of the Act, 1961, the ‘total income’ of any previous\\n  year of a person who is a resident includes all income\\n  from whatever source derived.        It is submitted that\\n  therefore the income tax is a tax on all income from\\n  whatever source derived in the case of a resident-\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">  assessee. Therefore, if any taxable income is left out,\\n  the resultant figure would be ‘partial income’ and not\\n  ‘total income’. It is submitted that any interpretation of\\n  any provision of the Act, 1961 which seeks to exclude\\n  any portion of the ‘total income’ from the ambit of\\n  taxation runs contrary to the scheme of taxation and\\n  hence is impermissible. It is submitted that thus the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_3\\\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

It is submitted that <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">section 139</a> of the Act,\\n  1961 requires an assessee to furnish his return of total\\n  income for the previous year. The return is processed\\n  under section 143(1). Sub-sections (2) and (3) contain\\n  provision for assessment of ‘total income’ by the AO. It\\n  is submitted that there is a possibility that income\\n  chargeable to tax has escaped assessment in the first\\n  instance. <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">Section 147</a> of the Act, 1961 enables the AO\\n  to assess or reassess the case and bring to tax such\\n  income also. Thus, the Act, 1961 contains elaborate\\n  machinery to facilitate determination of ‘total income’\\n  and collection of tax thereon.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">  iii) It is further submitted that the AO, in order to\\n  determine ‘total income’ correctly, needs to collect\\n  information from the assessee as well as third parties.\\n  The Statute contains many provisions enable the\\n  Department to collect information relating to the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_4\\\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

It is submitted that <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">section 132</a> of the Act,\\n  1961 is a tool for collecting information relating to tax\\n  evasion by an assessee. There are other provisions to\\n  ensure that the assessees are assessed correctly on\\n  their ‘total income’, namely, sections 142, 131, 133,\\n  133A and 285BA. It is submitted that apart from this,\\n  the Department keeps getting information relating to\\n  assessee from various sources, viz.:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">    (i) Suspicious Transaction Report from the Financial\\n    Intelligence Unit (FIU)\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_3\\\">    (ii) Information from other taxation authorities viz.

It is\\n  submitted that for the period prior to 30/06/1995,\\n  initially, there was no special provision for assessment\\n  of search cases.       Those assessments were made in\\n  accordance with the regular provisions relating to\\n  assessment of income, i.e., section 143(3) or <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">section\\n  147</a> of the Act, 1961.

It is for such reason that\\n  distinction made earlier qua undisclosed income vis-a-\\n  vis other income had been done away with under the\\n  regime of Section 153A and it is for that reason that the\\n  procedure for separate assessments qua undisclosed\\n  income and income other than undisclosed income has\\n  been    done   away    with.   The     omission   of   word\\n  “undisclosed income” in Section 153A does not mean\\n  that assessment consequent to search in the absence\\n  of any incriminating material being found during the\\n  course of search, the AO shall assume jurisdiction to\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_29\\\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

The provision of 153A still have to be read in\\n  light of Sections 132 and 132A.

The second proviso makes the intention\\n  of the Legislature clear as the same provides that\\n  assessment or reassessment, if any, relating to the six\\n  assessment years referred to in the sub-section pending on\\n  the date of initiation of search under section 132 or\\n  requisition under section 132A, as the case may be, shall\\n  abate.

The\\n  proviso thereto says, that such revival shall cease to have\\n  effect if such order of annulment is set aside. Thus, any\\n  proceeding of assessment or reassessment falling within the,\\n  six assessment years prior to the search or requisition stands\\n  abated and the total income of the assessee is required to be\\n  determined under <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_77\\\">section 153A</a>, of the Act. Similarly, sub-\\n  section (2) provides for revival of any assessment or\\n  reassessment which stood abated, if any proceeding or any\\n  order of assessment or reassessment made under <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_78\\\">section\\n  153A</a> of, the Act is annulled in appeal or any other\\n  proceeding.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_62\\\">  16.

When, the very purpose of the provision is to\\n  make assessment in case of search or requisition, it goes\\n  without saying that the assessment has to have relation to\\n  the search or requisition. In other words, the assessment,\\n  should be connected with something found during the search\\n  or requisition, viz., incriminating material which reveals\\n  undisclosed income Thus, while in view of the mandate of\\n  sub-section (1) of <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_79\\\">section 153A</a> of the Act, in every case\\n  where there is a search or requisition, the Assessing Officer\\n  is obliged to issue notice to such person to furnish returns of\\n  income for the six years preceding the assessment year\\n  relevant to the previous year in which the search is\\n  conducted or requisition is made, any addition or\\n  disallowance can be made only on the basis of material\\n  collected during the search or requisition. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"73963141\\\" id=\\\"span_62\\\">In case no\\n  incriminating material is found, as held by the Rajasthan High\\n  Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/73963141/\\\" id=\\\"a_80\\\">Jai Steel (India) v.

The erstwhile scheme of\\nblock assessment under Section 158BA envisaged\\nassessment of ‘undisclosed income’ for two reasons,\\nfirstly that there were two parallel assessments envisaged\\nunder the erstwhile regime, i.e., (i) block assessment\\nunder section 158BA to assess the ‘undisclosed income’\\nand (ii) regular assessment in accordance with the\\nprovisions of the Act to make assessment qua income\\nother than undisclosed income.         Secondly, that the\\n‘undisclosed income’ was chargeable to tax at a special\\nrate of 60% under section 113 whereas income other than\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_67\\\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

Therefore, section 153A came to be inserted and\\nbrought on the statute. Under Section 153A regime, the\\nintention of the legislation was to do away with the\\nscheme of two parallel assessments and tax the\\n‘undisclosed’ income too at the normal rate of tax as\\nagainst any special rate.         Thus, after introduction of\\nSection 153A and in case of search, there shall be block\\nassessment for six years.         Search assessments/block\\nassessments under Section 153A are triggered by\\nconducting of a valid search under <a href=\\\"/doc/262262/\\\" id=\\\"a_89\\\">Section 132</a> of the Act,\\n1961.     The   very    purpose    of   search,   which   is   a\\nprerequisite/trigger for invoking the provisions of sections\\n153A/153C is detection of undisclosed income by\\nundertaking extraordinary power of search and seizure,\\ni.e., the income which cannot be detected in ordinary\\ncourse of regular assessment. Thus, the foundation for\\nmaking search assessments under Sections 153A/153C\\ncan be said to be the existence of incriminating material\\nshowing undisclosed income detected as a result of\\nsearch.\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_55\\\">10.
