Background\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_2\\\">    1. The civil appeals arise out of a challenge to the Reserve Bank of India\\n\\n          (Frauds Classification and Reporting by Commercial Banks and Select FIs)\\n\\n          Directions 2016. 1 Issued by the Reserve Bank of India2, these directions\\n\\n          were challenged before different High Courts primarily on the ground that\\n\\n          no opportunity of being heard is envisaged to borrowers before classifying\\n\\n          their accounts as fraudulent. The High Court of Telangana has held in the\\n\\n          impugned judgment 3 that the principles of natural justice must be read into\\n\\n          the provisions of the Master Directions on Frauds. The decision has been\\n\\n          assailed by the RBI and lender banks through these civil appeals.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_3\\\">    2. In this background the court has to consider whether the principles of\\n\\n          natural justice should be read into the provisions of the Master Directions\\n\\n          on Frauds. For the reasons to follow, we hold that the principles of natural\\n\\n          justice, particularly the rule of audi alteram partem, has to be necessarily\\n\\n          read into the Master Directions on Frauds to save it from the vice of\\n\\n          arbitrariness. Since the classification of an account as fraud entails serious\\n\\n          civil consequences for the borrower, the directions must be construed\\n\\n          reasonably by reading into them the requirement of observing the\\n\\n          principles of natural justice.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\">\\n\\n\\n1 “Master Directions on Frauds”\\n2 “RBI”\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_13\\\">3 Writ Petition No. 19102 of 2019</span>\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_14\\\">                                            4</span>\\n\\fB.

B S Limited is a company engaged in the business of power transmission\\n\\n          and distribution, passive telecom infrastructure, renewable energy, and\\n\\n          mineral resources. It availed loans amounting to Rs. 1406 crores from\\n\\n          various banks. The company failed to meet its payment obligations to\\n\\n          lender banks, thereby defaulting in repayment of credit facilities. In\\n\\n          accordance with the Master Directions on Frauds, all the lender banks\\n\\n          formed a Joint Lenders Forum4 with State Bank of India as the lead bank.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">       4. The JLF declared the company’s assets as Non-Performing Assets 5 on 29\\n\\n          August 2016. The lender banks decided to adopt the Sustainable\\n\\n          Structuring of Stressed Assets Scheme 6 and suggested a forensic audit\\n\\n          report and Techno Economic Viability 7 study in its meeting held on 11 July\\n\\n          2016. Based on the conclusions of the forensic audit report, the JLF closed\\n\\n          the issue stating that there were no irregularities. However, based on the\\n\\n          TEV study it was concluded that the company was not eligible for the S4A\\n\\n          scheme and requested it to submit an alternative plan for regularization of\\n\\n          its account. In the meanwhile, IDBI Bank - one of the lender banks - red-\\n\\n          flagged the account of the company. Additionally, proceedings under the\\n4 “JLF”\\n5 “NPA”\\n6 “S4A Scheme”\\n7 “TEV”\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_15\\\">                                           5</span>\\n\\f          Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 were also initiated against the\\n\\n          company.

Subsequently, the Fraud Identification Committee 8 passed a\\n\\n          resolution on 31 July 2019 identifying the company’s account as fraud. The\\n\\n          company filed a writ petition challenging both the decision of the JLF dated\\n\\n          15 February 2019 and the resolution of the FIC dated 31 July 2019 before\\n\\n          the High Court of Telangana.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">       5.

The High Court further directed the lender banks: (i)\\n\\n          to give an opportunity of a hearing to the borrowers after furnishing a copy\\n\\n          of the forensic audit report; and (ii) to provide an opportunity of a personal\\n\\n          hearing to the borrower before classifying their account as fraud.

The appellant is a company involved in the manufacture of edible oils, fats,\\n\\n          rice and semolina products in the State of Telangana. From 2003 to 2015,\\n\\n          the appellant availed of credit facilities to the tune of Rs. 675 crores from a\\n\\n          consortium of banks led by the Andhra Bank (now merged with the Union\\n\\n          Bank of India). The appellant was declared as an NPA on 14 May 2018\\n\\n          with effect from 31 March 2018. Thereafter, the consortium of lenders in a\\n\\n          meeting of the JLF decided to conduct a forensic audit of the appellant for\\n\\n          the period till 31 March 2019. The appellant participated in the audit\\n\\n          process and submitted all the information required by the auditor from time\\n\\n          to time. In September 2019, the appellant learnt that its account has been\\n\\n          declared as fraud by the Union Bank of India (erstwhile Andhra Bank).\\n\\n          Aggrieved by that classification, the appellant filed a writ petition before the\\n\\n          High Court of Telangana. The High Court declined to deal with the issues\\n\\n          pertaining to the principles of natural justice and fair play considering the\\n\\n          fact that they were pending before this Court in SLP (C) No. 3931 of 2021.\\n\\n          By its judgment dated 22 December 2021, the High court dismissed the\\n\\n          writ petitions. The court held that the appellant’s account was rightly\\n\\n          classified as fraud because the forensic audit report contained adverse\\n\\n          findings against the appellant.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">    7.

The appellant is a promoter and director of Golden Jubilee Hotels Pvt\\n\\n         Ltd. 10 GJHPL availed financial assistance from the respondent banks for\\n\\n         the construction and development of a hotel in Hyderabad. GJHPL’s\\n\\n         account was declared as NPA from 31 December 2015 because of its\\n\\n         inability to service its debts to the respondent banks. At its meeting on 21\\n\\n         April 2016, the JLF decided to carry out a special audit of the appellant’s\\n\\n         company. Thereafter, the appellant participated in a series of meetings\\n\\n         between the JLF and was consulted by the forensic auditor during the\\n\\n         preparation of the audit report. Bank of Baroda red-flagged the appellant’s\\n\\n         account on 03 May 2019 based on the observations in the forensic audit\\n\\n         report. The appellant’s account was classified as fraud on 14 August 2019.\\n\\n         A criminal complaint was also lodged with the CBI. The appellant came to\\n\\n         know about the classification of their account as fraud in 2021, when they\\n\\n         received a copy of the FIR. The appellant filed a writ petition before the\\n\\n         High Court of Telangana challenging the validity of the Master Directions\\n\\n         on Frauds. The High Court by its judgment dated 31 December 2021 held\\n\\n         that no relief could be granted to the appellant on the issue of personal\\n\\n         hearing since SLP (C) No. 3931 of 2021 was pending before this Court.\\n\\n         The High Court also held that the appellant’s account was rightly classified\\n\\n         as fraudulent in view of the adverse findings in the forensic audit report.\\n10 “GJHPL”\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_19\\\">                                            8</span>\\n\\fIV.

The appellant is one of the directors of a company called M/s Vimal Oil &amp;\\n\\n         Foods Limited. The said company availed of loan facilities from various\\n\\n         financial institutions over a period of time. In 2015, the auditor of the\\n\\n         respondent bank flagged certain irregularities in the accounts of the\\n\\n         company. Based on a special audit, the respondent bank declared the\\n\\n         account of the company as NPA on 30 September 2015. Thereafter, on 05\\n\\n         July 2016, the company’s account was red-flagged by the respondent\\n\\n         bank. In the meantime, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process 11\\n\\n         was initiated against the company on 19 December 2017 and the appellant\\n\\n         was suspended as Managing Director of the company. Upon suspension,\\n\\n         the appellant was not invited to attend the meetings of the JLF. The\\n\\n         appellant allegedly learnt that the respondent bank had classified their\\n\\n         account as fraud on 21 February 2018 though without any intimation.\\n\\n         Further, based on a letter addressed by the respondent bank to the CBI,\\n\\n         an FIR came to be registered against the appellant. The appellant alleges\\n\\n         that they acquired knowledge about their account being classified as fraud\\n\\n         and registration of the FIR only when a search was carried out at their\\n\\n         residential premises in pursuance of the FIR. The appellant filed a Special\\n\\n         Civil Application challenging the actions of the respondent bank, which was\\n\\n         dismissed by the Single Judge of the High Court of Gujarat. The Division\\n\\n         Bench partly allowed a Letters Patent Appeal by its judgment dated 23\\n\\n         December 2021 by permitting the appellant to address a representation to\\n\\n11 “CIRP”\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_20\\\">                                          9</span>\\n\\f     the respondent bank but declined to allow a personal hearing.

Once a bank account is\\n\\n              classified as fraudulent, it carries significant consequences\\n\\n              according to the Master Directions on Frauds such as filing of a\\n\\n              complaint with the CBI and debarment of the promoters and\\n\\n              directors from accessing institutional finance.

Two fundamental principles of natural justice are entrenched in\\n\\n   Indian jurisprudence: (i) nemo judex in causa sua, which means that no\\n\\n   person should be a judge in their own cause; and (ii) audi alteram partem,\\n\\n   which means that a person affected by administrative, judicial or quasi-\\n\\n   judicial action must be heard before a decision is taken. The courts\\n\\n   generally favor interpretation of a statutory provision consistent with the\\n\\n   principles of natural justice because it is presumed that the statutory\\n\\n   authorities do not intend to contravene fundamental rights.

Concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of\\n                 change in recent years. Rules of natural justice are not rules\\n                 embodied always expressly in a statute or in rules framed\\n                 thereunder. They may be implied from the nature of the duty to be\\n                 performed under a statute. What particular rule of natural justice\\n                 should be implied and what its context should be in a given case\\n                 must depend to a great extent on the fact and circumstances of\\n                 that case, the framework of the statute under which the enquiry is\\n                 held. The old distinction between a judicial act and an\\n                 administrative act has withered away. Even an administrative\\n                 order which involves civil consequences must be consistent\\n                 with the rules of natural justice. The expression “civil\\n                 consequences” encompasses infraction of not merely\\n                 property or personal rights but of civil liberties, material\\n                 deprivations and non-pecuniary damages. In its wide umbrella\\n                 comes everything that affects a citizen in his civil life.\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_58\\\">                                                               (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n       There is a consistent pattern of judicial thought that civil consequences\\n\\n       entail infractions not merely of property or personal rights, but also of civil\\n\\n       liberties, material deprivations, and non-pecuniary damages. Every order\\n\\n       or proceeding which involves civil consequences or adversely affects a\\n\\n       citizen should be in accordance with the principles of natural justice.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_59\\\">   37.

Under the said clause, the borrower, including the promoters\\n\\n  and directors of the company, are barred from availing credit from financial\\n\\n  markets and credit markets for a period of five years, and possibly even\\n\\n  beyond.

The question in <a href=\\\"/doc/146707759/\\\" id=\\\"a_37\\\">Jah Developers</a> (supra) was whether a person who is\\n\\n  declared to be a wilful defaulter according to the procedure <a href=\\\"/doc/146707759/\\\" id=\\\"a_38\\\">laid down in</a>\\n\\n  the Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters is entitled to be represented by a\\n\\n  lawyer of their choice before such a declaration is made. The Court held\\n\\n  that a borrower does not have the right to be represented by a lawyer in\\n\\n  the course of in-house proceedings envisaged in Paragraph 3 of the\\n\\n  Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters. Paragraph 3 of the Master Circular on\\n\\n  Wilful Defaulters provides a two-tier process for identification of a wilful\\n\\n  defaulter. At the first stage, a First Committee headed by an Executive\\n\\n  Director or equivalent and consisting of two other senior officers of the\\n\\n  bank must, after examining the evidence of wilful default and concluding\\n\\n  that wilful default has occurred, issue a show-cause notice to the\\n\\n  concerned borrowers and promoters/ whole-time directors calling for their\\n\\n  submissions. The First Committee has to consider the submissions before\\n\\n  recording the fact of wilful default with reasons. If the Committee deems it\\n\\n  necessary, it could also provide a personal hearing to the borrower and the\\n\\n  promoter/ whole-time director of the borrowing company. The second\\n\\n  stage is that the order of the First Committee is reviewed by another\\n\\n  Committee, known as the Review Committee. Thus, it is clear that the\\n\\n  procedure for declaration of a borrower as a wilful defaulter is different\\n\\n  from the procedure envisaged under the Master Directions on Frauds for\\n\\n  classifying a borrower’s account as fraud. However, by virtue of Clause\\n\\n  8.12.1 of the Master Directions on Frauds, the penal provisions applicable\\n\\n  to wilful defaulters also apply to fraudulent borrowers. Thus, although the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_61\\\">                                   32</span>\\n\\fprocedure adopted for declaration of a wilful defaulter is different from that\\n\\nenvisaged for classifying the borrower’s account as fraud, they will face\\n\\nsimilar consequences. In fact, as mentioned above, the borrowers’\\n\\naccounts classified as fraud under the Master Directions on Frauds will\\n\\nface certain additional consequences which have been <a href=\\\"/doc/146707759/\\\" id=\\\"a_39\\\">laid down in</a>\\n\\nClauses 8.12.2 and 8.12.3.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"146707759\\\" id=\\\"span_62\\\">Since the consequences flowing from the two\\n\\ncirculars are similar, the observations in <a href=\\\"/doc/146707759/\\\" id=\\\"a_40\\\">Jah Developers</a> (supra) on the\\n\\neffect of declaring a borrower as wilful defaulter will be squarely applicable\\n\\nto the present case.

However, we are of the view that <a href=\\\"/doc/935769/\\\" id=\\\"a_41\\\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> is\\n         attracted in the facts of the present case as the moment a\\n         person is declared to be a wilful defaulter, the impact on its\\n         fundamental right to carry on business is direct and\\n         immediate. This is for the reason that no additional facilities\\n         can be granted by any bank/financial institutions, and\\n         entrepreneurs/promoters would be barred from institutional\\n         finance for five years. Banks/financial institutions can even\\n         change the management of the wilful defaulter, and a\\n         promoter/director of a wilful defaulter cannot be made\\n         promoter or director of any other borrower company.

Classification of the borrower’s account as fraud under the Master\\n\\n        Directions on Frauds virtually leads to a credit freeze for the borrower, who\\n\\n        is debarred from raising finance from financial markets and capital\\n\\n        markets. The bar from raising finances could be fatal for the borrower\\n\\n        leading to its ‘civil death’ in addition to the infraction of their rights under\\n\\n        <a href=\\\"/doc/935769/\\\" id=\\\"a_44\\\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution. Since debarring disentitles a person or\\n\\n        entity from exercising their rights and/or privileges, it is elementary that the\\n\\n        principles of natural justice should be made applicable and the person\\n\\n        against whom an action of debarment is sought should be given an\\n\\n        opportunity of being heard. Indeed, debarment is akin to blacklisting a\\n\\n        borrower from availing credit. Black’s Law Dictionary 30 explains the term\\n\\n        ‘blacklist’ has been defined in the following terms:\\n\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_63\\\">                   “A list of persons marked out for special avoidance, antagonism, or\\n                   enmity on the part of those who prepare the list or those among\\n                   whom it is intended to circulate; as where a trades-union\\n                   “blacklists” workmen who refuse to conform to its rules, or where a\\n                   list of insolvent or untrustworthy persons is published by a\\n                   commercial agency or mercantile association.”\\n\\n                                                                 (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n        Similarly, P Ramanatha Aiyar’s Law Lexicon 31 defines the term “blacklist”\\n\\n        as follows:\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_64\\\">                   “Black List is a list of persons or firms against whom its compiler\\n                   would warn the public, or some section of the public; a list of\\n                   persons unworthy of credit, or with whom it is not advisable\\n\\n30 Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th edn (1979)\\n31 P Ramanatha Aiyar, ‘The Law Lexicon: The Encyclopedic Law Dictionary’ (1997 edn)\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_65\\\">                                               34</span>\\n\\f                     to make contracts.

Conversely, if the statute conferring the\\n                     power is silent with regard to the giving of a pre-decisional\\n                     hearing to the person affected and the administrative decision\\n                     taken by the authority involves civil consequences of a grave\\n                     nature, and no full review or appeal on merits against that\\n                     decision is provided, courts will be extremely reluctant to\\n                     construe such a statute as excluding the duty of affording\\n                     even a minimal hearing shorn of all its formal trappings and\\n                     dilatory features at the pre-decisional stage, unless, viewed\\n                     pragmatically, it would paralyse the administrative progress or\\n                     frustrate the need for utmost promptitude.

The rule of natural justice with which we are concerned in\\n            these appeals and writ petitions, namely, the audi alteram\\n            partem rule, in its fullest amplitude means that a person\\n            against whom an order to his prejudice may be passed should\\n            be informed of the allegations and charges against him, be\\n            given an opportunity of submitting his explanation thereto,\\n            have the right to know the evidence, both oral or\\n            documentary, by which the matter is proposed to be decided\\n            against him, and to inspect the documents which are relied\\n            upon for the purpose of being used against him, to have the\\n            witnesses who are to give evidence against him examined in\\n            his presence and have the right to cross-examine them, and\\n            to lead his own evidence, both oral and documentary, in his\\n            defence. The process of a fair hearing need not, however,\\n            conform to the judicial process in a Court of law, because judicial\\n            adjudication of causes involves a number of technical rules of\\n            procedure and evidence which are unnecessary and not required\\n            for the purpose of a fair hearing within the meaning of audi alteram\\n            partem rule in a quasi-judicial or administrative inquiry.

Before concluding, we also want to address the argument by the borrowers\\n\\n       that the requirement of passing a reasoned order must be read into the\\n\\n       Master Directions on Frauds. The borrowers also relied on <a href=\\\"/doc/146707759/\\\" id=\\\"a_108\\\">Jah\\n\\n       Developers</a> (supra) where it was held that a final decision of the Review\\n\\n       Committee declaring the borrower as a ‘wilful defaulter’ must be made by a\\n\\n       reasoned order.

In light of the legal position noted above, we hold that the rule of audi\\n\\n       alteram partem ought to be read in Clauses 8.9.4 and 8.9.5 of the Master\\n\\n       Directions on Fraud.

A\\n\\n       reasoned order has to be issued on the objections addressed by the\\n\\n       borrower.

In pursuance of our\\n\\n   aforesaid reasoning, we hold that the decision by the lender banks to\\n\\n   classify the borrower accounts as fraud, is violative of the principles of\\n\\n   natural justice.

Lastly, the borrowers have argued that the Master Directions on Frauds\\n\\n   suffer from manifest arbitrariness because they stipulate an opportunity of\\n\\n   a hearing to third parties, while denying the same to borrowers, who face\\n\\n   significant civil consequences. Clause 8.12.5 of the Master Directions on\\n\\n   Frauds provides that banks have to satisfy themselves of the involvement\\n\\n   of third parties and provide them with an opportunity of being heard before\\n\\n   reporting them to Indian Banks’ Association. We are unable to accept this\\n\\n   argument of the borrowers in light of the fact that the borrowers and the\\n\\n   third parties stand on a different footing because: (i) the borrowers are the\\n\\n   main perpetrators of fraud, while the third parties are merely facilitators;\\n\\n   and (ii) it is the borrowers who face the significant civil consequences\\n\\n   stipulated under clauses 8.12.1 and 8.12.2, while the third party service\\n\\n   providers are merely referred to the Indian Banks’ Association which\\n\\n   maintains a caution list of such service providers. However, this view does\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_125\\\">                                    56</span>\\n\\f     not affect our conclusions in view of the discussion in the preceding\\n\\n     paragraphs.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_140\\\">\\nE. Conclusion\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_141\\\">  81. The conclusions are summarized below:\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_142\\\">\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_92\\\">         i. No opportunity of being heard is required before an FIR is lodged\\n\\n            and registered;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_93\\\">          ii. Classification of an account as fraud not only results in reporting\\n\\n             the crime to investigating agencies, but also has other penal and\\n\\n             civil consequences against the borrowers;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_94\\\">         iii. Debarring the borrowers from accessing institutional finance under\\n\\n            Clause 8.12.1 of the Master Directions on Frauds results in\\n\\n            serious civil consequences for the borrower;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_95\\\">         iv. Such a debarment under Clause 8.12.1 of the Master Directions\\n\\n            on Frauds is akin to blacklisting the borrowers for being\\n\\n            untrustworthy and unworthy of credit by banks. This Court has\\n\\n            consistently held that an opportunity of hearing ought to be\\n\\n            provided before a person is blacklisted;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_96\\\">         v. The application of audi alteram partem cannot be impliedly\\n\\n            excluded under the Master Directions on Frauds. In view of the\\n\\n            time frame contemplated under the Master Directions on Frauds\\n\\n            as well as the nature of the procedure adopted, it is reasonably\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_126\\\">                                     57</span>\\n\\f           practicable for the lender banks to provide an opportunity of a\\n\\n           hearing to the borrowers before classifying their account as fraud;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_97\\\">        vi. The principles of natural justice demand that the borrowers must\\n\\n           be served a notice, given an opportunity to explain the conclusions\\n\\n           of the forensic audit report, and be allowed to represent by the\\n\\n           banks/ JLF before their account is classified as fraud under the\\n\\n           Master Directions on Frauds. In addition, the decision classifying\\n\\n           the borrower’s account as fraudulent must be made by a reasoned\\n\\n           order; and\\n\\n\\n        vii. Since the Master Directions on Frauds do not expressly provide an\\n\\n           opportunity of hearing to the borrowers before classifying their\\n\\n           account as fraud, audi alteram partem has to be read into the\\n\\n           provisions of the directions to save them from the vice of\\n\\n           arbitrariness.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_143\\\">82. In the result, the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of\\n\\n   Telangana dated 10 December 2020 is upheld. The judgments of the High\\n\\n   Court of Telangana dated 22 December 2021 and 31 December 2021, and\\n\\n   of the High Court of Gujarat dated 23 December 2021 are accordingly set\\n\\n   aside.
