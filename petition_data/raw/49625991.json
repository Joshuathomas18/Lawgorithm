It is the interpretation of these “contingencies” that\\n\\nrequires further consideration. The “contingencies” ought to be\\n\\ninterpreted in a manner which saves the past transactions to the extent\\n\\nthey can be saved as it is clearly not the intention of the Act of 2013 to\\n\\ntide over all past transactions.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_21\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_22\\\">13.

Therefore, if only a minority of the claimants are disbursed with\\n\\nthe compensation, such claimants would get benefit of compensation\\n\\nunder the Act of 2013 to a limited extent without lapsing. Thus, it is\\n\\nclear that even if the acquisition does not lapse, all the beneficiaries to\\n\\nwhom the compensation is payable would be entitled to compensation\\n\\nunder the Act of 2013.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_25\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_26\\\">15.

It is contended that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_81\\\">Section 24(2)</a> is, therefore, controlled by\\n\\nthe proviso mandating again a further middle path consciously chosen\\n\\nby Parliament.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_28\\\">16.   It is argued that while providing for a transitory provision or\\n\\nsituations resulting into “lapsing” of all the steps already taken under\\n\\nthe Act under repeal, the legislature always envisages several\\n\\ncontingencies which emerge out of its day-to-day experience.           The\\n\\nmanner in which <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_82\\\">section 24</a>[2] and the proviso attached therewith are\\n\\ndrafted clearly discloses that Parliament intended certain inevitable\\n\\ncontingencies which frequently arose in land acquisition proceedings.\\n\\nIt was urged illustratively, that often, land acquired belongs to benami\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_21\\\">\\f                                     11</span>\\n\\nowners, who cannot put forward title, or claim compensation or identify\\n\\nthemselves. In such situations, it may not be possible for an acquiring\\n\\nauthority to “pay” [which, as plain language indicates, would mean\\n\\nsetting apart for being taken by the entitled persons as explained\\n\\nhereafter] to “all” land holders/ entitled persons. However, as is clear\\n\\nfrom the proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_83\\\">Section 24</a>[2], if it can be shown that the amount is\\n\\ndeposited for majority of share-holding, the acquisition would be saved\\n\\nand cannot lapse; the only consequence would be the determination of\\n\\nbenefits under the Act of 2013. Parliamentary intent in the proviso\\n\\nclearly appears to be to ascertain the stage up to which the land\\n\\nacquisition proceedings under <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_84\\\">LA Act</a> have reached. If nobody is paid\\n\\nthe compensation or compensation is not taken by everyone though\\n\\ntendered and/or kept ready, the legislature contemplates such a\\n\\nsituation to be a reversible one and, therefore, provides for lapsing of all\\n\\nprevious stages prior to “non-payment”. However, if it can be\\n\\ndemonstrated that though - (1) compensation was tendered to all; (2)\\n\\nsome of them [for whatever reason] did not take the compensation; and\\n\\n(3) compensation is deposited in case of majority of the land holdings\\n\\n[viz. setting apart the share of such persons and making it available for\\n\\nthem to take it], then, neither proceedings would lapse nor the\\n\\ncompensation will be required to be determined under the Act of 2013.\\n\\nIn substance, therefore, the legal situation would be akin to the one\\n\\ncontemplated under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_85\\\">Section 24</a>[1][b] for all practical purposes.\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_22\\\">\\f                                    12</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_29\\\">17.   It is submitted that during the drafting of the Bill, the legislative\\n\\nintent and the apprehensions of the stakeholders in the acquisition\\n\\nprocess is clearly depicted in 31st Report of the ‘Standing Committee on\\n\\nRural Development’ while discussing the ‘The Land Acquisition,\\n\\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2011’ which was the precursor to\\n\\nthe Act of 2013. The learned SG relied on extracts of the Standing\\n\\nCommittee Reports, the draft Bill, various comments from government\\n\\nand public agencies and departments and other stakeholders, the\\n\\nstage(s) during which amendments were proposed to the draft\\n\\nprovisions (of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_86\\\">Section 24</a>) and its culmination into the present form and\\n\\nstructure.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_30\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_31\\\">18.   The learned SG argued that the amendments proposed by the\\n\\nMinister while introducing the Bill - to incorporate an explanation, as\\n\\nto what constitutes “deposit” was not accepted in the legislative wisdom\\n\\nof the Lok Sabha and the Bill so passed consciously did not incorporate\\n\\nthe Explanation (in the form of Proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_87\\\">Section 24(2)</a>) providing for an\\n\\nextensive and artificial meaning of the word paid. Further, reference to\\n\\n“bank” account was also consciously not incorporated thereby leaving\\n\\nthe expression “to pay” and &quot;to deposit&quot; with its natural meaning and\\n\\nleaving it to the discretion of the acquiring authorities to deposit the\\n\\ncompensation amount even in the treasury.         It is possible that the\\n\\nlegislature may have considered the reality of 2012-13 where crores of\\n\\npeople did not have bank accounts. It was also urged that the rejection\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_23\\\">\\f                                     13</span>\\n\\nof the amendment is in consonance with the apprehensions expressed\\n\\nby other stakeholders and ministries at the said time. After the said Bill\\n\\nwas passed in the Lok Sabha, amendments were proposed and accepted\\n\\nby the Rajya Sabha, giving the provision its final form. Further, it is\\n\\nclear that the effort at the time was towards the drafting of a balancing\\n\\nprovision which protects the acquisitions from lapsing and at the same\\n\\ntime provides enhanced compensation under the new Act depending\\n\\nupon the stage up to which the acquisition has progressed. This was\\n\\nthe genesis behind <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_88\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> and proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_89\\\">Section 24(2)</a> which\\n\\nprotect    acquisitions   from   lapsing   whilst     providing   for   higher\\n\\ncompensation under the Act of 2013 to the land owners under limited\\n\\ndefined circumstances. It is submitted that it is necessary to read the\\n\\nproviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_90\\\">Section 24(2)</a> along with the same provision and not <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_91\\\">Section\\n\\n24(1)(b)</a> as the former would be in accord with Parliamentary intent.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_32\\\">19.

It is submitted that the\\n\\nfield of retrospectivity to be given under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_94\\\">Section 24</a> needs to be\\n\\nconsidered in the context of legislative intention manifested from\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_95\\\">Section 114</a> of the Act of 2013 and <a href=\\\"/doc/1030013/\\\" id=\\\"a_96\\\">Section 6</a> of the General Clauses Act,\\n\\n1897.

Learned counsel next submitted that the expression “paid” should\\n\\nbe construed reasonably and not in a literal manner, as was done in\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/185065833/\\\" id=\\\"a_122\\\">Pune Municipal Corporation</a> (supra). <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_123\\\">Before the Act</a> of 2013 was brought\\n\\ninto force, the modes of payment recognized by the law were: tendering\\n\\npayment, payment into court in the event no one entitled to alienate the\\n\\nproperty received it and payment into court upon disputes about the\\n\\nentitlement to receive payment. These three situations were visualized\\n\\nin <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_124\\\">Section 31 (2)</a> of the old Act. It was emphasized that the consequence\\n\\nof lapse of acquisition was never contemplated, in the event of refusal\\n\\nto accept payment, or absence of anyone entitled to receive it, or in the\\n\\ncontingency of a dispute regarding entitlement to receive the amount.\\n\\nThis clearly meant that while payment of compensation was essential\\n\\nand mandatory, the mode of payment was not mandatory. If, for\\n\\ninstance, the amount was tendered and not received, but instead, the\\n\\nlandowner refused it, the appropriate government could well deposit it\\n\\nin the treasury, in accordance with prevailing financial rules, to\\n\\nfacilitate disbursement, as and when the landowner or the one entitled\\n\\nto receive it, came forward and established entitlement. In such event,\\n\\nthe only consequence of non-deposit (in court, under <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_125\\\">Section 31</a>) meant\\n\\nthat higher interest as mandated by <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_126\\\">Section 34</a> was to be paid.</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_59\\\">\\f                                   19</span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_41\\\">26.   The context of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_127\\\">Section 24</a>, learned counsel urged, is to provide for\\n\\na transitory provision viz. to take care of the pending land acquisition\\n\\nproceedings which are ongoing under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_128\\\">LA Act</a> when the Act of 2013\\n\\nis brought into force w.e.f. 1.1.2014. The purpose and object of making\\n\\nthis provision is to balance the competing rights of public projects vis-\\n\\nà-vis holders of the land. The object and purpose was to ensure that\\n\\nwhere acquisition proceedings under <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_129\\\">LA Act</a> have reached an advanced\\n\\nstage and investment of public money had already been made, firstly,\\n\\nthe lapsing of such ongoing projects should be avoided and secondly as\\n\\nfar as possible, the land owners also can, without disturbing the process\\n\\nof acquisition, be given the compensation under the Act of 2013.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_42\\\">27.   It was reiterated that the legislature knows about the ground\\n\\nrealities faced in land acquisition proceedings. There are very few cases\\n\\nwhere one or two land parcels are acquired in isolation.         Mostly,\\n\\nacquisitions take place of bigger tracts of land involving more than one\\n\\nparcel of land and more than one person “entitled to compensation”.\\n\\nWhen Parliament provided for a transitory provision in relation to\\n\\nacquisitions under the old Act, it did not contemplate the possibility of\\n\\nthe entire payment procedure to all being not processed given the\\n\\npractical situations arising in all such proceedings. Parliament is also\\n\\npresumed to be aware of the fact that in almost all cases of acquisition,\\n\\nthe proceedings are stiffly opposed and in most of the cases, the tender\\n\\nof compensation is also opposed under a wrong and misplaced notion\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_60\\\">\\f                                    20</span>\\n\\nthat the acceptance of the tender may be treated as acquiescence with\\n\\nthe quantum being tendered.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_43\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_44\\\">28.   The learned counsel argued that Parliament did not expect the\\n\\nacquiring authority to perform an impossible task of forcing payment to\\n\\nthe land owners unwilling, for any reason to accept it. The legislature,\\n\\ntherefore, does not use the expression of the land owners having\\n\\n“accepted” the payment. It merely uses the expression “paid”.          The\\n\\nlegislature clearly tries to balance the rights of land owners only in one\\n\\ncontingency viz. in a post award scenario and the award having been\\n\\nmade five years prior to 1.1.2014, when the amount is not “deposited”\\n\\nin the accounts of the majority of the beneficiaries.\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_45\\\">29.   It was urged that on a true construction and taking the literal,\\n\\nnatural and grammatical meaning of the provisions in the context\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/185065833/\\\" id=\\\"a_130\\\">referred above</a> and keeping in mind the object it can safely be concluded\\n\\nthat the words “paid” and “deposit” are expressions of the same act\\n\\nnamely making the amount available (i.e. tendering) for being taken by\\n\\nthose entitled to it. It was urged that if this interpretation is not given\\n\\nthen the refusal by few persons or few persons being untraceable in the\\n\\nacquisition of a vast tract of land would result in the drastic\\n\\nconsequence of lapsing of the acquisition proceedings.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_46\\\">30.   It was urged by the learned ASG and Mr. Muthuraj, learned senior\\n\\ncounsel that the legislature cannot be presumed to intend such an\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_61\\\">\\f                                    21</span>\\n\\nanomalous situation. The only way in which the object behind <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_131\\\">section\\n\\n24</a> can be achieved is to give natural meaning to the words and\\n\\nexpressions used keeping the object in mind and treating the words\\n\\n“paid” and “deposit” as connoting expression of the very same Act\\n\\ndepending upon the fact situation in each case. Learned counsel\\n\\nsubmitted that by using the terms “paid” and “deposit”, Parliament\\n\\nconsciously left a leeway to save the drastic consequence of lapsing by\\n\\ndealing with a particular situation in light of fact situation emerging in\\n\\neach case. Not treating “paid” and “deposit” as synonymous or the\\n\\n“deposit” so as to keep it available being the next step after “pay”, would\\n\\nlead to disastrous situations as the acquiring authority may have\\n\\nacquired vast tract of land and may have put substantial portion from\\n\\nit to public use by constructing infrastructural projects.        Such a\\n\\ndisastrous situation /consequence would never have been anticipated\\n\\nor envisaged by the legislature. Learned counsel also referred to various\\n\\nStanding Orders, framed as part of the financial code of several States,\\n\\nwhich provided for procedure to deposit money in the treasury, when\\n\\nlandowners refused to accept compensation, or were untraceable, at the\\n\\ntime the amount was to be tendered.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_47\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_48\\\">31.   It is submitted by the learned ASG that this Court should not\\n\\nassume any omission or add or amend words to the statute. It is\\n\\nsubmitted that plain and unambiguous construction has to be given\\n\\nwithout addition and substitution of the words. It is submitted that\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_62\\\">\\f                                               22</span>\\n\\nwhen a literal reading produces an intelligible result it is not open to\\n\\nread words or add words to statute. In support of this proposition,\\n\\nreliance was placed on some decisions23. It was therefore submitted\\n\\nthat the word “paid” does not and cannot mean actual de-facto payment\\n\\nas it would amount to adding words which do not exist in the provision.\\n\\nSimilarly, the word “deposit” cannot mean “deposit in the Court” as that\\n\\nwas never the legislative intent nor can it be deduced from any accepted\\n\\ninterpretive process.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_49\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_50\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"185065833\\\" id=\\\"span_63\\\">32.

It is apparent from aforesaid that &quot;tender” may save the tendering\\n\\nparty from the penalty for non-payment or non-performance if another\\n\\nparty is unjustifiably refusing the tender. The expression “paid&quot; would\\n\\nmean in <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_165\\\">Section 31(1)</a> of the LA Act and <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_166\\\">Section 24(2)</a> of the Act of 2013\\n\\nas soon as it is offered and made unconditionally available. Merely, if a\\n\\nlandowner refuses to accept it, it cannot be said that it has not been\\n\\npaid.

If the intention of Parliament\\n\\nwas to divest the State of its title that had to be stated in plain and clear\\n\\nlanguage. It was emphasized that the conjunctive use of “or” in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_228\\\">Section\\n\\n24 (2)</a> would have not only momentous consequences to the State, but\\n\\ninnocent third parties, who would be exposed to the risk of being\\n\\ndivested title to the lands and properties, perfected by them, as allottees\\n\\nor subsequent purchasers. Merely because a person who has received\\n\\ncompensation clungs on to the possession of the land and the same\\n\\nshall lead to lapsing cannot be the intention of Parliament. Similarly,\\n\\none who received compensation, is not obliged to return the money to\\n\\nthe State in the event of lapsing under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_229\\\">Section 24(2)</a> of the Act of 2013.\\n\\nIt was urged, therefore, that absence of provision to return the\\n\\ncompensation        received     to   Government         convincingly      points     to\\n\\nParliamentary intent that &quot;or&quot; should be read as &quot;and&quot;; thus, only if\\n\\nneither possession is taken (of acquired lands) nor is compensation\\n\\npaid, (i.e., tendered to the party or parties) would the acquisition under\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_230\\\">LA Act</a> lapse.

Learned counsel submitted that a deeming fiction\\n\\ncannot be taken to this extent; such disastrous consequences could not\\n\\nhave been attributed by Parliament, because even if such were the\\n\\nintent, there has to be a mechanism to restitute those likely to be\\n\\naffected. Besides, the legality of such a law, divesting or taking away the\\n\\ntitle of such innocent third-party purchasers, would be suspect,\\n\\nbecause there is absolutely no provision for restitution or any form of\\n\\ncompensation in their favour.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_82\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_83\\\">50.   On the question relating to the mode of taking possession, it was\\n\\nargued that when the State is involved in taking possession of the\\n\\nproperty acquired, it can take possession by drawing a panchnama. The\\n\\nnormal rule of State possessing the land through some persons would\\n\\nnot be applicable in such cases. On open land, possession is deemed to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLieutenant Governor, Government of NCT, Delhi and Ors., (2009) 10 SCC 501 and\\nChandragauda Ramgonda Patil and Anr. v.

The way the State takes possession of large chunk of\\n\\nproperty acquired is by drawing a memorandum of taking possession\\n\\nas State is not going to put other persons in possession or its police\\n\\nforce or going to cultivate it or start residing or physically occupy it after\\n\\ndisplacing who were physically in possession as in the case of certain\\n\\nprivate persons, in case they re-enter in possession of open land, start\\n\\ncultivation or residing in the house. Lawful possession is deemed to be\\n\\nof the State. A number of decisions that accepted the mode of drawing\\n\\npanchnama by the State consistently to be a mode of taking possession\\n\\nwere cited. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"195483504\\\" id=\\\"span_102\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/195483504/\\\" id=\\\"a_232\\\">Banda Development Authority v.

In view of the maxim actus curae neminem gravabit or even\\n\\nin its absence, any interim order granted by the court cannot prejudice\\n\\nany rights of the parties. It is argued that for a proper working of the\\n\\njustice delivery system, once the court passes an order staying\\n\\ndispossession, the State cannot take possession of the land. If an order\\n\\nof the Court disables a person to take any action, the doctrine nemo\\n\\ntentur ad impossible would be applicable that is, the law in general\\n\\nexcuses a party which is disabled to perform a duty and impossibility of\\n\\nperformance of a duty is a good excuse.

It is\\n\\nurged, therefore, that it is imperative that the period during which the\\n\\nState or the acquiring authority was prohibited/ injuncted by an interim\\n\\norder of the court from taking possession has to be excluded. This\\n\\nprinciple, submit learned counsel, is based on settled common law\\n\\nprinciples. These are in fact rules of equity, justice and sound logic. In\\n\\nthe absence of their being a prohibition in the law these principles would\\n\\nbe attracted. The efficacy and binding nature of such common law\\n\\n\\n40   1988 Suppl (1) SCR 01\\n41   2014 (2) SCC 62\\n42   1959 Supp (1) SCR 639\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_113\\\">\\f                                    38</span>\\n\\nprinciples cannot be diminished or whittled down in the absence of any\\n\\nexpress prohibition in law. Coupled with the aforesaid principle is also\\n\\na principle of restitution. An interim order passed by the Court merges\\n\\ninto the final decision, goes against the party successful at the interim\\n\\nstage. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the successful party at\\n\\nthe end of the litigation would be justified in being placed in the same\\n\\nplace in which it would have been, had the interim order not been\\n\\npassed.

Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel, led the arguments on\\n\\nbehalf of landowners.      He urged that the Act of 2013 is a new,\\n\\ntransformative and radical measure. The new law is a welfare state law,\\n\\nnot a colonial law - unlike the Act of 1894. Mr. Divan submitted that\\n\\nthe Act of 1894 resulted in several rounds of repeated litigation on\\n\\nvarious aspect, such as payment of compensation, lack of legislatively\\n\\nmandated timelines for completion of acquisition proceedings, etc. This\\n\\nalso resulted in amendments to the Act of 1894 (notably, the\\n\\namendments of 1967 and 1984) which, to some extent, sought to grant\\n\\nrelief to landowners. However, these too got mired in litigation. Learned\\n\\ncounsel relied on the judgments, reported as <a href=\\\"/doc/1992267/\\\" id=\\\"a_245\\\">Dev Sharan v State of Uttar\\n\\nPradesh45</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1002007/\\\" id=\\\"a_246\\\">Radhey Shyam v State of UP46</a>. Repeated litigation was\\n\\nthe result of an unfair legal regime. It was submitted that such\\n\\njudgments of this Court highlighted that the Act of 1894 was enacted\\n\\nmore than 116 years ago to facilitate acquisition of land and immovable\\n\\nproperties for construction of roads, canals, railways, etc. This law was\\n\\nfrequently used in the post-independence era for different public\\n\\npurposes like laying of roads, construction of bridges, dams and\\n\\nbuildings of various public establishments/institutions, planned\\n\\ndevelopment of urban areas, providing of houses to different sections of\\n\\nthe society and for developing residential colonies/sectors. In the recent\\n\\nyears, there is acquisition of large tracts of land in rural parts of the\\n\\n\\n\\n45   (2011) 4 SCC 769\\n46   (2011) 5 SCC 553\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_120\\\">\\f                                    40</span>\\n\\ncountry in the name of development and their transfer to private\\n\\nentrepreneurs, who utilize it to construction of multi-storied complexes,\\n\\ncommercial centres and for setting up industrial units. Similarly, large\\n\\nscale acquisitions were made on behalf of companies by invoking the\\n\\nprovisions contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_247\\\">Part VII of the Act</a>. Resultantly, such acquisition\\n\\nled to deprivation of the source of livelihood of land owners, engaged in\\n\\nagricultural operations and other ancillary activities in rural areas. A\\n\\nlarge number of these people are unaware of, and unable to assert their\\n\\nrights, and secure fair compensation. The unrest and inequity which\\n\\narose out of these deprivations, impelled the State to enact a modern\\n\\nlaw, which ensured not only fair compensation, but other rights such\\n\\nas rehabilitation, employment, higher solatium and a guarantee against\\n\\ndeprivation of certain kinds of lands. Thus, the Act of 2013 ushered a\\n\\nnew regime that starts from a fresh direction.</span></span> Learned counsel also\\n\\nrelied on Bharat Sewak Samaj v. Lieutnant Governor &amp; Ors.,47 to say that\\n\\nthe provisions of the Act of 1894 were outdated and were misused and\\n\\nwere oppressive to the interest of the landowners. Hence, the Act of\\n\\n2013 was enacted and that this Court ought to interpret in the spirit of\\n\\nthe new beneficial legislation. Learned counsel urged that the benefits\\n\\nso conferred should not be taken away by this Court by narrowly\\n\\ninterpreting its provisions.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_89\\\">\\n\\n\\n47   2012 (12) SCC 675\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_121\\\">\\f                                     41</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_90\\\">54.

Furthermore, it was argued\\n\\nthat the non-obstante clause must be allowed to operate with full vigour\\n\\nin its own field. It was stressed that such a provision is equivalent to\\n\\nsaying that in spite of the provision or Act mentioned in the non-\\n\\nobstante clause, the enactment following it, will have its full operation\\n\\nof that, the provision indicated in the non-obstante clause will not be an\\n\\nimpediment for the operation of the enactment.

It was urged,\\n\\ntherefore, that actual tender of the amount of compensation is a sine\\n\\nqua non for the act of payment to be completed. It was considered that\\n\\nin that event, the land owner does not accept the amount, it should be\\n\\ndeposited with the Court, a neutral and independent authority to whom\\n\\nthe land owner or anyone claiming under him can approach and draw\\n\\nthe amount.

Here, it was\\n\\nurged that Parliament was acutely alive of the fact that the previous\\n\\nland acquisition regime resulted in injurious and unconscionable delays\\n\\nin payment of compensation. Furthermore, even after awards were\\n\\nmade, possession was never taken. This led to a great deal of\\n\\nuncertainty as far as the land owners were concerned because they\\n\\ncould not move ahead in their life without compensation nor could they\\n\\ntake any steps to acquire new lands or properties. It was precisely to\\n\\naddress this mischief, rather a widespread one, that the Parliament\\n\\nwished to enact a “bright line approach” whereby all acquisitions which\\n\\ndid not culminate either in payment of compensation or taking over of\\n\\npossession in respect of awards made five or more years prior to\\n\\n1.1.2014 had to lapse. It was submitted that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_279\\\">Section 24(1)</a> provided a\\n\\nlimited window in that it saved some acquisitions, i.e., notably where\\n\\nawards had been made but further proceedings had not been taken or\\n\\nwhere awards had not been made in both cases less than 5 years prior\\n\\nto 1.1.2014. It was only in these two limited instances that acquisition\\n\\nproceedings were allowed to continue or preserved. Thus, Parliamentary\\n\\nintent was that in cases of all awards made five years or more prior to\\n\\nthe coming into force of the Act, if compensation was not paid or\\n\\npossession of the acquired land not taken, automatically, as a matter of\\n\\nlaw there was to be a lapse (of such acquisitions). This legal\\n\\nconsequence crystallised and was in consonance with the other\\n\\nprovisions of the Act of 2013. Arguing that if one were to take into\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_141\\\">\\f                                    46</span>\\n\\naccount this perspective, there can be no doubt that the expression\\n\\n“paid” cannot mean anything other than tendering of compensation and\\n\\nin the event of its refusal, or the three contingencies contemplated\\n\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_280\\\">Section 31(2)</a> of the Act of 1894, it is deposited in Court. If these\\n\\neventualities were not fulfilled and the amounts were merely kept back\\n\\nwith the Government by it, any compliance with some norms evolved as\\n\\npart of the treasury or financial code there could have been no payment\\n\\nor deposit in the eyes of law. Learned counsel submitted that this Court\\n\\nshould affirm the decision in Sukhbir Singh. It was also submitted that\\n\\nunless <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_281\\\">Section 31</a> of the 1894 Act which postulates the performance of\\n\\na public duty in a particular manner and (through stipulated three\\n\\neventualities), such duty could be said to be fulfilled only and only if\\n\\nthat procedure were followed. Learned counsel relied upon the\\n\\njudgment in Bharat Kumar, which noted that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_282\\\">Section 24(2)</a> has a\\n\\nbeneficial intent and begins with a non-obstante clause.

It was highlighted that\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_283\\\">Section 24(2)</a> achieved a two-fold purpose, i.e., to preserve acquisition\\n\\nproceedings initiated before the commencement of the Act and secondly,\\n\\nconferring rights upon the land owners and other parties which did not\\n\\nhitherto exist. Since these rights relate to the right to property which is\\n\\nguaranteed by <a href=\\\"/doc/120077007/\\\" id=\\\"a_284\\\">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution, full effect must be given\\n\\nto them rather than the construction which would destroy its very\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_142\\\">\\f                                   47</span>\\n\\npurpose. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"98408332\\\" id=\\\"span_143\\\">In support of this argument, learned counsel relied upon <a href=\\\"/doc/98408332/\\\" id=\\\"a_285\\\">Union\\n\\nof India v.

It was argued in this\\n\\nregard that in all the three drafts that the Bill (which ultimately\\n\\nculminated in the Act of 2013) went through53, the expression used\\n\\nconsistently was “but the physical possession”. In the three stages, the\\n\\nintent was to normally ensure that the acquisition proceedings pending\\n\\nfor a long time were to lapse. It was emphasised that in the first version,\\n\\ni.e., the Bill introduced on 5.9.2011, all acquisitions were deemed to\\n\\nhave lapsed regardless of whether the award was made or not, if\\n\\npossession were not taken and also in those cases where the awards\\n\\nwere not made.

Learned counsel stated that the third set of cases is where the\\n\\nland owners do not get any benefit under the Act of 2013 and the\\n\\nacquisition proceeds under the provisions of the Act of 1894. It was\\n\\nargued that these cases are covered by <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_304\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a> and to which\\n\\nneither <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_305\\\">section 24 (2)</a> nor the proviso applies. This covers situations\\n\\nwhere though an award has been passed five years prior to the\\n\\ncommencement of the Act, neither of the conditions for deemed lapsing\\n\\nare present. Mr. Divan urged that the provisions of the Act of 1894 will\\n\\ncontinue to apply without any benefit in terms of increased\\n\\ncompensation where an award is passed within 5 years of the\\n\\ncommencement of the Act of 2013 but the majority of landholders have\\n\\nbeen paid.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_106\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_107\\\">63.   Mr. Divan then urged that this understanding of the provisions of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_306\\\">Section 24</a> is based on established rules of interpretation i.e., first, the\\n\\ngolden rule of interpretation requiring the Court to interpret statutory\\n\\nprovisions literally. Second, the rule of purposive interpretation was to\\n\\nbe used, having regard to the object of the enactment, the purpose of\\n\\nthe law in seeking to correct historical injustices and the legislative\\n\\nintent to confer the benefit of the Act of 2013 on certain landholders\\n\\naffected by the regime under the Act of 1894. The third rule to be\\n\\nemployed, is the rule of harmonious interpretation, such that all words\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_150\\\">\\f                                           51</span>\\n\\nof the provision are given effect and no part of the provision is rendered\\n\\notiose; fourth, contemporaneous understanding of administrators\\n\\nresponsible for implementing a new law. Also an interpretation in such\\n\\na manner as to avoid inserting words, subtracting words, and avoids\\n\\nanomalies or absurdities was necessary. Lastly it was urged that giving\\n\\na deeming provision its natural effect, which in this case results in a\\n\\nrule of interpretation that the provisions of a beneficent legislation\\n\\nought to be interpreted in the case of ambiguity in favour of the\\n\\ncitizens.54\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_108\\\">64.    It was submitted that the interpretation of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_307\\\">Section 24</a> outlined\\n\\nabove gives the plain and natural meaning to the key expressions used\\n\\nin <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_308\\\">section 24</a> - “physical possession”, “paid”, and “deemed to have\\n\\nlapsed”.

It was contended as to the learned Solicitor\\n\\nGeneral’s submission that payment in terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_316\\\">Section 24</a> is complied\\n\\nwith if the amount is tendered to the landowners, overlooks the\\n\\nobligation of payment in terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_317\\\">Section 24</a> is only met if the amount\\n\\nis actually paid to the landowners. On the occurrence of the\\n\\ncontingencies mentioned in <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_318\\\">Section 31(2)</a> of the Act of 1894, it ought to\\n\\nbe deposited in the Reference Court as defined under <a href=\\\"/doc/147625098/\\\" id=\\\"a_319\\\">Section 3(d)</a> of the\\n\\nAct of 1894.

Mr. Divan argued that the\\n\\njudgments cited by the learned Solicitor General in this regard\\n\\nessentially deal with labour laws, and are inapplicable as these statutes\\n\\ndid not contain a provision such as <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_321\\\">Section 31</a> of the Act of 1894, which\\n\\nstrictly and precisely prescribes what is to be done in the event when\\n\\nthe payment is not accepted.</span>\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_156\\\">\\f                                    53</span><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_111\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_112\\\">66.   It was argued that no rules under the Act of 1894 contemplate\\n\\ndeposit in the treasury. Learned counsel submitted that standing\\n\\norders, which are merely administrative instructions issued for\\n\\nconducting monetary transactions of the State, have in some cases been\\n\\nconfused to be Rules framed under <a href=\\\"/doc/1061397/\\\" id=\\\"a_322\\\">Section 55</a> of the Act of 1894. The\\n\\nRules or the Standing Orders have not been produced and no evidence\\n\\nhas been furnished of compliance with the requirements of <a href=\\\"/doc/1061397/\\\" id=\\\"a_323\\\">Section 55</a>,\\n\\nsuch as notification in the Gazette. All learned counsel submitted that\\n\\nin any case, delegated/subordinate legislation cannot be inconsistent\\n\\nwith, or in any manner depart from the express and precise language of\\n\\nthe parent enactment.       Again, it was submitted that the State’s\\n\\nargument with respect to deposit of compensation amounts in the\\n\\ntreasury, is untenable, for two strong reasons: one, that <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_324\\\">Section 31</a> itself\\n\\ndirected the compensation to be deposited in the court. In the teeth of\\n\\nthis express position, the State cannot be heard to say that it could\\n\\nnevertheless “deposit” the amount in the treasury, which is nothing but\\n\\nkeeping the money with itself. It was secondly urged, that even\\n\\notherwise, the Act of 1894 visualized that in regard to matters not\\n\\nprovided expressly, rules could be made (<a href=\\\"/doc/1061397/\\\" id=\\\"a_325\\\">Section 55</a>).\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_113\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"195483504\\\" id=\\\"span_157\\\">67.   Learned counsel submitted that the State’s argument regarding\\n\\nthe interpretation of ‘physical possession’ to be possession as per the\\n\\nratio in <a href=\\\"/doc/195483504/\\\" id=\\\"a_326\\\">Banda Development Authority</a> (supra), is incorrect. It was\\n\\nsubmitted that it is important to take note of the conscious inclusion of\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_158\\\">\\f                                            54</span>\\n\\nthe word ‘physical’ in relation to possession. An important distinction\\n\\nis required to be drawn in respect of de jure / constructive / deemed\\n\\npossession and ‘physical’ possession.                 Even if it is conceded that\\n\\ndrawing of a Panchnama is a valid mode of initially taking possession of\\n\\nvast tracts of vacant land, the intention of the legislature is that over a\\n\\nperiod of five years, such possession must transform to evident and\\n\\ndemonstrable ‘physical’ possession i.e., the manifestation of actual\\n\\ncontrol and dominion over the subject land(s). Learned counsel relied\\n\\non several decisions in support of their argument that “physical\\n\\npossession” should be construed as actual physical possession, and not\\n\\nconstructive, or de jure possession, which in most cases is possession\\n\\non paper.55</span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_114\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1497995\\\" id=\\\"span_159\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1822935\\\" id=\\\"span_160\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1985622\\\" id=\\\"span_161\\\">68.

Second, where in the\\n\\nAct of 2013, the legislature did want to exclude the period of a stay or\\n\\ninjunction, it has done so by using express words such as in the proviso\\n\\nto <a href=\\\"/doc/1166255/\\\" id=\\\"a_341\\\">Section 19</a> and the explanation to <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_342\\\">Section 69</a> of the Act of 2013.\\n\\nThird, he submitted that the maxim “actus curiae neminem gravabit”\\n\\nwhich means that “the act of court shall prejudice no one” has no\\n\\napplication here, as this is a maxim which is applied generally as a\\n\\nprinciple of equity in individual cases to ensure that there is no\\n\\ninjustice. The maxim rarely, if ever, is applied to interpret a statute. Mr.\\n\\nDivan submitted that this Court has declined to rely on this maxim in\\n\\nat least two reported decisions - Padma Sundar Rao v.

Khandaka Jain Jewellers</a> 57.\\n\\nMr. Divan further placed reliance on Snell’s Equity (33rd Edition, 2015),\\n\\nwhich states that the maxim of equity is not a specific rule of principle\\n\\nof law. It is a statement of a broad theme which underlies equitable\\n\\n\\n56   (2002) 3 SCC 533\\n57   (2007) 14 SCC 339\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_166\\\">\\f                                            56</span>\\n\\nconcepts and principles and as a result, the utility of equitable maxims\\n\\nis limited.

The second is when\\n             a court is exercising an equitable discretion, and seeks to\\n             structure that exercise by referring to broader, underlying\\n             principles.”\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_25\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"819178\\\" id=\\\"span_167\\\">70.      Learned counsel further placed reliance on a three-judge Bench\\n\\ndecision of this Court in <a href=\\\"/doc/819178/\\\" id=\\\"a_344\\\">The Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Parson Tools\\n\\nand Plants58</a>, where it was held that:</span>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_26\\\">             ‘If the Legislature wilfully omits to incorporate something of an\\n             analogous law in a subsequent statute, or even if there is a casus\\n             omissus in a statute, the language of which is otherwise plain\\n             and unambiguous, the Court is not competent to supply the\\n             omission by engrafting on it or introducing in it, under the guise\\n             of interpretation, by analogy or implication, something what it\\n             thinks to be a general principle of justice and equity.’\\n\\n\\n\\n         It was submitted that there is no occasion for excluding time spent\\n\\non litigation.

Had a date been so\\n\\nspecified, there would have been no occasion to exclude time. Instead\\n\\nof specifying a particular date, the Legislature in the Act of 2013\\n\\nprescribed the cut-off point with reference to the commencement of the\\n\\nAct. This method of specifying the cut-off point would not attract the\\n\\nmaxim “actus curiae neminem gravabit”. It was argued that the occasion\\n\\nfor excluding time would arise only where there is a starting point and\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_116\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"1281413\\\" id=\\\"span_168\\\">58   (1975) 4 SCC 22\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_169\\\">\\f                                         57</span>\\n\\na statutory period to complete the task. In such provisions, it may be\\n\\nreasonable to provide for the exclusion of time by appropriate language\\n\\nin the section. Here, where a cut-off date is prescribed and as such there\\n\\nis no starting point and period for completion of the task, the notion of\\n\\nexcluding time spent in litigations is an alien concept. It was, therefore,\\n\\nsubmitted that it is not the court’s business to stretch the words used\\n\\nby the Legislature to fill in gaps or omit words used in the provisions of\\n\\nan Act, i.e., to fill in an obvious and conscious exclusion of a\\n\\ncontingency, or a casus omissus. In support of this submission, learned\\n\\ncounsel relied on decisions of this Court.59 It was also argued that this\\n\\nCourt should not also exclude any period or periods, spent in litigation,\\n\\nwhen interim orders were operating, because, firstly, in each such\\n\\ninstance, the landowners were aggrieved by different kinds of arbitrary\\n\\nbehaviour, such as not providing opportunity of mandatory hearing\\n\\n(under an absolutely absurd rejection of objections; failure to take note\\n\\nof actual developmental needs, and taking of lands, unconnected with\\n\\na public purpose, or obvious instances of expropriation of utilities and\\n\\namenities such as schools, community assets, etc. These led the courts,\\n\\non a prima facie consideration to assess the merit in the challenge and\\n\\ngrant interim orders. Such instances could not be called as frivolous\\n\\nlitigation, warranting exclusion of time, to deprive the benefit of lapsing,\\n\\nenjoined by the new law. Secondly, it was argued that repeated attempts\\n\\n\\n\\n59G. Narayanswami v. G.

However, such amendment could not pass muster.</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_117\\\">71.   Learned counsel contended that Parliament’s intent is to confer a\\n\\nbenefit on landholders who were impacted by the erstwhile unfair\\n\\nregime. Urging that under the old law, landholders, to protect their\\n\\nassets from expropriation of their land at paltry amounts, were\\n\\ncompelled to use legitimate systems of securing redress by filing cases\\n\\nin court, counsel urged that the correct approach, is to view litigation\\n\\nas a necessity under an unjust former regime and not exclude the period\\n\\nspent under litigation in such an unfair regime. He further urged that\\n\\nthe deeming provision with its clear and verifiable benchmarks on the\\n\\nfive-year cut-off period, physical possession and payment is easy to\\n\\noperate. Introducing notions such as exclusion of time due to pending\\n\\nlitigation would complicate the working of the statute.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_118\\\">72.   Learned counsel urged that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_347\\\">Section 24(2)</a> uses the expression “or”.\\n\\nThe Legislature intended the two conditions separated by the word “or”\\n\\nto be alternative conditions. Four situations arise where the conditions\\n\\nare disjunctive: firstly, when physical possession is with the State and\\n\\ncompensation is with the citizen, there is no deemed lapse; secondly,\\n\\nwhen physical possession is with the citizen and compensation is with\\n\\nthe State, there is no need for restitution as the State has retained the\\n\\ncompensation amount; thirdly, when physical possession is with the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_171\\\">\\f                                    59</span>\\n\\ncitizen, and the compensation is also with the citizen, in such scenarios,\\n\\nthe citizen must return the compensation. It was urged that where the\\n\\nState has paid the money by deposit in the Reference Court and the\\n\\nmoney was lying with the Court, the State may withdraw the money on\\n\\ndeemed lapsing. However, if the State were to decide to acquire the land\\n\\nafresh, the compensation already paid may be adjusted; and further\\n\\nsince inherent in the notion of lapsing is the requirement for restitution,\\n\\nthe State can recover the compensation, inter alia by framing suitable\\n\\nrules. The citizen cannot retain compensation “had and received” since\\n\\nthis would amount to unjust enrichment. It was submitted that where\\n\\nthe physical possession as well as compensation are with the State, i.e.,\\n\\nwhere the State has taken possession without paying compensation as\\n\\nrequired under the Act of 1894, there is no absolute vesting free from\\n\\nall encumbrances as contemplated under <a href=\\\"/doc/562722/\\\" id=\\\"a_348\\\">Section 16</a>. In the absence of\\n\\nvesting, the State is required to restore possession to the citizen.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_119\\\">73.

The learned counsel submitted that\\n\\nreading the expression “or” as “and” not only does violence to the plain\\n\\nlanguage of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_349\\\">section 24(2)</a> but it also reduces the deeming provision\\n\\ndown to vanishing point.

It was further submitted that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_351\\\">Section 24</a>\\n\\ndoes not lay down any specific conditionality in terms of how far back\\n\\nin time the awards contemplated under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_352\\\">section 24(2)</a> could have been\\n\\nmade.

Supplementing the submissions, Mr. Dinesh Dwivedi, learned\\n\\nsenior counsel for the landowners, argued that the meaning of the\\n\\nphrase “compensation has not been paid” should be considered, given\\n\\nthat in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_361\\\">Section 24(2)</a> &quot;paid” is not used. The phrase &quot;has not been” is\\n\\nused in respect of both &quot;possession&quot; as well as &quot;paid”. Therefore, it must\\n\\nmean the same in both respects. The important factors to be borne in\\n\\nmind – and to distinguish the phrase “paid” from &quot;deposit&quot;, is whether\\n\\nin the court under <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_362\\\">Section 31 (2)</a> or in the treasury under <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_363\\\">Section 31(1)</a>.\\n\\nIt is urged that an analysis of <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_364\\\">Sections 17 (3A)</a> &amp; (3B), 31 (1) &amp; (2) and\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1945807/\\\" id=\\\"a_365\\\">Section 28</a> read with <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_366\\\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1894 shows that these\\n\\nprovisions clearly distinguish between tender, paid or deposit whether\\n\\nin the court or the treasury.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_124\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_125\\\">76.   Learned counsel argued that three different words used in the\\n\\nsame Act, in various provisions of the Act, cannot mean the same. It\\n\\nfollows also from the reading of <a href=\\\"/doc/432865/\\\" id=\\\"a_367\\\">Section 19(1)(c)</a> and (cc). In both these\\n\\nprovisions word &quot;tender” is used in contrast to word &quot;paid” while word\\n\\npaid is used in contrast to word &quot;deposit&quot;. The word &quot;deposit&quot;, wherever\\n\\nused, is in the context of &quot;deposit in Court&quot; only not treasury. The\\n\\nexpression &quot;tender payment” under <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_368\\\">Section 17 (3A)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_369\\\">Section 31(1)</a> of\\n\\nthe Act of 1894 were followed by the words &quot;pay it to them”. Therefore,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_180\\\">\\f                                     62</span>\\n\\ntender cannot mean &quot;paid”. It is urged that these terms fall in <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_370\\\">Part V of\\n\\nthe Act</a>, titled as &quot;Payment”. The term &quot;pay it to them” under <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_371\\\">Section 31</a>\\n\\nafter &quot;tender&quot; must mean an additional action or step. When after\\n\\n&quot;tender&quot; an effort is made &quot;to pay” the compensation and the same is\\n\\naccepted by the beneficiary, it becomes &quot;paid”. The &quot;deposit&quot; under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_372\\\">Section 31(2)</a> only comes in when the beneficiary declines payment.\\n\\nThis clearly implies that &quot;tender of payment&quot; cannot be equated with\\n\\n&quot;pay it to them&quot; or &quot;deposit in Court&quot; under <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_373\\\">Section 31(1)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_374\\\">31 (2)</a>. It is\\n\\nargued that what follows is that tender of payment by itself is not\\n\\nenough. The State’s interpretation is contested as incorrect because if\\n\\ntender is equal to being paid then why does legislature provide for\\n\\n&quot;deposit in court&quot;. The amount is deemed to be paid on tender and the\\n\\nobligation to pay is discharged then the question is why require &quot;deposit\\n\\nin Court&quot;. Learned counsel argued that “Tender&quot; can never be deemed\\n\\nas &quot;paid”: This is not only evident from reading of <a href=\\\"/doc/1166255/\\\" id=\\\"a_375\\\">Section 19(c)</a> where\\n\\nthe term &quot;paid or tendered” is depicted as alternates. Similarly, &quot;paid or\\n\\ndeposited&quot; are used alternately. Likewise, <a href=\\\"/doc/150567807/\\\" id=\\\"a_376\\\">Sections 17(3)(b)</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/1166255/\\\" id=\\\"a_377\\\">19(cc)</a> and\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_378\\\">34</a> use these words alternately. As said above if &quot;tender” would amount\\n\\nto &quot;paid” and then the compensation would be deemed to be paid,\\n\\nresulting in discharge of obligation to pay, then why deposit in court\\n\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_379\\\">Section 31(2)</a> to make it &quot;custodia legis&quot;. <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_380\\\">Section 31(2)</a> would\\n\\nbecome redundant in most of the cases.\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_181\\\">\\f                                    63</span><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_126\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_127\\\">77.   Learned counsel conceded that there is no doubt that on a decline\\n\\nof payment by the beneficiary it has to be mandatorily deposited in\\n\\nCourt under <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_381\\\">Section 31(2)</a>. The provision uses the phrase &quot;shall deposit&quot;\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_27\\\">and this gives a valuable right to the payee, not only of interest in the\\n\\nevent it is not &quot;deposited in court&quot; but also a right to seek investment of\\n\\ncompensation under <a href=\\\"/doc/1362441/\\\" id=\\\"a_382\\\">Section 33</a>. These statutory rights are adversely\\n\\naffected if &quot;deposit” is not in “court&quot;. Therefore, it is amply clear that\\n\\n&quot;deposit in treasury is not an option available. It cannot be a substitute\\n\\nfor &quot;deposit in Court&quot;. Besides <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_383\\\">Section 31(1)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_384\\\">31 (2)</a> of the Act of 1894\\n\\npresent a complete code for payment and there is no gap or uncovered\\n\\narea to permit rules to supplement. Any deposit in treasury was in\\n\\nbreach of <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_385\\\">Section 31</a> and therefore, impermissible. Also, most of the\\n\\nStates had no rules under <a href=\\\"/doc/1061397/\\\" id=\\\"a_386\\\">Section 55</a>. In this context, executive\\n\\ninstructions cannot prevail over law. Law can never be interpreted with\\n\\nthe aid of subordinate legislation or executive instructions. It was\\n\\nfurther submitted that <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_387\\\">Sections 17(3A)</a> and (3B), 28, 31, 33 and 34 of\\n\\nthe Act of 1894 are a clear pointer that &quot;tender&quot; is not &quot;paid” and neither\\n\\nis &quot;deposit&quot;. Likewise, these provisions frequently use words “paid or\\n\\ndeposited” which shows they are different. Deposit cannot be, therefore,\\n\\nequated with paid as they are more than once separated by word &#x27;or&#x27;.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_128\\\">78.   It was contended that the scheme of the Act of 1894 was clear and\\n\\ncategorical that the amount of compensations when accepted by the\\n\\nbeneficiary is deemed to be &quot;paid” for interest to stop running. The\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_182\\\">\\f                                     64</span>\\n\\nrunning of interest under <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_388\\\">Section 34</a> denotes non-discharge of\\n\\nobligation to pay, otherwise why pay interest? The &quot;deposit in Court&quot; may\\n\\nstop running of interest and therefore, may for this purpose be taken to\\n\\nbe paid, but when it comes to actual meaning in the above provisions,\\n\\n&quot;paid and deposit” are invariably separated by the use of word “or” in\\n\\nbetween them. Therefore, it is submitted that when Section 24(2) of the\\n\\nNew Act uses the phrase &quot;compensation has not been paid” it uses the\\n\\nterminology of the proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_389\\\">Section 34(proviso)</a> and must have the\\n\\nsame meaning &quot;has not been paid” cannot be read as &quot;has not been\\n\\ndeposited&quot;. If this is the right interpretation than the coverage of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_390\\\">Section\\n\\n24(2)</a> also expands to cover those cases in which the compensation has\\n\\nnot been actually paid but has been deposited in the Court. This would\\n\\nalso be in keeping with the legislative policy contained in the Preamble,\\n\\nto give just and fair compensation to those whose lands have been\\n\\nacquired as per the <a href=\\\"/doc/82964342/\\\" id=\\\"a_391\\\">Old Act</a>. Coverage of the New Act is co-related to\\n\\npersons whose &quot;land has been acquired”. The policy of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_392\\\">Section 24</a> also\\n\\nreflects this expansive liberal approach of &quot;just and fair compensation&quot;.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_393\\\">Section 24</a> would therefore have to be seen in the light of this liberal\\n\\npolicy intent.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_129\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_130\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"421654\\\" id=\\\"span_183\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"51689837\\\" id=\\\"span_184\\\">79.   It was urged that these States’ arguments regarding revival of\\n\\nclaims or resulting in impossible situations causing irreparable harm\\n\\nare not very relevant once the legislative policy is clear. The provision\\n\\nhas to be interpreted in a manner that it subserves the legislative policy\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_185\\\">\\f                                     65</span>\\n\\nintent of giving just and fair compensation to those whose lands were\\n\\nacquired (possession taken) under the Act of 1894. Once the legislative\\n\\npolicy or intent is clear then the objections relating to harsh\\n\\nconsequences are not really relevant. It was stated that State may be\\n\\nput into a difficult situation, but the solution too is provided in the last\\n\\npart of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_394\\\">Section 24(2)</a> which reflects the words &quot;if it so chooses”, it can\\n\\nacquire afresh under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_395\\\">Section 24</a>. Learned counsel relied on Padma\\n\\nSunder Rao (supra); <a href=\\\"/doc/51689837/\\\" id=\\\"a_396\\\">Popat Bahiru Govardhane v. Land Acquisition\\n\\nOfficer61</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/421654/\\\" id=\\\"a_397\\\">B. Premanand v. Mohan Koikal62</a>. It was urged that the\\n\\nlegislative policy may cause hardship or difficulties to some or the State\\n\\nmay be put to an impossible situation; yet cannot take away from\\n\\nParliamentary intent. Parliament has enough wisdom to know these\\n\\ndifficulties, the law prevailing earlier or the ground realities. It would be\\n\\ndeemed to be not only aware of the difficulties, but also to have assessed\\n\\nthem while framing the liberalised policy. The question is one of intent.\\n\\nThe intent has to be seen primarily from the words used in the text. It\\n\\nis only if such intent is not clear that courts have to see them with the\\n\\naid of the context. The difficulties as well as harsh consequences cannot\\n\\nbe utilized to assess the intent embedded in the provision if they are\\n\\nclear, otherwise from the text, or the context. Not only has Parliament\\n\\nnot provided any clause creating any kind of exception, or extension of\\n\\nfive years in cases of litigating land oustees who may have an interim\\n\\n\\n\\n61   2003 (10) SCC 765\\n62   (2011) 4 SCC 266\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_186\\\">\\f                                    66</span>\\n\\norders in their favour, stalling the acquisition or payment of\\n\\ncompensation. All that the provision says is &quot;or compensation has not\\n\\nbeen paid”. The projected policy intent is broad and unencumbered by\\n\\nany exception. This is a clearest indicator of legislative intent to cover\\n\\nall such cases that may cause hardship to the State or may be due to\\n\\nthe fault of Court or the litigious land oustee. The intent is clear and\\n\\ntherefore, has to be read apart from difficulties or hardships.</span></span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_131\\\">80.   It is submitted that the State’s contention with regard to a\\n\\ndifferential approach for possession and compensation is irrational and\\n\\nis against the very grain of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_398\\\">Section 24(2)</a> and is also unreasonable and\\n\\ndiscriminatory. It is unreasonable because there are hardly any cases\\n\\nwhere compensation may have been paid, yet possession may not have\\n\\nbeen taken. Most of the cases are under <a href=\\\"/doc/423817/\\\" id=\\\"a_399\\\">Section 17(1)</a> where possession\\n\\nis invariably taken while compensation remains unpaid as award is not\\n\\nmade. By reading word &#x27;or&#x27; as &#x27;and&#x27;, the words &quot;or the compensation has\\n\\nnot been paid&quot; become otiose or redundant. Parliament could have only\\n\\nsaid that lapsing would occur only if possession has not been taken,\\n\\nbecause if possession is taken then there would never be lapsing and\\n\\nthere would be no need to consider &quot;or&quot; as &quot;and”. Therefore, such an\\n\\ninterpretation (i.e., reading “or” conjunctively) is contrary to every rule\\n\\nof interpretation and contrary to the Legislative policy indicated in the\\n\\nPreamble of giving just and fair compensation in cases of earlier\\n\\nacquisitions, which includes cases where possession has been taken.\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_187\\\">\\f                                    67</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_132\\\">81.   Learned counsel urged that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_400\\\">Section 24(2)</a> would become\\n\\ndiscriminatory if &quot;or&quot; is read as &quot;and”. For this, it would be necessary to\\n\\nanalyse <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_401\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a>. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_402\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> applies to a situation where\\n\\nthere is no award made till the commencement of the New Act. No award\\n\\nprimarily means &quot;compensation has not been paid”. Importantly in a\\n\\ncase under <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_403\\\">Section 17</a> of the Act of 1894, which is most frequently\\n\\nutilised,   possession   may   be   taken   before   award is   made    or\\n\\ncompensation is paid. In other words, <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_404\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> does visualize or\\n\\ncover cases where possession may have been taken but “compensation\\n\\nhas not been paid&quot;. It, therefore, requires re-determination of\\n\\ncompensation under Sections 26-30 of the New Act. The problems of\\n\\nwho to pay the enhanced compensation, as <a href=\\\"/doc/421654/\\\" id=\\\"a_405\\\">referred above</a>, would also\\n\\narise in this situation. Yet Parliament has ignored these difficulties and\\n\\nprovided for redetermination. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_406\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> may travel back to period\\n\\nof five years or more, or may be 10-15 years as in case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_407\\\">Section 24(2)</a>.\\n\\nIt would not be reasonable to restrict the retrospectivity of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_408\\\">Section\\n\\n24(1)(a)</a> with the aid of Section 11A of the old Act, to 2 years before\\n\\ncommencement. It would be incorrect because then one would be\\n\\nignoring Explanation to Section 11A (proviso). The said Explanation\\n\\nvisualises indefinite extension of the period of award from 2 years. It\\n\\nwould not be, therefore, reasonable to exclude such cases where though\\n\\npossession may have been taken, but compensation may not have been\\n\\npaid for a very long period of time upto commencement of the new Act.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_409\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> does not contain any provision like <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_410\\\">Section 25 (proviso)</a>,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_188\\\">\\f                                     68</span>\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1166255/\\\" id=\\\"a_411\\\">Section 19(7)(proviso)</a> and Section 69(2)(explanation) and therefore, is\\n\\nwide in its coverage in the absence of exceptions as above.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_133\\\">82.   Learned counsel urged that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_412\\\">Section 24(2)</a> is a special provision\\n\\ngiving higher benefit because in the cases covered by <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_413\\\">Section 24(2)</a>\\n\\n&quot;compensation has not been paid” despite award. Would it be rational\\n\\nto read <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_414\\\">Section 24(2)</a> in such a manner that deprives it of its value and\\n\\nworth and makes it ineffective. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_415\\\">Section 24(2)</a> would become ineffective\\n\\nas a whole because there would be rarest of the rare cases, where both\\n\\nthe conditions would be fulfilled. The experience shows in vast majority\\n\\nof cases of acquisition under the old Act, possession is taken while\\n\\naward &amp; compensation come much later. This is because <a href=\\\"/doc/1990166/\\\" id=\\\"a_416\\\">Sections 9</a> &amp;\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_417\\\">17(6)</a> of the Act of 1894 were used in vast majority of acquisitions and\\n\\nthe Legislature was aware of it. The law does not compel doing of an act\\n\\nthat is impossible. It is emphasized that the principle does not apply as\\n\\nthe new Act is not requiring any such performance. The new Act after\\n\\nrecognising the past, is providing new solutions, rights and benefits.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_418\\\">Section 24(2)</a> by itself does not compel performance of an impossible\\n\\nact. This principle could have been relevant during earlier Act but is\\n\\nhardly relevant for interpreting the scope of Section 24(2) of the New\\n\\nAct. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_419\\\">Section 24</a> clearly postulates that even though the Act may be\\n\\nimpossible of performance, or results in undue advantage to the\\n\\nbeneficiary despite his fault in declining, yet benefit of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_420\\\">Section 24(2)</a> may\\n\\nbe given without creating any exception.       There is no constitutional\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_189\\\">\\f                                            69</span>\\n\\nrestriction on the Legislature that such cases or situations have to be\\n\\nexcluded. The legislature can provide benefit in the same manner to all,\\n\\ndifficulties apart. Reliance is placed on certain decisions in support of\\n\\nthis proposition.63 Therefore, such interpretation which excludes the\\n\\nbenefits under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_421\\\">Section 24(2)</a> by resorting to such arguments of\\n\\ndifficulties is meaningless. The giving of benefit to all by ignoring above\\n\\ncircumstance is neither illegal nor unjust. It is neither anomalous nor\\n\\nabsurd. It is urged that what the court feels is not important; what is\\n\\nrelevant is the view of the legislature, to be culled out from the reading\\n\\nof only the text or the context; not in any other manner. For this rule,\\n\\nreliance was placed on Mohd. Kavi v.

It is argued that\\n\\nSection 114 consists of two sections (1) a repeal clause set out in Section\\n\\n114 (1); and (2) a savings clause set out in Section 114(2). It is\\n\\ncontended that there is a distinction in the manner in which a repealing\\n\\nclause is construed as compared to the manner in which a savings\\n\\nclause is construed. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"1470235\\\" id=\\\"span_195\\\">While a repealing clause, followed by a new\\n\\nlegislation on the same subject-matter would result in a line of enquiry\\n\\nabout what rights are obliterated under the old Act by the new Act, a\\n\\nsavings clause would be construed in a manner that resurrects a\\n\\nprovision, which would otherwise be obliterated on account of the\\n\\nrepeal. In relation to a repeal clause, the effect of obliterating the\\n\\nprovisions of the previous enactment would be as if it never existed,\\n\\nexcept for vested rights, which would be protected under <a href=\\\"/doc/1030013/\\\" id=\\\"a_430\\\">Section 6</a> of\\n\\nthe General Clauses Act. <a href=\\\"/doc/1030013/\\\" id=\\\"a_431\\\">Section 6</a> of the General Clauses Act, thus\\n\\noperated as a savings clause.

It was stated, that retaining\\n\\namounts in the treasury, pursuant to executive rules would not suffice\\n\\nfor compliance with the payment condition. Learned counsel also urged\\n\\nthat this court should interpret &quot;or&quot; as signifying a disjunctive reading\\n\\nof the two conditions. Comparing this legal fiction created under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_449\\\">Section\\n\\n24(2)</a> with the State’s obligations under the Act of 1894 would be\\n\\ninconsistent with the decisions of this Court, under which legal fictions\\n\\nare to be read as it is i.e., the state of affairs as plainly set out in the\\n\\nlegal fiction. Therefore, the effect of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_450\\\">Section 24 (2)</a> is that if either of the\\n\\nsituations are not met, the acquisition proceedings under the Act of\\n\\n1894 lapse and the State can initiate proceedings afresh in accordance\\n\\nwith the Act of 2013. This construction, urge learned counsel is also\\n\\npurposive and practical. If the State has not taken physical possession\\n\\nof a property even if compensation has been paid for over 5 years prior\\n\\nto the commencement of the Act of 2013, because it no longer serves\\n\\nthe purpose of acquisition, it can drop the proceedings as those would\\n\\nhave lapsed. In such an event, the State would naturally be entitled to\\n\\nrestitutory recovery. However, if the State has failed to take physical\\n\\npossession, it cannot be benefited by its inactions and must restart\\n\\nproceedings under the Act of 2013. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"132996988\\\" id=\\\"span_199\\\">In such a case, the compensation\\n\\npaid can always be re-adjusted against compensation determined under\\n\\nthe Act of 2013. Arguendo, it is urged that even if Section 114 (2) of the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_200\\\">\\f                                             75</span>\\n\\nAct of 2013 is construed to keep alive the State’s vested rights by virtue\\n\\nof <a href=\\\"/doc/1030013/\\\" id=\\\"a_451\\\">Section 6</a> of the General Clauses Act, such rights are limited by\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_452\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_453\\\">Section 24(2)</a> of the Act of 2013.

The definition of the expression &quot;public purpose&quot; as given in the\\nAct is very wide. It has, therefore, become necessary to re-define\\nit so as to restrict its scope for acquisition of land for strategic\\npurposes vital to the State, and for infrastructure projects where\\nthe benefits accrue to the general public. The provisions of the Act\\nare also used for acquiring private lands for companies. This\\nfrequently raises a question mark on the desirability of such State\\nintervention when land could be arranged by the company\\nthrough private negotiations on a &quot;willing seller-willing buyer&quot;\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_63\\\">basis, which could be seen to be a more fair arrangement from\\nthe point of view of the land owner. In order to streamline the\\nprovisions of the Act causing less hardships to the owners of the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_208\\\">\\f                                 81</span>\\n\\nland and other persons dependent upon such land, it is proposed\\nrepeal the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_484\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, LA and to replace it with\\nadequate provisions for rehabilitation and resettlement for the\\naffected persons and their families.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_64\\\">3. There have been multiple amendments to the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_485\\\">Land Acquisition\\nAct</a>, LA not only by the Central Government but by the State\\nGovernments as well. Further, there has been heightened public\\nconcern on land acquisition, especially multi-cropped irrigated\\nland and there is no central law to adequately deal with the\\nissues of rehabilitation and resettlement of displaced persons. As\\nland acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement need to be\\nseen as two sides of the same coin, a single integrated law to\\ndeal with the issues of land acquisition and rehabilitation and\\nresettlement has become necessary. Hence the proposed\\nlegislation proposes to address concerns of farmers and those\\nwhose livelihoods are dependent on the land being acquired,\\nwhile at the same time facilitating land acquisition for\\nindustrialization, infrastructure and urbanization projects in a\\ntimely and transparent manner.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_65\\\">4. Earlier, the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007 and\\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2007 were introduced in the\\nLok Sabha on 6th December 2007 and were referred to the\\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Rural Development for\\nExamination and Report. The Standing Committee presented its\\nreports (the 39th and 40th Reports) to the Lok Sabha on 21st\\nOctober 2008 and laid the same in the Rajya Sabha on the same\\nday. Based on the recommendations of the Standing Committee\\nand as a consequence thereof, official amendments to the Bills\\nwere proposed. The Bills, along with the official amendments,\\nwere passed by the Lok Sabha on 25th February 2009, but the\\nsame lapsed with the dissolution of the 14th Lok Sabha.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_66\\\">5. It is now proposed to have a unified legislation dealing with\\nacquisition of land, provide for just and fair compensation and\\nmake adequate provisions for rehabilitation and resettlement\\nmechanism for the affected persons and their families. The Bill\\nthus provides for repealing and replacing the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_486\\\">Land Acquisition\\nAct</a>, LA with broad provisions for adequate rehabilitation and\\nresettlement mechanism for the project affected persons and their\\nfamilies.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_67\\\">6. Provision of public facilities or infrastructure often requires the\\nexercise of powers by the State for acquisition of private property\\nleading to displacement of people, depriving them of their land,\\nlivelihood, and shelter, restricting their access to traditional\\nresource base and uprooting them from their socio-cultural\\nenvironment. These have traumatic, psychological, and socio-\\ncultural consequences on the affected population, which call for\\nprotecting their rights, particularly in case of the weaker sections\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_209\\\">\\f                                 82</span>\\n\\nof the society, including members of the Scheduled Castes (SCs),\\nthe Scheduled Tribes (STs), marginal farmers and their families.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_68\\\">7. There is an imperative need to recognise rehabilitation and\\nresettlement issues as intrinsic to the development process\\nformulated with the active participation of affected persons and\\nfamilies. Additional benefits beyond monetary compensation\\nhave to be provided to families affected adversely by involuntary\\ndisplacement. The plight of those who do not have rights over the\\nland on which they are critically dependent for their subsistence\\nis even worse. This calls for a broader concerted effort on the part\\nof the planners to include in the displacement, rehabilitation, and\\nresettlement process framework, not only for those who directly\\nlose their land and other assets but also for all those who are\\naffected by such acquisition. The displacement process often\\nposes problems that make it difficult for the affected persons to\\ncontinue their traditional livelihood activities after resettlement.\\nThis requires a careful assessment of the economic\\ndisadvantages and the social impact arising out of displacement.\\nThere must also be holistic effort aimed at improving the all-round\\nliving standards of the affected persons and families.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_69\\\">8. A National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project\\nAffected Families was formulated in 2003, which came into force\\nwith effect from February 2004. Experience gained in\\nimplementation of this policy indicates that there are many issues\\naddressed by the policy which need to be reviewed. There should\\nbe a clear perception, through a careful quantification of the costs\\nand benefits that will accrue to society at large, of the desirability\\nand justifiability of each project. The adverse impact on affected\\nfamilies-economic, environmental, social and cultural-must be\\nassessed in participatory and transparent manner. A national\\nrehabilitation and resettlement framework thus needs to apply to\\nall projects where involuntary displacement takes place.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_70\\\">9. The National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy, 2007, has\\nbeen formulated on these lines to replace the National Policy on\\nResettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Families,\\n2003. The new policy has been notified in the Official Gazette and\\nhas become operative with effect from the 31st October, 2007.\\nMany State Governments have their own Rehabilitation and\\nResettlement Policies. Many Public Sector Undertakings or\\nagencies also have their own policies in this regard.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_71\\\">10. The law would apply when Government acquires land for its\\nown use, hold and control, or with the ultimate purpose to\\ntransfer it for the use of private companies for stated public\\npurpose or for immediate and declared use by private companies\\nfor public purpose. Only rehabilitation and resettlement\\nprovisions will apply when private companies buy land for a\\nproject, more than 100 acres in rural areas, or more than 50 acres\\nin urban areas. The land acquisition provisions would apply to\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_210\\\">\\f                                83</span>\\n\\nthe area to be acquired but the rehabilitation and resettlement\\nprovisions will apply to the entire project area even when private\\ncompany approaches Government for partial acquisition for\\npublic purpose.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_72\\\">11. “Public purpose” has been comprehensively defined, so that\\nGovernment intervention in acquisition is limited to defence,\\ncertain development projects only. It has also been ensured that\\nconsent of at least 80 per cent of the project affected families is\\nto be obtained through a prior informed process. Acquisition\\nunder urgency clause has also been limited for the purposes of\\nnational defence, security purposes, and Rehabilitation and\\nResettlement needs in the event of emergencies or natural\\ncalamities only.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_73\\\">12. To ensure food security, multi-crop irrigated land shall be\\nacquired only as a last resort measure. An equivalent area of\\nculturable wasteland shall be developed if multi-crop land is\\nacquired. In districts where net sown area is less than 50 per\\ncent of total geographical area, no more than 10 per cent of the\\nnet sown area of the district will be acquired.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_74\\\">13. To ensure comprehensive compensation package for the land\\nowners, a scientific method for calculation of the market value of\\nthe land has been proposed. Market value calculated will be\\nmultiplied by a factor of two in the rural areas. Solatium will also\\nbe increased upto 100 per cent of the total compensation. Where\\nland is acquired for urbanization, 20 per cent of the developed\\nland will be offered to the affected land owners.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_75\\\">14.

It is significant that the language of sub-clauses (ii) and (iii) of\\n              clause (b) is different. The former relates to a positive state of\\n              affairs whereas the latter lays down negative conditions. The\\n              word “or” is often used to express an alternative of terms defined\\n              or explanation of the same thing in different words. Therefore, if\\n              either of the two negative conditions which are to be found in sub-\\n              clause (b)(iii) remains unfulfilled, the conditions <a href=\\\"/doc/1036498/\\\" id=\\\"a_555\\\">laid down in</a> the\\n              entire clause cannot be said to have been satisfied. The clear\\n              import of the opening part of clause (b) with the word “and”\\n              appearing there read with the negative or disqualifying\\n              conditions in sub-clause (b)(iii) is that the assessee was bound to\\n              satisfy apart from the conditions contained in the other sub-\\n              clauses that its affairs were at no time during the previous year\\n              controlled by less than six persons and shares carrying more\\n              than 50 per cent of the total voting power were during the same\\n              period not held by less than six persons. We are unable to find\\n              any infirmity in the reasoning or the conclusion of the Tribunal\\n              and the High Court so far as question 1 is concerned.”\\n\\n\\n\\n         It was observed that if either of the two negative conditions, which\\n\\nare to be found in Sub-clause (b)(iii), remains unfulfilled, the conditions\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1036498/\\\" id=\\\"a_556\\\">laid down in</a> the entire clause cannot be said to have been satisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_172\\\">98.      It would also be useful to note that in Brown &amp; Co. v. Harrison75,\\n\\nthe provisions contained in Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924 came\\n\\nup for consideration before the Court of Appeal. The Court held that\\n\\nthe word “or” in Article IV, R 2 (q), must be read conjunctively and not\\n\\ndisjunctively. It has been observed that quite commonly collation of the\\n\\nwords “or” can be meant in conjunctive sense and certainly where the\\n\\ndisjunctive use of the word, leads to repugnance or absurdity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n75   (1927) All ER Rep 195 pp. 203, 204 (CA)\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_221\\\">\\f                                              93</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_173\\\">99.      In this Court’s considered view, as regards the collation of the\\n\\nwords used in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_557\\\">Section 24(2)</a>, two negative conditions have been\\n\\nprescribed. Thus, even if one condition is satisfied, there is no lapse,\\n\\nand this logically flows from the Act of 1894 read with the provisions of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_558\\\">Section 24</a> of the Act of 2013. Any other interpretation would entail\\n\\nillogical results. That apart, if the rule of interpretation with respect to\\n\\ntwo negative conditions qualified by “or” is used, then “or” should be\\n\\nread as “nor” or “and”. Brown &amp; Co. v. Harrison (supra), ruled thus,\\n\\nabout the interpretation of two negative conditions connected by the\\n\\nword &quot;or&quot;:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_92\\\">             “…..I think it quite commonly and grammatically can have a\\n             conjunctive sense.

Here, it is quite plain that the word leads to an absurdity,\\n             because the contention put forward by the shipowners in this\\n             matter amounts to this, as my Lord said, that, if a shipowner\\n             himself breaks open a case and steals the contents of it, he is\\n             exempted from liability under r 2(q) if none of his servants stole\\n             the part of the case or broke it open.

The Court observed thus:</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_100\\\">             &quot;27. The conclusion as well as the reasoning of the High Court\\n             that the permanent seat of the High Court is at Allahabad is not\\n             quite sound. The order states that the High Court shall sit as the\\n             new High Court and the judges and Division Bench thereof shall\\n             sit at Allahabad or at such other places in the United Provinces\\n             as the Chief Justice may, with the approval of the Governor of the\\n             United Provinces, appoint.

The mere fact that\\n             the results of a statute may be unjust does not entitle a court to\\n             refuse to give it effect. If there are two different interpretations of\\n             the words in an Act, the Court will adopt that which is just,\\n             reasonable and sensible rather than that which is none of those\\n             things.

On the plain language of the\\n             definition section, it is quite apparent that the words &quot;or is\\n             otherwise unfit for human consumption&quot; are disjunctive of the rest\\n             of the words preceding them. It relates to a distinct and separate\\n             class altogether. It seems to us that the last clause &quot;or is\\n             otherwise unfit for human consumption&quot; is residuary provision,\\n             which would apply to a case not covered by or falling squarely\\n\\n84   (1980) 1 SCC 158\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_243\\\">\\f                                 100</span>\\n\\nwithin the clauses preceding it.

In the definition clause, the collection of words &quot;filthy, putrid,\\nrotten, decomposed and insect-infested,&quot; which are adjectives\\nqualifying the term &quot;an article of food,&quot; show that it is not of the\\nnature, substance, and quality fit for human consumption. It will\\nbe noticed that there is a comma after each of the first three\\nwords. It should also be noted that these qualifying adjectives\\ncannot be read into the last portion of the definition i.e., the word&#x27;\\n&quot;or is otherwise unfit for human consumption,&quot; which is quite\\nseparate and distinct from others. The word &quot;otherwise&quot; signifies\\nunfitness for human consumption due to other causes. If the last\\nportion is meant to mean something different, it becomes difficult\\nto understand how the word &quot;or&quot; as used in the definition of\\n&quot;adulterated&quot; in <a href=\\\"/doc/331372/\\\" id=\\\"a_591\\\">Section 2(i)(f)</a> between &quot;filthy, putrid, rotten, etc.&quot;\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_189\\\">and &quot;otherwise unfit for human consumption&quot; could have been\\nintended to be used conjunctively.

In Stroud’s Judicial\\nDictionary, 3rd Edn., Vol. 1, it is stated at p. 135:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_104\\\">    “And” has generally a cumulative sense, requiring the\\nfulfilment of all the conditions that it joins together, and herein it\\nis the antithesis of “or”. Sometimes, however, even in such a\\nconnection, it is, by force of a context, read as “or”.\\nWhile dealing with the topic &#x27;OR is read as AND, and vice versa’,\\nStroud says in Vol. 3, at p. 2009:\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_105\\\">&quot;You will find it said in some cases that &#x27;or&#x27; means &#x27;and&#x27;; but &#x27;or&#x27;\\nnever does mean &#x27;and’.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_106\\\">Similarly, in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th Edn., pp.\\n229-30, it has been accepted that &quot;to carry out the intention of the\\nlegislature, it is occasionally found necessary to read the\\nconjunctions &#x27;or&#x27; and &#x27;and&#x27; one for the other.&quot; The word &quot;or&quot; is\\nnormally disjunctive and &quot;and&quot; is normally conjunctive, but at\\ntimes they are read as vice versa. As Scrutton, L.J. said in Green\\nv. Premier Glynrhonwy State Co., LR (1928) 1 KB 561, 568: &quot;You\\ndo sometimes read &quot;or&quot; as &quot;and&quot; in a statute . . . .

GROVE, J. The main question before us turns on the\\n        meaning of the word &quot;or,&quot; used in 25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 102, s.98. Read\\n        shortly, s. 98 enacts that no existing road, passage or way, shall\\n        be hereafter formed or laid out for carriage traffic unless such\\n        road shall be forty feet wide, or for the purposes of foot traffic,\\n        unless such road be of the width of twenty feet, or unless such\\n        streets respectively shall be open at both ends. The question is\\n        whether that word &quot;or&quot; should be read in the disjunctive or\\n        conjunctive, or perhaps read as either &quot;and&quot; or &quot;nor:&quot; I think it\\n        means &quot;nor;&quot; that is to say, that the two things comprised in the\\n        prohibition are both prohibited, and not merely prohibited in the\\n        alternative. If the sense which I attribute to the word is right, it\\n        would have been more strictly grammatical to have written &quot;nor&quot;\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_194\\\">        instead of &quot;or.&quot; But I think that the meaning of the enactment is\\n        that the road must be of the width specified, and that no road\\n        shall be allowed unless it is of the width specified, nor unless it\\n        is open at both ends. That seems to me to be the object of the\\n        statute, which was passed for sanitary purposes, and also for\\n        the purpose of comfort and traffic.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_195\\\">            It was contended that the object of the provision is sanitary\\n        only, and that if a street is forty feet wide, or if however narrow,\\n        it is open at both ends, good ventilation is secured. But a very\\n        long narrow street would hardly be more salubrious with both\\n        ends open than if one end were closed and the street were a cul\\n        de sac.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_196\\\">            Our construction of the Act is according to the ordinary use of\\n        language, although it may not be strictly grammatical. We might\\n        have referred to authorities by good writers, shewing that where\\n        the word &quot;or&quot; is preceded by a negative or prohibitory provision,\\n        it frequently has a different sense from that which it has when it\\n        is preceded by an affirmative provision. For instance, suppose\\n        an order that &quot;you must have your house either drained or\\n        ventilated.&quot;    The word &quot;or&quot; would be clearly used in the\\n        alternative. Suppose again, the order was that &quot;you must have\\n        your house drained or ventilated,&quot; that conveys the idea to my\\n        mind that you must have your house either drained or ventilated.\\n        But supposing the order were that &quot;you must not have your house\\n        undrained or unventilated.&quot; The second negative words are\\n        coupled by the word &quot;or,&quot; and the negative in the preceding\\n        sentence governs both. In s. 98 there is a negative preceding a\\n        sentence; &quot;no existing road&quot; shall be formed as a street for\\n        carriage traffic unless such road be widened to forty feet, or for\\n        the purposes of foot traffic only unless such road or way be\\n        widened to the width of twenty feet, &quot;or&quot; unless such streets shall\\n        be open at both ends. Probably, if the word &quot;or&quot; in the sentence,\\n        &quot;or for purposes of foot traffic only,&quot; had been written &quot;nor,&quot; the\\n        language there too would have been more clear and more\\n        decidedly prohibitory; but with regard to the sentence &quot;or unless\\n        such streets shall be open at both ends&quot; I think that by reading\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_248\\\">\\f                                         103</span>\\n\\n         the word &quot;or&quot; as &quot;nor&quot; we carry out the intention of the Act, which\\n         was to have streets of a proper width and properly opened at\\n         both ends, and that there should not be incommodious and\\n         unhealthy cross streets which are culs de sac, shut up at one\\n         end.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_197\\\">            There have been frequently cases on the construction of\\n         statutes where the Courts have held “or” to mean “and,” taking\\n         the rest of the sentence in which the word “or” occurred, the object\\n         and intention being prohibition, and the two things prohibited\\n         being coupled by the word “or.” I think the prohibition in s.98\\n         relates to both the width and open ending of streets.

The transitional provision is by its very nature an enabling\\none and has to be interpreted as such. In the present case, it is\\nmade to take care of the period between 30-4-1982 and 24-9-\\n1984, i.e., between the date of the introduction of the Bill of the\\namending Act and the date of the commencement of the Act. Since\\nsome awards might have been made by the Collector and the\\nreference Court during the said interregnum, the legislature did\\nnot want to deprive the awardees concerned either of the newly\\nconferred benefit of <a href=\\\"/doc/31609/\\\" id=\\\"a_697\\\">Section 23</a>(1-A) or of the increased benefit\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/981477/\\\" id=\\\"a_698\\\">Sections 23(2)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1945807/\\\" id=\\\"a_699\\\">28</a>. The second object was to enable the\\nCollector and the Court to give the said benefits in the proceedings\\npending before them where they had not made awards. The only\\nlimitation that was placed on the power of the Collector in this\\nbehalf was that he should not reopen the awards already made\\nby him in proceedings which were pending before him on 30-4-\\n1982 to give the benefit of <a href=\\\"/doc/31609/\\\" id=\\\"a_700\\\">Section 23</a>(1-A) to such awardees. This\\nwas as stated earlier, for two reasons. If the said awards are\\npending before the reference Court on the date of the\\ncommencement of the amending Act, viz., 24-9-1984, the\\nreference Court would be able to give the said benefit to the\\nawardees. On the other hand, if the awardees in question had\\naccepted the awards, the same having become final, should not\\nbe reopened. As regards the increased benefit under <a href=\\\"/doc/981477/\\\" id=\\\"a_701\\\">Sections\\n23(2)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1945807/\\\" id=\\\"a_702\\\">28</a>, the intention of the legislature was to extend it not\\nonly to the proceedings pending before the reference Court on 24-\\n9-1984 but also to those where awards were made by the\\nCollector and the reference Courts between 30-4-1982 and 24-9-\\n1984. Hence these awards could not only be reopened but if they\\nwere the subject-matter of the appeal before High Courts or the\\nSupreme Court, the appellate orders could also be reopened to\\nextend the said benefits.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_225\\\">                                   ***\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_226\\\">71. <a href=\\\"/doc/2587/\\\" id=\\\"a_703\\\">Section 30</a> of the amending Act bears the heading\\n&quot;Transitional provisions.&quot; Explaining the role of transitional\\nprovisions in a statute, Bennion has stated:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_114\\\">“Where an Act contains substantive, amending or repealing\\nenactments, it commonly also includes transitional provisions\\nwhich regulate the coming into operation of those enactments and\\nmodify their effect during the period of transition.

Sub-section\\n             (2) of Section 85 provides for a non-obstante clause. Clause (a) of\\n             the said sub-section provides for saving clause stating that the\\n             provisions of the said enactments shall apply in relation to\\n             arbitral proceedings which commenced before the said Act came\\n             into force. Thus, those arbitral proceedings which were\\n             commenced before coming into force of the 1996 Act are saved\\n             and the provisions of the 1996 Act would apply in relation to\\n             arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the said Act\\n             came into force. Even for the said limited purpose, it is necessary\\n             to find out as to what is meant by commencement of arbitral\\n             proceedings for the purpose of the 1996 Act wherefor also\\n             necessity of reference to <a href=\\\"/doc/1992048/\\\" id=\\\"a_708\\\">Section 21</a> would arise. The court is to\\n             interpret the repeal and savings clauses in such a manner so as\\n             to give a pragmatic and purposive meaning thereto. It is one thing\\n             to say that commencement of arbitration proceedings is\\n             dependent upon the facts of each case as that would be subject\\n             to the agreement between the parties. It is also another thing to\\n             say that the expression “commencement of arbitration\\n             proceedings” must be understood having regard to the context in\\n             which the same is used; but it would be a totally different thing\\n             to say that the arbitration proceedings commence only for the\\n             purpose of limitation upon issuance of a notice and for no other\\n             purpose. The statute does not say so. Even the case-laws do not\\n             suggest the same.

It is seen that after\\n             the notification in GOR 1392 dated 17-10-1962 was published,\\n             the acquisition proceeding had become final, the compensation\\n             was paid to the appellants’ father and thereafter the lands stood\\n             vested in the State. In terms of the agreement as contemplated in\\n             <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_729\\\">Chapter VII of the Act</a>, the Company had delivered possession\\n             subject to the terms and conditions thereunder.

In\\n             furtherance thereof, the lands came to be surrendered to the\\n             Government for resumption.

Therefore, the public purpose\\n             for which acquisition was made was substituted for another\\n             public purpose. Moreover, the question stood finally settled 32\\n             years ago and hence the writ petition cannot be entertained after\\n             three decades on the ground that either original purpose was not\\n             public purpose or the land cannot be used for any other purpose.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_126\\\">             <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1199248\\\" id=\\\"span_273\\\">6.

Since the Act of 1894 never provide for the lapse in case the\\n\\ncompensation amount was not deposited, non-deposit carried higher\\n\\ninterest. The provisions under the new Act are identical: there is no\\n\\nlapse of any acquisition proceeding by non-compliance with Section 77.\\n\\nInterpreting &quot;or&quot; under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_762\\\">Section 24(2)</a> of the Act of 2013 disjunctively,\\n\\nwould result in an anomalous situation - because, once compensation\\n\\nhas been paid to the landowner, there is no provision for its refund. It\\n\\nwas fairly conceded on behalf of the landowners that they must return\\n\\nthe compensation in the case of lapse if possession has not been taken.\\n\\nIn case possession is with the landowner and compensation has been\\n\\npaid, according to landowners’ submission, there is deemed lapse under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_763\\\">Section 24(2)</a> by reading the word “or” disjunctively. It would then be\\n\\nopen to the State Government to withdraw the money deposited in the\\n\\nReference Court.

In our opinion, the submissions cannot be accepted as an\\n\\nanomalous result would occur. In case physical possession is with the\\n\\nlandowner; and compensation has been paid, there is no provision in the\\n\\nAct for disgorging out the benefit of compensation. In the absence of any\\n\\nprovision for refund in the Act of 2013, the State cannot recover\\n\\ncompensation paid. The landowner would be unjustly enriched. This\\n\\ncould never have been the legislative intent of enacting <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_764\\\">Section 24(2)</a> of\\n\\nthe Act of 2013. The principle of restitution, unless provided in the Act,\\n\\ncannot be resorted to by the authorities on their own. The absence of\\n\\nprovision for refund in the Act of 2013 reinforces our conclusion that\\n\\nthe word &quot;or&quot; has to be read as conjunctively and has to be read as\\n\\n&quot;and.&quot; The landowners’ argument about the State’s ability to recover\\n\\nsuch amounts, in the absence of any provision, by relying on the\\n\\nprinciple of restitution, is without merit, because firstly such principle\\n\\nis without any legal sanction. The State would have to resort to the\\n\\nremedy of a suit, which can potentially result in litigation of enormous\\n\\nproportions; besides, the landowners can well argue that the property\\n\\n(i.e. the amounts) legally belonged to them and that the limitation for\\n\\nclaiming it back would have expired. Several other potential defences\\n\\nwould be available, each of which would result in multifarious litigation.\\n\\nTherefore, the contention is ex-facie untenable and insubstantial.\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_292\\\">\\f                                    125</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_240\\\">133.

It is clear that vesting under <a href=\\\"/doc/562722/\\\" id=\\\"a_765\\\">Section 16</a> of the Act of 1894 does not\\n\\ndepend upon payment of compensation.

A further controversy can then\\n             be raised by the landlords that what was paid was not 80% and\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_247\\\">98   (2009) 10 SCC 689\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_301\\\">\\f                                         129</span>\\n\\n         was short of 80% and therefore, the acquisition should be set at\\n         naught. Such extreme interpretation cannot be afforded because\\n         indeed under <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_802\\\">Section 17</a> itself, the basic idea of avoiding the\\n         enquiry under Section 5-A is in view of the urgent need on the\\n         part of the State Government for the land to be acquired for any\\n         eventuality discovered by either sub-section (1) or sub-section (2)\\n         of <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_803\\\">Section 17</a> of the Act.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_248\\\">         93.

A clear-cut observation came to be made in that\\n         behalf in para 12, to the effect that the non-compliance with\\n         <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_810\\\">Section 17</a> of the Act, insofar as, payment of compensation is\\n         concerned, did not result in lapsing of the land acquisition\\n         proceedings.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1653863\\\" id=\\\"span_303\\\">The law <a href=\\\"/doc/1883818/\\\" id=\\\"a_811\\\">laid down by</a> this Court in <a href=\\\"/doc/1653863/\\\" id=\\\"a_812\\\">Satendra Prasad\\n         Jain v.

Such a setting aside or quashing\\nwas inevitable because the acquisition proceedings had been\\ncompleted under <a href=\\\"/doc/1797812/\\\" id=\\\"a_847\\\">Section 17</a> and the land had vested in the State\\nGovernment, inasmuch as, without setting aside that vesting of\\nthe land in the State Government and restoring the land to the\\nappellant-owners, that land was unavailable for subsequent\\nacquisition by following the procedure under Section 5-A, <a href=\\\"/doc/1792838/\\\" id=\\\"a_848\\\">Section\\n6</a>, <a href=\\\"/doc/291273/\\\" id=\\\"a_849\\\">Section 11</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/562722/\\\" id=\\\"a_850\\\">Section 16</a>.

Thereby, no one has nor claimed any right, title\\n             and interest in respect of the acquired land.

In that event, land is required to\\n             be surrendered to the erstwhile owners. That is not the case on\\n             the facts of this case. Under these circumstances, the Government\\n             having become the absolute owner of the property free from all\\n             encumbrances, unless the title is conferred on any person in\\n             accordance with a procedure known to law, no one can claim any\\n             title much less equitable title by remaining in possession.

For example, <a href=\\\"/doc/1692907/\\\" id=\\\"a_890\\\">S. 56</a> of the\\n             Provincial Insolvency Act (5 of 1920) empowers the Court at the\\n             time of the making of the order of adjudication or thereafter to\\n             appoint a receiver for the property of the insolvent and further\\n             provides that “such property shall thereupon vest in such\\n             receiver”. The property vests in the receiver for the purpose of\\n             administering the estate of the insolvent for the payment of his\\n             debts after realising his assets. The property of the insolvent\\n             vests in the receiver not for all purposes but only for the purpose\\n             of the <a href=\\\"/doc/393016/\\\" id=\\\"a_891\\\">Insolvency Act</a> and the receiver has no interest of his own\\n             in the property. On the other hand, Ss. 16 and 17 of the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_892\\\">Land\\n             Acquisition Act</a> (Act 1 of LA), provide that the property so acquired,\\n             upon the happening of certain events, shall “vest absolutely in\\n             the Government free from all encumbrances”. In the cases\\n             contemplated by Ss. 16 and 17 the property acquired becomes\\n             the property of Government without any conditions or limitations\\n             either as to title or possession. The legislature has made it clear\\n             that the vesting of the property is not for any limited purpose or\\n             limited duration. It would thus appear that the word “vest” has\\n             not got a fixed connotation meaning in all cases that the property\\n             is owned by the person or the authority in whom it vests. It may\\n             vest in title, or it may vest in possession, or it may vest in a limited\\n             sense, as indicated in the context in which it may have been used\\n             in a particular piece of legislation. The provisions of the\\n             Improvement Act, particularly Ss. 45 to 49 and 54 and 54-A when\\n             they speak of a certain building or street or square or other land\\n             vesting in a municipality or other local body or in a trust, do not\\n             necessarily mean that ownership has passed to any of them.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n108   (1996) 1 SCC 311\\n109   (1996) 3 SCC 99\\n110   1957 SCR 01\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_339\\\">\\f                                             138</span>\\n\\nIn re: Vested rights under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_893\\\">Section 24</a> of the Act of 2013\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_269\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"132996988\\\" id=\\\"span_340\\\">148.

When\\n             we make a comprehensive reference to the above principles, it\\n             can be said that for the legal pursuit of a remedy it must be shown\\n             that the various stages of such remedy are formed into a chain or\\n             rather as series of it, which are connected by an intrinsic unity\\n             which can be called as one proceeding, that such vested right, if\\n             any, should have its origin in a proceeding which was instituted\\n             on such right having been crystallised at the time of its origin\\n             itself, in which event all future claims on that basis to be pursued\\n             would get preserved till the said right is to be ultimately\\n             examined. In the event of such preservation of the future remedy\\n             having come into existence and got crystallised, that would date\\n             back to the date of origin when the so-called vested right\\n             commenced, that then and then only it can be held that the said\\n             right became a vested right and it is not defeated by the law that\\n             prevails at the date of its decision or at the date of subsequent\\n             filing of the claim. One other fundamental principle laid down\\n             which is to be borne in mind, is that even such a vested right can\\n             also be taken away by a subsequent enactment if such\\n             subsequent enactment specifically provides by express words or\\n             by necessary intendment.

The French Civil Code provides that “La loi\\n        ne dipose que pour l’avenir; elle n’a point d’effet retroactif:”\\n                                        …..\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_280\\\">        But both these passages draw attention to an important point,\\n        that the exception only applies where application of it would not\\n        cause unfairness or injustice. This is consistent with the general\\n        rule or presumption which is itself based on considerations of\\n        fairness and justice, as shown by the passage in Maxwell quoted,\\n        ante, p. 494C-E, and recently emphasised by Staughton LJ in\\n        Secretary of State for Social Security v.

It is not simply a\\n        question of classifying an enactment as retrospective or not\\n        retrospective. Rather it may well be a matter of degree – the\\n        greater the unfairness, the more it is to be expected that\\n        Parliament will make it clear if that is intended.”\\n\\n        The distinction between rights and procedure, and unfairness\\n        and fairness, may well overlap. Thus, if a limitation period is\\n        shortened but a plaintiff has time to sue before expiry of the\\n        shortened period, he is likely to be statute-barred if he does not\\n        sue within the shortened period (see The Ydun [1899] P. 236.);\\n        but if a limitation period is extended after a previous shorter\\n        limitation period has already expired, the plaintiff will be unable\\n        to take advantage of the new period because an absolute defence\\n        has by then accrued to the defendant and it would not be fair to\\n        deprive him of it: See Yew Bon Tew v.

That would reverse the true\\npresumption. A necessary and distinct implication typically\\narises in the context of a statute that, by repealing a previous\\nstatute, would leave a “lacuna” in the law if the new statute were\\nnot to be construed as having retrospective effect: see, e.g., <a href=\\\"/doc/1541674/\\\" id=\\\"a_908\\\">Food\\nCorporation of India v.

The particular problem in the present case is a\\ntransitional problem only, applicable only to those arbitrators that\\nare stale as at 1 January 1992, in respect of which applications\\nto strike out are made shortly thereafter. In the future, such\\nclaimants will either continue to be dilatory or not, in which case\\nthe references will proceed to a conclusion.

So far as claimants in existing arbitrations are\\nconcerned, they may well have been (correctly) advised prior to 1\\nJanuary 1992 that they could proceed slowly with the claim\\nwithout risk of having their claims dismissed by reason of such\\ndelay.

That the section was retrospective in effect was not\\n             disputed by Sir Robert Finlay, but he argued that the\\n             retrospective operation is limited by the language of the section\\n             and does not extend to a charge made in respect of profits derived\\n             from foreign possessions or securities under s.108 of the Income\\n             Tax Act, 1842. In support of this argument he relied upon the\\n             express reference in the first sub-section of<a href=\\\"/doc/1936195/\\\" id=\\\"a_912\\\"> s.32</a> to s.106, and\\n             s.146 of the Income Tax Act, 1842, upon the omission of any\\n             reference in this sub-section to s.108, and upon the repeal in sub-\\n             s.2 of<a href=\\\"/doc/1936195/\\\" id=\\\"a_913\\\"> s.32</a> of s.108.

This is because once possession\\n\\nis been taken, there can be no lapse of the proceedings, and higher\\n\\ncompensation is intended on failure to deposit the compensation. Once\\n\\nan award has been passed and possession has been taken, there is\\n\\nabsolute vesting of the land, as such higher compensation follows under\\n\\nthe proviso, which is beneficial to holders. In a case where both the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_400\\\">\\f                                     159</span>\\n\\nnegative conditions have not been fulfilled, as mentioned in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_994\\\">section\\n\\n24(2)</a>, there is a lapse.

The only exception carved out is the period of 5\\n\\nyears or more and that too by providing a non-obstante clause in\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_999\\\">Section 24(2)</a> to anything contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1000\\\">section 24(1)</a>. The non-obstante\\n\\nclause qualifies the proviso also to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1001\\\">Section 24(2)</a>. It has to be read as\\n\\npart of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1002\\\">Section 24(2)</a> as it is an exception to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1003\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a>. In our\\n\\nopinion, <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1004\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a> is a self-contained provision, and is also a part\\n\\nof the non-obstante clause to the other provisions of the Act as provided\\n\\nin sub-section (1). Parliament worked out an exception, by providing a\\n\\nnon-obstante clause in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1005\\\">section 24(2)</a>, to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1006\\\">Section 24(1)</a>.

Any other interpretation will be derogatory\\n\\nto the provisions contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1011\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a> which provides that the\\n\\npending proceedings shall continue under the Act of 1894 as if it had\\n\\nnot been repealed, that would include the part relating to compensation\\n\\ntoo. Even if there is no lapse of proceedings under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1012\\\">section 24(1)(a)</a>, only\\n\\nhigher compensation follows under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1013\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a>. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1014\\\">Section 24(2)</a> deals\\n\\nwith      the   award having   been made     five   years or   before   the\\n\\ncommencement of the new Act. The legislative history also indicates/it\\n\\nwas intended that five years&#x27; period should be adequate to make\\n\\npayment of compensation and to take possession. In that spirit, the\\n\\nproviso has been carved out as part of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1015\\\">section 24(2)</a>. Thus when\\n\\nParliament has placed it at a particular place, by a process of reasoning,\\n\\nthere can be no lifting and relocation of the provision. To bodily lift it\\n\\nwould be an impermissible exercise. Unless it produces absurd results\\n\\nand does not fit in the scheme of the Act and the provisions to which it\\n\\nis attached such an interpretation, doing violence to the express\\n\\nprovision, is not a legitimate interpretative exercise. There is no need to\\n\\nadd it as the proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1016\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a> as it has not been done by the\\n\\nlegislature, and it makes sense where it has been placed.

Parliament has used the full stop (.) after <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1018\\\">section 24(1)</a> and colon\\n\\n(:) after <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1019\\\">section 24(2)</a>. It cannot be gainsaid that punctuation plays a\\n\\nvital role, particularly when an attempt is made to relocate any part of\\n\\nthe provision. The use of the colon is to introduce a sub-clause that\\n\\nfollows logically from the text before it. We are examining this aspect of\\n\\nthe colon, additionally. Though as the interpretation of the provision of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1020\\\">Section 24(2)</a> and its proviso needs no further deliberation regarding its\\n\\nplacement, the same is to be read as a proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1021\\\">Section 24(2)</a> and not\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1022\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a>. Use of punctuation colon reinforces our conclusion and\\n\\npunctuation mark has been an accepted method of statutory\\n\\ninterpretation when such a problem arises. Though sometimes\\n\\npunctuation can be ignored also but not generally. The full stop after\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1023\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a> expresses deliberate intent to end a particular sentence\\n\\nand detach it from the next part. With regard to the meaning of the\\n\\npunctuation colon, the University of Oxford Style Guide states as under:\\n\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_192\\\">         “Use a colon to introduce a subclause which follows\\n         logically from the text before it, is not a new concept and\\n         depends logically on the preceding main clause.

It is clear that the colon (:) has a reference to the previous\\n\\nstatement and enlarges the same and extends the meaning of the\\n\\nsentence. The colon indicates that the text is intrinsically linked to the\\n\\nprevious provision preceding it, i.e., <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1024\\\">Section 24(2)</a> in this case and not\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1025\\\">section 24(1)</a>.

Certain\\n\\ndecisions have been referred to saying that importance and weightage\\n\\nare to be given to punctuation marks.

However, it was submitted\\n\\nthat in the past century, the English courts realised that the drafts\\n\\nplaced before the Parliament also carry punctuations and, thus, it is\\n\\nimportant to give meaning to the same. Bennion on Statutory\\n\\nInterpretation has this to say regarding punctuation marks:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_198\\\">          “16.8 Punctuation is a part of an Act and may be considered in\\n         construing a provision.

Its purpose is to denote the steps that\\n          ought to be made in oral reading and to point out the sense.

The use of that word unmistakably leads to the\\n        conclusion that the adjectival clause also qualifies something\\n        other than “other law”. If the intention were that the <a href=\\\"/doc/214169/\\\" id=\\\"a_1032\\\">Indian Bar\\n        Councils Act</a> should remain unaffected by the qualifying phrase\\n        and should be superseded in toto for the purposes of this Act the\\n        legislature would have said “or in any law regulating the\\n        conditions etc.” It would have been yet simpler not to refer to the\\n        <a href=\\\"/doc/214169/\\\" id=\\\"a_1033\\\">Indian Bar Councils Act</a> at all and to drop the adjectival clause\\n        and to simply say “Notwithstanding anything contained in any\\n        law”.

The expression “administration of justice” has\\n        been used without any qualification or limitation wide enough to\\n        include the “powers” and “jurisdiction” of all the courts except the\\n        Supreme Court.

When the window period has\\n\\nbeen provided under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1057\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a>, i.e., <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1058\\\">section 24(2)</a> and its proviso,\\n\\nhigher compensation cannot follow in case of an award which has been\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_426\\\">\\f                                  170</span>\\n\\npassed within 5 years of the enactment of the Act of 2013 otherwise\\n\\nanomalous results shall accrue. In case proviso is read as a part of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1059\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a>, it would be repugnant to the consideration of the\\n\\nprovision which has been carved out saving acquisition and providing\\n\\nwindow period of 5 years to complete the acquisition proceedings. There\\n\\nwere cases under the Act of 1894, in which award may have been made\\n\\nin December 2013, a few days before the Act was enforced on 1.1.2014.\\n\\nAs the provisions of the Act of 1894 are applicable to such awards,\\n\\nobviously notice of the award has to be given under <a href=\\\"/doc/948147/\\\" id=\\\"a_1060\\\">Section 12</a> of the\\n\\nsaid Act. There is no question of outright deposit. In such event as the\\n\\ndeposit is to be made when the Collector is prevented by the exigencies\\n\\nspecified in <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_1061\\\">Section 31(2)</a> from making payment. The deposit is not\\n\\ncontemplated directly either in the court or the treasury, as the case\\n\\nmay be as provided in <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_1062\\\">section 31(2)</a>, corresponding to <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_1063\\\">section 77(2)</a> of\\n\\nthe Act of 2013.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_329\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_330\\\">183. The proviso relates to the non-payment.          Compensation is\\n\\ndeposited when the Collector is prevented from making payment. It is\\n\\nthe obligation made under <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_1064\\\">section 31(1)</a> to tender the amount and pay\\n\\nunless prevented by the contingencies specified in <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_1065\\\">section 31(2)</a>. Thus,\\n\\nthe deposit has a co-relation with the expression &quot;payment has not been\\n\\nmade,&quot; and the proviso makes sense with <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1066\\\">Section 24 (2)</a> only. In case of\\n\\nnon-payment or prevention from payment, compensation is required to\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_427\\\">\\f                                   171</span>\\n\\nbe deposited as the case may be in the Reference Court or otherwise in\\n\\nTreasury, if permissible.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_331\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_332\\\">184. The proviso uses the expression that the amount is to be deposited\\n\\nin the account of beneficiaries. Earlier under the Act of 1894, there was\\n\\nno such provision for depositing the amount in the bank account of\\n\\nbeneficiaries but the method which was used as per the forms which\\n\\nwere prescribed to deposit the amount, it was credited to the Reference\\n\\nCourt or in the Treasury in the names of the beneficiaries and as against\\n\\nthe award.    It was not a separate account but an account of the\\n\\nReference Court or set apart in the treasury. The proviso has to be\\n\\ninterpreted and given the meaning with <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1067\\\">Section 24(2)</a> as an amount was\\n\\nrequired to be paid and on being prevented had to be deposited as\\n\\nenvisaged under the Act of 1894.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_333\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_334\\\">185. If we hold that even if the award has been passed within 5 years\\n\\nand the compensation amount has not been deposited with respect to\\n\\nsuch an award passed in the window period, higher compensation to\\n\\nfollow if it is not deposited with respect to the majority of the holdings\\n\\nwould amount to re-writing the statute. The provision of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1068\\\">section 24(1)(a)</a>\\n\\nis clear if an award has not been passed, higher compensation to follow.\\n\\nNo lapse is provided. In case award has been passed within the window\\n\\nperiod of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1069\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a>, inter alia, the provisions for compensation\\n\\nwould be that of the Act of 1894. The only exception to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1070\\\">section 24(1)</a> is\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_428\\\">\\f                                    172</span>\\n\\ncreated by the non-obstante clause in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1071\\\">section 24(2)</a> by providing that in\\n\\ncase the requisite steps have not been taken for 5 years or more, then\\n\\nthere is lapse as a negative condition. The proviso contemplates higher\\n\\ncompensation, in case compensation has not been paid, and the\\n\\namount has not been deposited with respect to the majority of the\\n\\nholdings, to all the beneficiaries under the Act of 2013, who were\\n\\nholding land on the date of notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/43654/\\\" id=\\\"a_1072\\\">Section 4</a>. If the proviso\\n\\nis added, <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1073\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a> will destroy the very provision of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1074\\\">section\\n\\n24(1)(b)</a> providing proceedings to continue under the Act of 1894, which\\n\\nis not the function of the proviso to substitute the main Section but to\\n\\nexplain it. It is not to cause repugnancy with the main provision. The\\n\\nfunction of the proviso is to explain or widen the scope. It is a settled\\n\\nproposition of law that the proviso cannot travel beyond the provision\\n\\nto which it is attached. The proviso would travel beyond the Act of 1894\\n\\nas it is the intention of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1075\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a> the proceedings to govern by the\\n\\nAct of 1894. Thus, the proviso has no space to exist with <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1076\\\">section\\n\\n24(1)(b)</a>, and it has rightly not been attached by Parliament, with\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1077\\\">Section 24(2)</a> and has been placed at the right place where it should\\n\\nhave been.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_335\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_336\\\">186. It is in the cases where there is no lapse under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1078\\\">section 24(2)</a> if\\n\\neither step has been taken proviso operates to provide higher\\n\\ncompensation. In the cases where possession has been taken, but the\\n\\namount has not been deposited as required under the proviso, higher\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_429\\\">\\f                                    173</span>\\n\\ncompensation to all the beneficiaries has to follow as once possession\\n\\nhas been taken, the land is vested in the State and payment is necessary\\n\\nfor any acquisition. As such, Parliament has provided in such cases\\n\\nhigher compensation to follow as envisaged in the proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1079\\\">section\\n\\n24(2)</a>. Lapse of acquisition is provided only in the exigencies where\\n\\npossession has not been taken, nor compensation has been paid in the\\n\\nproceedings for acquisition pending as on the date on which the Act of\\n\\n2013 came into force, then the State Government has to initiate fresh\\n\\nproceedings if it so desires. The proviso is part of the scheme of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1080\\\">section\\n\\n24(2)</a>, and the entire provision of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1081\\\">section 24(2)</a>, including the proviso,\\n\\noperates when inaction is there for a period of 5 years or more, as\\n\\ncontemplated therein.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_337\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_338\\\">187. The fundamental consideration is that the proviso cannot\\n\\nsupersede the main provision of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1082\\\">section 24(1)(b)</a> and destroy it. The\\n\\nfunction of the proviso is to except out the pressing provisions to which\\n\\nit is attached. In case possession has been taken, but only a few\\n\\nbeneficiaries have been paid, there is no lapse. Even if nobody has been\\n\\npaid, there is no lapse once possession has been taken. In case\\n\\ncompensation has not been deposited with respect to the majority of the\\n\\nholdings, there is no lapse, but higher compensation to all the\\n\\nbeneficiaries has to follow. The provision provides equal treatment to\\n\\nall, not only to a few- and, in effect, is similar to <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_1083\\\">Section 28A</a> of the Act\\n\\nof 1894- in case the obligation to pay or deposit has not been discharged\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_430\\\">\\f                                  174</span>\\n\\nand there is no arrangement of money to discharge the obligation either\\n\\nby paying or depositing in the Reference Court and, if permissible, in\\n\\nthe treasury. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1084\\\">Section 24(2)</a> saves land which has been vested in the\\n\\nState, once award has been passed and possession of land. However, in\\n\\ncase compensation has not been deposited with respect to majority of\\n\\nlandowners, in any given award, all beneficiaries have to be paid higher\\n\\ncompensation under the new Act.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_339\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_340\\\">188. It was urged that <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1085\\\">section 24(1)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1086\\\">24(2)</a> deal with different\\n\\nsubjects.

We are\\n\\nunable to accept the submission. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1089\\\">Section 24(2)</a> also deals with payment\\n\\nof compensation and taking of possession. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1090\\\">Section 24(1)(a)</a> is\\n\\nconcerning a situation where no award has been made, higher\\n\\ncompensation under the new Act to follow.

Thus, the\\n\\nmain part of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1093\\\">section 24(2)</a> deals with payment of compensation; also the\\n\\nproviso which provides for higher compensation to be paid to all is in\\n\\nthe context of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1094\\\">section 24(2)</a> and cannot be lifted and added to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1095\\\">Section\\n\\n24(1)(b)</a> in the aforesaid circumstances.

If one of the steps has been\\n\\ntaken, then the proviso can operate. Time is the essence. It is on the\\n\\nbasis of time-lag that the lapse is provided and in default of payment\\n\\nfor five years as provided on failure to deposit higher compensation is\\n\\nto be paid. It is based on that time-lag higher compensation has to\\n\\nfollow. It is not the mere use of colon under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1099\\\">section 24(2)</a> but the\\n\\nplacement of the proviso next to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1100\\\">Section 24 (2)</a> and not below <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1101\\\">Section\\n\\n24(1)(b)</a>.

A very apt description and extent of a proviso was given by\\nLord Loreburn in Rhondda Urban District Council v. Taff Vale\\nRailway Co., 1909 AC 253, where it was pointed out that\\ninsertion of a proviso by the draftsman is not always strictly\\nadhered to its legitimate use and at times a section worded as a\\nproviso may wholly or partly be in substance a fresh enactment\\nadding to and not merely excepting something out of or qualifying\\nwhat goes before. To the same effect is a later decision of the\\nsame Court in Jennings v. Kelly, 1940 AC 206, where it was\\nobserved thus:\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_223\\\">   “We must now come to the proviso, for there is, I think, no doubt\\nthat, in the construction of the section, the whole of it must be\\nread, and a consistent meaning, if possible, given to every part of\\nit. The words are:... ‘provided that such licence shall be granted\\nonly for premises situate in the ward or district electoral division\\nin which such increase in population has taken place...’ There\\nseems to be no doubt that the words “such increase in\\npopulation” refer to the increase of not less than 25 per cent of\\nthe population mentioned in the opening words of the section.”\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_358\\\">36.

In short, generally speaking, a proviso is intended to limit the\\nenacted provision so as to except something which would have\\notherwise been within it or in some measure to modify the\\nenacting clause.

As a general rule, a proviso is added to an enactment\\n           to qualify or create an exception to what is in the enactment, and\\n           ordinarily, a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general rule.\\n           But, provisos are often added not as exceptions or qualifications\\n           to the main enactment but as savings clauses, in which cases\\n           they will not be construed as controlled by the section. The\\n           proviso which has been added to <a href=\\\"/doc/703570/\\\" id=\\\"a_1112\\\">Section 50</a> of the Act deals with\\n           the effect of repeal.

For it provides “further” that “in any case where there is\\n           no physical delivery of the goods,” the tax is to be payable when\\n           the property in the goods passes to the purchaser. Thus where\\n           there is no physical delivery the notional delivery which proviso\\n           1 introduces is rendered inapplicable.

There has been no physical\\n         delivery of the goods by the Dominion Company to the Pulp\\n         Company. The proviso enacts that “in any case” where there has\\n         been no physical delivery the tax is to be payable when the\\n         property passes. The property in the goods in question has never\\n         passed to the Pulp Company. Consequently the tax has nevern\\n         become payable. If proviso 2 is repugnant in any way to proviso\\n         1 it must prevail for it stands last in the enactment and so to quote\\n         Lord Tenterden C.J., “speaks the last intention of the maker”\\n         ((1831), 2 B. &amp; Ad. 818 at p.821).

The proviso thus, is not foreign to compensation to be paid under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1123\\\">section 24(2)</a>. It provides what is dealt with in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1124\\\">Section 24(2)</a> and takes\\n\\nto its logical conclusion, and provides for higher compensation, where\\n\\nthere is and can be no lapsing of acquisition proceedings. The rule of\\n\\nconstruction- as is clear from the preceding case law discussed, is that\\n\\nthe proviso should be limited in its operation to the subject-matter in a\\n\\nclause. A proviso is ordinarily a proviso and has to be harmoniously\\n\\nconstrued with the provisions. In our opinion, the proviso is capable of\\n\\nbeing harmoniously construed with <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1125\\\">Section 24(2)</a> and not with <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1126\\\">section\\n\\n24(1)(b)</a>, once we interpret the word &#x27;or&#x27; as &#x27;nor&#x27; in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1127\\\">section 24(2)</a>.\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_367\\\">196.

Thus, the word &#x27;paid&#x27; used in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1156\\\">section 24(2)</a> cannot\\n\\nbe said to include within its ken &#x27;deposit&#x27; under <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_1157\\\">section 31(2)</a>.

The word “paid” in <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_1165\\\">Section 31(1)</a> to the landowner cannot include\\n\\nin its ambit the expression &quot;deposited&quot; in court.

However, in case there is a tender of the amount that is to\\n\\nmean amount is made available to the landowner that would be a\\n\\ndischarge of the obligation to make the payment and in that event such\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_460\\\">\\f                                   187</span>\\n\\na person cannot be penalised for the default in making the payment.

The default will not have the effect of reopening the concluded\\n\\nproceedings. The legal position and consequence which prevailed from\\n\\n1893 till 2013 on failure to deposit was only the liability for interest and\\n\\nall those transactions were never sought to be invalidated by the\\n\\nprovisions contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1182\\\">Section 24</a>. It is only in the case where in a\\n\\npending proceeding for a period of five years or more, the steps have not\\n\\nbeen taken for taking possession and for payment of compensation,\\n\\nthen there is a lapse under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1183\\\">section 24(2)</a>. In case amount has not been\\n\\ndeposited   with    respect   to   majority   of   land   holdings,   higher\\n\\ncompensation has to follow.

It was submitted that mere tender of amount is not payment. The\\n\\namount has to be actually paid.

Landowners\\n\\ncannot be forced to receive it. In case a person has not accepted the\\n\\namount wants to take the advantage of non-payment, though the\\n\\namount has remained due to his own act. It is not open to him to\\n\\ncontend that amount has not been paid to him, as such, there should\\n\\nbe lapse of the proceedings. Even in a case when offer for payment has\\n\\nbeen made but not deposited, liability to pay amount along with interest\\n\\nsubsist and if not deposited for majority of holding, for that adequate\\n\\nprovisions have been given in the proviso also to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1184\\\">Section 24(2)</a>. The\\n\\nscheme of the Act of 2013 in Sections 77 and 80 is also the same as\\n\\nthat provided in <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_1185\\\">Sections 31</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_1186\\\">34</a> of the Act of 1894.\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_382\\\">207. It was urged that landowners can seek investment in an interest\\n\\nbearing account, there is no doubt about that investment can be sought\\n\\nfrom the court under <a href=\\\"/doc/1936195/\\\" id=\\\"a_1187\\\">Sections 32</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1362441/\\\" id=\\\"a_1188\\\">33</a> of Act of 1894, but interest in\\n\\nGovernment securities is not more than what is provided in <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_1189\\\">section 34</a>\\n\\nat the rate of 9 percent from the date of taking possession for one year\\n\\nand thereafter, at the rate of 15 percent. We take judicial notice of the\\n\\nfact in no other Government security rate of interest is higher on the\\n\\namount being invested under <a href=\\\"/doc/1936195/\\\" id=\\\"a_1190\\\">sections 32</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1362441/\\\" id=\\\"a_1191\\\">33</a> of the Act of 1894.\\n\\nHigher rate of interest is available under <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_1192\\\">section 34</a> to the advantage of\\n\\nlandowners. It was submitted that in case the amount is deposited in\\n\\nthe court, it is on behalf of the beneficiary. The submission overlooks\\n\\nthe form in which it used to be deposited in the treasury too, that\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_463\\\">\\f                                   190</span>\\n\\namount is also credited in the treasury payable to the beneficiary\\n\\nspecified in his name with land details, date of award, etc.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_383\\\">208. There is another reason why this court holds that such an\\n\\ninterpretation is reasonable and in tune with Parliamentary intent.\\n\\nUnder the old regime, it was open to the Collector to fix a convenient\\n\\ndate or dates for announcement of award, and tender payment. In the\\n\\nevent of refusal by the landowner to receive, or in other cases, such as\\n\\nabsence of the true owner, or in case of dispute as to who was to receive\\n\\nit, no doubt, the statute provided that the amount was to be deposited\\n\\nwith the court: as it does today, under Section 77. Yet, neither during\\n\\nthe time when the Act of 1894 was in operation, nor under the Act of\\n\\n2013, the entire acquisition does not lapse for non-deposit of the\\n\\ncompensation amount in court. This is a significant aspect which none\\n\\nof the previous decisions have noticed. Thus, it would be incorrect to\\n\\nimply that failure to deposit compensation [in court, under <a href=\\\"/doc/1718550/\\\" id=\\\"a_1193\\\">Section 31\\n\\n(2)</a>] would entail lapse, if the amounts have not been paid for five years\\n\\nor more prior to the coming into force of the Act of 2013. Such an\\n\\ninterpretation would lead to retrospective operation, of a provision, and\\n\\nthe nullification of acquisition proceedings, long completed, by\\n\\nimposition of a norm or standard, and its application for a time when it\\n\\ndid not exist.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_384\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_385\\\">209.

This Court has held that the\\n\\nemployer has tendered the wages and that would amount for payment,\\n\\notherwise a workman can make the provision unworkable by refusing\\n\\nto take the wages. This Court has observed thus:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_236\\\">              “(8) Let us now turn to the words of the proviso in the background\\n              of what we have said above. The proviso lays down that no\\n              workman shall be discharged or dismissed unless he has been\\n              paid wages for one month and an application has been made by\\n              the employer to the authority before which the proceeding is\\n              pending for approval of the action taken by the employer. It will\\n              be clear that two kinds of punishment are subject to the\\n              conditions of the proviso, namely, discharge or dismissal. Any\\n              other kind of punishment is not within the proviso. Further\\n              the proviso lays down two conditions, namely, (i) payment of\\n              wages for one month and (ii) making of an application by the\\n              employer to the authority before which the proceeding is pending\\n              for approval of the action taken. It is not disputed before us that\\n              when the proviso lays down the conditions as to payment of one\\n              month&#x27;s wages, all that the employer is required to do in order to\\n              carry out that condition is to tender the wages to the employee.\\n              But if the employee chooses not to accept the wages he cannot\\n              come forward and say that there has been no payment of wages\\n              to him by the employer. Therefore, though<a href=\\\"/doc/1362441/\\\" id=\\\"a_1198\\\"> S. 33</a> speaks of\\n              payment of one month&#x27;s wages it can only mean that the\\n              employer has tendered the wages and that would amount to\\n              payment, for otherwise a workman could always make the\\n              section unworkable by refusing to take the wages. So far as the\\n              second condition about the making of the application is\\n              concerned, the proviso requires that the application should be\\n              made for approval of the action taken by the employer.”\\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_391\\\">213. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1361980\\\" id=\\\"span_467\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/1361980/\\\" id=\\\"a_1199\\\">The Management of Delhi Transport Undertaking v.

In Principles of Statutory Interpretation\\n\\n(14th Edition) by Justice G.P. Singh, plethora of decisions have been\\n\\nreferred.

Payment is actually made to the landowner and deposit is\\n\\nmade in the court, that is not the payment made to the landowner. It\\n\\nmay be discharge of liability of payment of interest and not more than\\n\\nthat. Applying the rule of literal construction also natural, ordinary and\\n\\npopular meaning of the words “paid” and “deposited” do not carry the\\n\\nsame meaning; the natural and grammatical meaning has to be given\\n\\nto them, as observed in Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice\\n\\nG.P. Singh (at page 91) thus:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_239\\\">          “… Natural and grammatical meaning. The words of a statute\\n         are first understood in their natural, ordinary or popular sense\\n         and phrases and sentences are construed according to their\\n         grammatical meaning, unless that leads to some absurdity or\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_474\\\">\\f                                        195</span>\\n\\n         unless there is something in the context, or in the object of the\\n         statute to suggest the contrary.&quot; &quot;The true way&quot;, according\\n         to LORD BROUGHAM is, &quot;to take the words as the Legislature\\n         have given them, and to take the meaning which the words given\\n         naturally imply, unless where the construction of those Words is,\\n         either by the preamble or by the context of the words in question,\\n         controlled or alter &quot;; and in the words of VISCOUNT HALDANE,\\n         L.C., if the language used &quot;has a natural meaning we cannot\\n         depart from that meaning unless reading the statute as a whole,\\n         the context directs us to do so. In an oft-quoted passage, LORD\\n         WENSLEYDALE stated the Rule thus: &quot;In construing wills and\\n         indeed statutes and all written instruments, the grammatical and\\n         ordinary sense of the word is adhered to, unless that would lead\\n         to some absurdity, or some repugnance or inconsistency with the\\n         rest of the instrument in which case the grammatical and\\n         ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that\\n         absurdity, and inconsistency, but no further&quot;. And stated LORD\\n         ATKINSON: &quot;In the construction of statutes, their words must be\\n         interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense unless there be\\n         something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which\\n         they occur or in the circumstances in which they are used, to\\n         show that they were used in a special sense different from their\\n         ordinary grammatical sense&quot;. 28 VISCOUNT SIMON, L.C., said:\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_240\\\">         &quot;The golden Rule is that the words of a statute must prima facie\\n         be given their ordinary meaning&quot;. Natural and ordinary meaning\\n         of words should not be departed from &quot;unless it can be shown\\n         that the legal context in which the words are used requires a\\n         different meaning&quot;. Such a meaning cannot be departed from by\\n         the judges &quot;in the light of their own views as to policy&quot; although\\n         they can &quot;adopt a purposive interpretation if they can find in the\\n         statute read as a whole or in material to which they are permitted\\n         by law to refer as aids to interpretation an expression of\\n         Parliament&#x27;s purpose or policy&quot;. For a modern statement of the\\n         rule, one may refer to the speech of LORD SIMON OF GLAISDALE\\n         in a case where he said: &quot;Parliament is prima facie to be credited\\n         with meaning what is said in an Act of Parliament. The drafting\\n         of statutes, so important to a people who hope to live under\\n         the Rule of law, will never be satisfactory unless courts seek\\n         whenever possible to apply &#x27;the golden rule&#x27; of construction, that\\n         is to read the statutory language, grammatically and\\n         terminologically, in the ordinary and primary sense which it\\n         bears in its context, without omission or addition. Of\\n         course, Parliament is to be credited with good sense; so that\\n         when such an approach produces injustice, absurdity,\\n         contradiction or stultification of statutory objective the language\\n         may be modified sufficiently to avoid such disadvantage, though\\n         no further&quot;. The Rules stated above have been quoted with\\n         approval by the Supreme Court.......”\\n                                                      (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_241\\\">216.

Where the\\n              meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous, it is\\n              not for the Judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse for\\n              failing to give effect to its plain meaning because they themselves\\n              consider that the consequences of doing so would be inexpedient,\\n              or even unjust or immoral. In controversial matters such as are\\n              involved in industrial relations, there is room for differences of\\n              opinion as to what is expedient, what is just and what is morally\\n              justifiable. Under our Constitution it is Parliament&#x27;s opinion on\\n              these matters that is paramount.&quot;\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_399\\\">                                                              (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n              In the same judgment, it is further observed: (WLR p. 157 F)\\n              “… But if this be the case it is for Parliament, not for the judiciary,\\n              to decide whether any changes should be made to the law as\\n              stated in the Acts….”\\n                                                                 (emphasis supplied)\\n                                                   ***\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_400\\\">              67.

We are also unable to accept that <a href=\\\"/doc/331372/\\\" id=\\\"a_1228\\\">Section 2(2)</a>\\n              would make Part I applicable even to arbitrations which take\\n              place outside India. In our opinion, a plain reading of <a href=\\\"/doc/331372/\\\" id=\\\"a_1229\\\">Section 2(2)</a>\\n              makes it clear that Part I is limited in its application to arbitrations\\n              which take place in India. We are in agreement with the\\n              submissions made by the learned counsel for the respondents,\\n              and the interveners in support of the respondents, that\\n              Parliament by limiting the applicability of Part I to arbitrations\\n              which take place in India has expressed a legislative declaration.\\n              It has clearly given recognition to the territorial principle.\\n              Necessarily therefore, it has enacted that <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_1230\\\">Part I of the Arbitration\\n              Act, 1996</a> applies to arbitrations having their place/seat in India.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_401\\\">                                                 ***\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_489\\\">147</span>\\n      (2012) 9 SCC 552\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_490\\\">\\f                                             199</span>\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_402\\\">              82. Another strong reason for rejecting the submission made by\\n              the learned counsel for the appellants is that if Part I were to be\\n              applicable to arbitrations seated in foreign countries, certain\\n              words would have to be added to <a href=\\\"/doc/331372/\\\" id=\\\"a_1231\\\">Section 2(2)</a>. The section would\\n              have to provide that “this part shall apply where the place of\\n              arbitration is in India and to arbitrations having its place out of\\n              India.” Apart from being contrary to the contextual intent and\\n              object of <a href=\\\"/doc/331372/\\\" id=\\\"a_1232\\\">Section 2(2)</a>, such an interpretation would amount to a\\n              drastic and unwarranted rewriting/alteration of the language of\\n              <a href=\\\"/doc/331372/\\\" id=\\\"a_1233\\\">Section 2(2)</a>.

We have to look to what actual prejudice has\\n             been caused to a person by the supposed denial to him of a\\n             particular right. Here the question was a simple one, viz. whether\\n             the measurement book prepared for the contract work had been\\n             properly scrutinised and checked by the appellant or not. He did\\n             the checking in March 1954 and immediately thereafter in May\\n             1954 the Executive Engineer re-checked the measurements and\\n             found that the previous checking had not been done properly.</span></span>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_420\\\">151   (1969) 3 SCC 392\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_508\\\">\\f                                            208</span>\\n\\n             Between March and May there could not be much rainfall, if at\\n             all, and the marks of digging according to the witnesses could not\\n             be obliterated during that time. It is however said that at the 6th\\n             and 7th mile the checking was done in July and by that time rains\\n             might have set in. Even so the witnesses at the sites of the pits\\n             could not be so considerably altered as to present a totally wrong\\n             picture. If anything had happened the earth would have swollen\\n             rather than contracted by reason of rain and the pits would have\\n             become bigger and not smaller. Anyway the questions which\\n             were put to the witnesses were recorded and sent to the Chief\\n             Engineer and his replies were received. No doubt the replies were\\n             not put in the hands of the appellant but he saw them at the time\\n             when he was making the representations and curiously enough\\n             he used those replies in his defence. In other words, they were\\n             not collected behind his back and could be used to his advantage\\n             and he had an opportunity of so using them in his defence. We\\n             do not think that any prejudice was caused to the appellant in\\n             this case by not examining the two retired Superintending\\n             Engineers whom he had cited or any one of them. The case was\\n             a simple one whether the measurement book had been properly\\n             checked. The pleas about rain and floods were utterly useless\\n             and the Chief Engineer’s elucidated replies were not against the\\n             appellant. In these circumstances a fetish of the principles of\\n             natural justice is not necessary to be made. We do not think that\\n             a case is made out that the principles of natural justice are\\n             violated.

What is the consequence if\\n             it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be\\n             imperative, the courts have decided that if it is not done the whole\\n             thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all void.\\n             On the other hand, when the courts hold a provision to be\\n             mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision\\n             may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings\\n             do not fail.”\\n             Later Lord Denning M.R. said, at pp. 242-243:\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_266\\\">             “The section is no doubt imperative in that the notice of appeal\\n             must be in writing and must be made within the specified time.\\n             But I think it is only directory as to the contents.

I cannot see any justification for the\\n              view that it is imperative as to one ground and not imperative as\\n              to the rest. If one was all that was necessary, an appellant would\\n              only have to put in one frivolous or hopeless ground and then\\n              amend later to add his real grounds. That would be a futile\\n              exercise. Then as to ‘stating the facts.’ It cannot be supposed\\n              that the appellant must at all cost state all the facts on which he\\n              bases his appeal. He has to state the facts, not the evidence: and\\n              the facts may depend on evidence yet to be obtained, and may\\n              not be fully or sufficiently known at the time when the notice of\\n              appeal is given. All things, considered, it seems to me that the\\n              section, in so far as the ‘grounds’ and ‘facts’ are concerned, must\\n              be construed as directory only: that is, as desiring information to\\n              be given about them.

It should be\\n              considered which of the provisions are substantive and which are\\n              secondary, that is, simply part of the machinery of the legislation.\\n              Further, the provisions which fall into the latter category should\\n              be examined to assess whether they are essential parts of the\\n              mechanics or are merely supportive of the other provisions so that\\n              they need not be insisted on regardless of the circumstances. In\\n              other words, as in the construction of contractual and similar\\n              documents, the status and effect of a provision has to be\\n              assessed having regard to the scheme of the legislation as a\\n              whole and the role of that provision in that scheme – for example,\\n              whether some provision confers an option properly so called,\\n              whether some provision is equivalent to a condition precedent,\\n              whether some requirement can be fulfilled in some other way or\\n              waived. Such an approach when applied to legislation such as\\n              the present would assist to enable the substantive rights to be\\n              given effect to and would help to avoid absurdities or unjustified\\n              lacunae.”\\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_516\\\">154</span>\\n      (1996) 3 W.L.R. 1008 at p. 1032\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_517\\\">\\f                                              211</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_428\\\">235. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"396572\\\" id=\\\"span_518\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/396572/\\\" id=\\\"a_1290\\\">Sharif-ud-Din</a> (supra) the difference between mandatory and\\n\\ndirectory rules was pointed out thus:</span>\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_268\\\">              “9. The difference between a mandatory rule and a directory rule\\n              is that while the former must be strictly observed, in the case of\\n              the latter substantial compliance may be sufficient to achieve the\\n              object regarding which the rule is enacted. Certain broad\\n              propositions which can be deduced from several decisions of\\n              courts regarding the rules of construction that should be followed\\n              in determining whether a provision of law is directory or\\n              mandatory may be summarised thus: The fact that the statute\\n              uses the word “shall” while laying down a duty is not conclusive\\n              on the question whether it is a mandatory or directory provision.\\n              In order to find out the true character of the legislation, the court\\n              has to ascertain the object which the provision of law in question\\n              has to subserve and its design and the context in which it is\\n              enacted. If the object of a law is to be defeated by non-compliance\\n              with it, it has to be regarded as mandatory. But when a provision\\n              of law relates to the performance of any public duty and the\\n              invalidation of any act done in disregard of that provision causes\\n              serious prejudice to those for whose benefit it is enacted and at\\n              the same time who have no control over the performance of the\\n              duty, such provision should be treated as a directory one. Where,\\n              however, a provision of law prescribes that a certain act has to\\n              be done in a particular manner by a person in order to acquire a\\n              right and it is coupled with another provision which confers an\\n              immunity on another when such act is not done in that manner,\\n              the former has to be regarded as a mandatory one. A procedural\\n              rule ordinarily should not be construed as mandatory if the defect\\n              in the act done in pursuance of it can be cured by permitting\\n              appropriate rectification to be carried out at a subsequent stage\\n              unless by according such permission to rectify the error later on,\\n              another rule would be contravened. Whenever a statute\\n              prescribes that a particular act is to be done in a particular\\n              manner and also lays down that failure to comply with the said\\n              requirement leads to a specific consequence, it would be difficult\\n              to hold that the requirement is not mandatory and the specified\\n              consequence should not follow.”\\n                                                              (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_429\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1542502\\\" id=\\\"span_519\\\">236.

Taking over the possession under\\n\\nthe Act of 2013 always amounted to taking over physical possession of\\n\\nthe land. When the State Government acquires land and drawns up a\\n\\nmemorandum of taking possession, that amounts to taking the physical\\n\\npossession of the land.

Once there is stay of dispossession, all further\\n        proceedings necessarily could not be proceeded with as <a href=\\\"/doc/546084/\\\" id=\\\"a_1392\\\">laid\\n        down by</a> this Court.

Equally, even if there is an irregularity in service of notice\\n        under <a href=\\\"/doc/1990166/\\\" id=\\\"a_1394\\\">Sections 9</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1395\\\">10</a>, it would be a curable irregularity and\\n        on account thereof, award made under <a href=\\\"/doc/291273/\\\" id=\\\"a_1396\\\">Section 11</a> does not\\n        become invalid. Award is only an offer on behalf of the State. If\\n        compensation was accepted without protest, it binds such party\\n        but subject to Section 28-A. Possession of the acquired land\\n        would be taken only by way of a memorandum, Panchnama,\\n        which is a legally accepted norm.

Thereby, it is seen that the appellant is not disabled to\\n              proceed with the continuation of the educational institution which\\n              it seeks to establish.

In such a case only symbolic possession could\\n              be taken, and as was pointed out by this Court in the aforesaid\\n              decision, such possession would amount to vesting the land in\\n              the Government. Moreover, four acres and odd belonging to the\\n              appellant was a part of the larger area of 118 acres notified for\\n              acquisition.

Before we go to various rival submissions, the pivotal question for\\n\\nconsideration is the interpretation of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1461\\\">Section 24</a> and aims and objectives\\n\\nof the Act of 2013.     <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1462\\\">Section 24</a> contemplates that the proceedings\\n\\ninitiated under the Act of 1894, are pending as on the date on which\\n\\nAct of 2013 has been enacted and if no award has been passed in the\\n\\nproceedings, then there is no lapse and only determination of\\n\\ncompensation has to be made under the Act of 2013. Where an award\\n\\nhas been passed, it is provided under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1463\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a>, the pending\\n\\nproceedings shall continue under the provisions of the Act of 1894 as if\\n\\nthe old Act has not been repealed. The provisions totally exclude the\\n\\napplicability of any provision of Act of 2013. There are two requirements\\n\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1464\\\">Section 24(2)</a>, which are to be met by the Authorities, where\\n\\naward has been made 5 years or more prior to the commencement of\\n\\nthe Act of 2013, if the physical possession of the land has not been\\n\\ntaken nor compensation has been paid. If possession has been taken,\\n\\ncompensation has to be paid by the acquiring authorities. The time of\\n\\nfive years is provided for authorities to take action, not to sleep over the\\n\\nmatter. In case of lethargy or machinery and default on the part of the\\n\\nAuthorities and for no other reason the lapse is provided.        Lapse is\\n\\nprovided only in case of default by Authorities acquiring the land, not\\n\\ncaused by any other reason or order of the court.               When the\\n\\ninterpretation of the provision is clear, there was no necessity for\\n\\nParliament to make such a provision under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1465\\\">Section 24(2)</a> for exclusion\\n\\nof the period of the interim order. Though it has excluded the period of\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_639\\\">\\f                                   245</span>\\n\\ninterim order for making declaration under the proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1166255/\\\" id=\\\"a_1466\\\">Sections 19(7)</a>\\n\\nand exclusion has also been made for computation of the period under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_1467\\\">Section 69</a> of the Act of 2013. It is due to the necessity to provide so in\\n\\nview of the language of the provision. Under <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_1468\\\">section 69</a> of the Act of\\n\\n2013, additional compensation at the rate of 12 per cent has to be given\\n\\non market value for the period commencing from the date of the\\n\\npublication of the preliminary notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/291273/\\\" id=\\\"a_1469\\\">Section 11</a>.         The\\n\\nadditional compensation at the rate of 12 per cent has been excluded\\n\\nfor the period acquisition proceedings have been held up on account of\\n\\nthe interim injunction order of any court. The provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1470\\\">Section 24</a>\\n\\ncast an obligation upon the Authorities to take steps meaning thereby\\n\\nthat it is open to them to take such steps, and inaction or lethargy on\\n\\ntheir part has not been countenanced by Parliament. Resultantly, lapse\\n\\nof proceedings takes place. It is by the very nature of the provisions if\\n\\nit was not possible for authorities for any reason not attributable to\\n\\nthem or the Government to take requisite steps, the period has to be\\n\\nexcluded. The Minister concerned Shri Jairam Ramesh in answer to\\n\\nthe debate quoted above has made it clear that time limit of five years\\n\\nhas been fixed for the Authorities to take action. If we do not exclude\\n\\nthe period of interim order, the very spirit of the provision will be\\n\\nviolated.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_506\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_507\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"16653152\\\" id=\\\"span_640\\\">283.

There was no necessity of making such a provision\\n\\neven if this proposition has been discussed during the formulation of\\n\\nlegislation.

Once award is made,\\n\\npossession can be taken and on that the land vests in State under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/562722/\\\" id=\\\"a_1479\\\">section 16</a>, and under <a href=\\\"/doc/423817/\\\" id=\\\"a_1480\\\">Section 17(1)</a> of the Act of 1894, the possession\\n\\nof any land can be taken for public purposes in cases of urgency without\\n\\npassing of the award.      The expression “acquisition proceedings” is\\n\\nreferred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1481\\\">Section 24</a> and its proviso\\n\\nmakes it clear that in case in majority of the landholdings compensation\\n\\nhas not been deposited, all the beneficiaries as on the date of\\n\\nnotification under <a href=\\\"/doc/43654/\\\" id=\\\"a_1482\\\">Section 4</a> (of the Act of 1894) shall be entitled to\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_645\\\">\\f                                    248</span>\\n\\ncompensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.\\n\\nThat also intends to give benefits to all the concerned.      Payment of\\n\\ncompensation too has to be made.

In the opinion of this court it is not the intendment of the Act of\\n\\n2013 that those who have litigated should get benefits of higher\\n\\ncompensation as contemplated under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1485\\\">Section 24</a> benefit is conferred on\\n\\nall beneficiaries. It is not intended by the provisions that in piecemeal\\n\\nthe persons who have litigated and have obtained the interim order\\n\\nshould get the benefits of the provisions of the Act of 2013. Those who\\n\\nhave accepted the compensation within 5 years and handed over the\\n\\npossession too, are to be benefited, in case amount has not been\\n\\ndeposited with respect to majority of holdings. There are cases in which\\n\\nprojects have come up in part and as per plan rest of the area is required\\n\\nfor planned development with respect to which interim stays have been\\n\\nobtained. It is not the intendment of the law to deliver advantage to\\n\\nrelentless litigants. It cannot be said hence, that it was due to the\\n\\ninaction of the authorities that possession could not be taken within 5\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_646\\\">\\f                                    249</span>\\n\\nyears. Public policy is not to foment or foster litigation but put an end\\n\\nto it. In several instances, in various High Courts writ petitions were\\n\\ndismissed by single judge Benches and the writ appeals were pending\\n\\nfor a long time and in which, with respect to part of land of the projects,\\n\\nefforts were made to obtain the benefit of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1486\\\">Section 24(2)</a>. Parliament in\\n\\nour view did not intend to confer benefits to such litigants for the\\n\\naforementioned reasons. Litigation may be frivolous or may be worthy.\\n\\nSuch litigants have to stand on the strength of their own case and in\\n\\nsuch a case provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_1487\\\">Section 114</a> of the Act of 2013 and <a href=\\\"/doc/1030013/\\\" id=\\\"a_1488\\\">Section 6</a>\\n\\nof the General Clauses Act, 1897, are clearly attracted and such\\n\\nproceedings have to be continued under the provisions of the old Act\\n\\nthat would be in the spirit of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1489\\\">Section 24(1)(b)</a> itself of the Act of 2013.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/719484/\\\" id=\\\"a_1490\\\">Section 6(b)</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897, provides that repeal will\\n\\nnot affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or\\n\\nanything duly done or suffered thereunder.       <a href=\\\"/doc/1792838/\\\" id=\\\"a_1491\\\">Section 6(c)</a> states that\\n\\nrepeal would not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability\\n\\nacquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so repealed.

It was submitted on behalf of acquiring authorities that principle\\n\\nof casus omissus is not necessarily applicable in all the cases. Reliance\\n\\nhas been placed on Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher185, in which\\n\\nfollowing observations have been made:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_312\\\">               “The question for decision in this case is whether we are at\\n              liberty to extend the ordinary meaning of “burden” so as to\\n              include a contingent burden of the kind I have described. Now\\n              this court has already held that this sub-section is to be liberally\\n              construed so as to give effect to the governing principles embodied\\n              in the legislation (Winchester Court Ld. v. Miller); and I think we\\n              should do the same.           Whenever a statute comes up for\\n              consideration it must be remembered that it is not within human\\n              powers to foresee the manifold sets of facts which may arise,\\n              and, even if it were, it is not possible to provide for them in terms\\n              free from all ambiguity. The English language is not an\\n              instrument of mathematical precision. Our literature would be\\n              much the poorer if it were. This is where the draftsmen of Acts of\\n              Parliament have often been unfairly criticized. A judge, believing\\n              himself to be fettered by the supposed rule that he must look to\\n              the language and nothing else, laments that the draftsmen have\\n              not provided for this or that, or have been guilty of some or other\\n              ambiguity. It would certainly save the judges trouble if Acts of\\n              Parliament were drafted with divine prescience and perfect\\n\\n185   (1949) 2 K.B. 481\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_648\\\">\\f                                             251</span>\\n\\n              clarity. In the absence of it, when a defect appears a judge\\n              cannot simply fold his hands and blame the draftsman. He must\\n              set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of\\n              Parliament, and he must do this not only from the language of the\\n              statute, but also from a consideration of the social conditions\\n              which gave rise to it, and of the mischief which it was passed to\\n              remedy, and then he must supplement the written word sc as to\\n              give “force and life” to the intention of the legislature. That was\\n              clearly laid down by the resolution of the judges in Heydon’s\\n              case, and it is the safest guide to-day. Good practical advice on\\n              the subject was given about the same time by Plowden in his\\n              second volume Evston v. Studd. Put into homely metaphor it is\\n              this: A judge should ask himself the question: If the makers of the\\n              Act had themselves come across this ruck in the texture of it, how\\n              would they have straightened it out? He must then do as they\\n              would have done. A judge must not alter the material of which it\\n              is woven, but he can and should iron out the creases.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_516\\\">              Approaching this case in that way, I cannot help feeling that the\\n              legislature had not specifically in mind a contingent burden such\\n              as we have here. If it had, would it not have put it on the same\\n              footing as an actual burden? I think it would. It would have\\n              permitted an increase of rent when the terms were so changed as\\n              to put a positive legal burden on the landlord. If the parties\\n              expressly agreed between themselves the amount of the increase\\n              on that account the court would give effect to their agreement.\\n              But if, as here, they did not direct their minds to the point, the\\n              court has itself to assess the amount of the increase. It has to\\n              say how much the tenant should pay &quot;in respect of&quot; the transfer\\n              of this burden to the landlord. It should do this by asking what\\n              a willing tenant would agree to pay and a willing landlord would\\n              agree to accept in respect of it. Just as in the earlier cases the\\n              courts were able to assess the value of the &quot;fair wear and tear&quot;\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_313\\\">              clause, and of a &quot;cooker.&quot; So they can assess the value of the hot\\n              water clause and translate it fairly in terms of rent; and what\\n              applies to hot water applies also to the removal of refuse and so\\n              forth. I agree that the appeal should be allowed, and with the\\n              order proposed by Asquith LJ.”\\n                                                           (emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_517\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"483899\\\" id=\\\"span_649\\\">289.

The\\n             officer drafting a particular piece of subordinate legislation in the\\n             Executive Department may employ words with a view to leaving\\n             no scope for possible doubt as to its intention or sometimes even\\n             for greater completeness, though these words may not add\\n             anything to the meaning and scope of the subordinate legislation.</span>\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_521\\\">             Here, in the present notifications, the words duty of excise\\n             leviable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/110162683/\\\" id=\\\"a_1517\\\">Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944</a>’ do not find\\n             a place as in the other notifications relied upon by the\\n             respondents.

The question that arises for\\n            consideration is whether the stay obtained by some of the\\n            persons who prohibited the respondents from publication of the\\n            declaration under <a href=\\\"/doc/1792838/\\\" id=\\\"a_1548\\\">Section 6</a> would equally be extendible to the\\n            cases relating to the appellants. We proceed on the premise that\\n            the appellants had not obtained any stay of the publication of the\\n            declaration but since the High Court in some of the cases has, in\\n            fact, prohibited them as extracted hereinbefore, from publication\\n            of the declaration, necessarily, when the Court has not restricted\\n            the declaration in the impugned orders in support of the\\n            petitioners therein, the officers had to hold back their hands till\\n            the matters were disposed of.

As a consequence, the stay granted in respect of some\\n            would be applicable to others also who had not obtained stay in\\n            that behalf. We are not concerned with the correctness of the\\n            earlier direction with regard to Section 5-A enquiry and\\n            consideration of objections as it was not challenged by the\\n            respondent Union.

No dictionary or any outside assistance is needed to\\n             understand the meaning of these simple words in the context and\\n             scheme of the Coal Act. The interest has to enure to the benefit of\\n             the owners of the coal mines. The claims before the Commissioner\\n             under the Coal Act are from the creditors of the owners, and the\\n             liabilities sought to be discharged are also of the owners of the\\n             coal mines.

It is a well-settled principle\\n        in law that the court cannot read anything into a statutory\\n        provision which is plain and unambiguous. A statute is an edict\\n        of the legislature. The language employed in a statute is the\\n        determinative factor of legislative intent. The first and primary\\n        rule of construction is that the intention of the legislation must be\\n        found in words used by the legislature itself.

Generally, the rights of the Crown to recover the debt would\\n              prevail over the right of a subject. Crown debt means the &quot;debts\\n              due to the State or the King; debts which a prerogative entitles\\n              the Crown to claim priority for before all other creditors.&quot; [See\\n              Advanced Law Lexicon by P.

For all these reasons, it is held that the omission to expressly\\n\\nenact a provision, that excludes the period during which any interim\\n\\norder was operative, preventing the State from taking possession of\\n\\nacquired land, or from giving effect to the award, in a particular case or\\n\\ncases, cannot result in the inclusion of such period or periods for the\\n\\npurpose of reckoning the period of 5 years.

This Court notices, in this context, that even under\\n\\nthe new Act (nor was it so under the 1894 Act) no provision has been\\n\\nenacted, for lapse of the entire acquisition, for non-payment of\\n\\ncompensation within a specified time; nor has any such provision been\\n\\nmade   regarding      possession.      Furthermore,        non-compliance       with\\n\\npayment and deposit provisions (under Section 77) only results in\\n\\nhigher interest pay-outs under Section 80.

I consider that in such cases where the court\\nfinds that using the courts as a tool, a litigant has perpetuated\\nillegalities or has perpetuated an illegal possession, the court\\nmust impose costs on such litigants which should be equal to the\\nbenefits derived by the litigant and harm and deprivation\\nsuffered by the rightful person so as to check the frivolous\\nlitigation and prevent the people from reaping a rich harvest of\\nillegal acts through the courts. One of the aims of every judicial\\nsystem has to be to discourage unjust enrichment using courts as\\na tool.

This class of people who\\nperpetuate illegal acts by obtaining stays and injunctions from\\nthe courts must be made to pay the sufferer not only the entire\\nillegal gains made by them as costs to the person deprived of his\\nright but also must be burdened with exemplary costs. The faith\\nof people in judiciary can only be sustained if the persons on the\\nright side of the law do not feel that even if they keep fighting for\\njustice in the court and ultimately win, they would turn out to be\\na fool since winning a case after 20 or 30 years would make the\\nwrongdoer as real gainer, who had reaped the benefits for all\\nthose years. Thus, it becomes the duty of the courts to see that\\nsuch wrongdoers are discouraged at every step, and even if they\\nsucceed in prolonging the litigation due to their money power,\\nultimately, they must suffer the costs of all these years&#x27; long\\nlitigation.

A different approach would mean that, for\\n\\ninstance, where two landowners (sought to be displaced from their lands\\n\\nby the same notification) are awarded compensation, of whom one\\n\\nallows the issue to attain finality- and moves on, the other obdurately\\n\\nseeks to stall the public purpose underlying the acquisition, by filing\\n\\none or series of litigation, during the pendency of which interim orders\\n\\nmight inure and bind the parties, the latter would profit and be\\n\\nrewarded, with the deemed lapse condition under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1673\\\">Section 24 (2)</a>.

Union of India229</a> was an instance in\\n\\nwhich a claim was made that acquisition was made more than a century\\n\\nago, and compensation has not been paid as such acquisition has\\n\\nlapsed relating to the land of Raisina Hills in New Delhi. The importance\\n\\nof Raisina Hills is well-known to everybody. The grossest misuse of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1690\\\">Section 24</a> has been sought to be made, which is intended to confer\\n\\nbenefit. It was never intended to revive such claims and be used in the\\n\\nmanner in which it has been today, where large numbers of acquisitions\\n\\nand development projects, such as construction of roads, hospitals,\\n\\ntownships, housing projects, etc., are sought to be undone, though\\n\\nsuch acquisitions have been settled in several rounds of litigation. In\\n\\nseveral matters, the validity has been questioned under the guise as if\\n\\nthe right has been conferred for the first time under the Act of 2013,\\n\\nclaiming that such acquisitions have lapsed. There are also cases in\\n\\nwhich the claims for release of land under <a href=\\\"/doc/460525/\\\" id=\\\"a_1691\\\">Section 48</a> of the Act of 1894\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n229   (2018) 3 SCC 588\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_800\\\">\\f                                    296</span>\\n\\nhave been dismissed. Now, claims are made that as land is open and\\n\\nlandowners/intermediaries/POA holders continue to be in physical\\n\\npossession, thus, it should be returned to them, as the acquisition has\\n\\nlapsed under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1692\\\">Section 24(2)</a>. Before us also arguments have been raised\\n\\nto grant relief in all such cases by making purposive interpretation of\\n\\nbenevolent provisions. It was urged that this Court is bound to give\\n\\nrelief as <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1693\\\">Section 24</a> is retrospective in operation, and the authorities\\n\\nhave not cared to take possession for more than five years or more, and\\n\\nthey have not paid the compensation and deposited it in treasury which\\n\\ncannot be said to be legal.

After repeal, it was claimed that actual physical possession\\n\\nhas not been taken by the State Government as such repeal has the\\n\\neffect of effacing the proceedings of taking possession, which it was\\n\\nalleged, was not in accordance with the law.      <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"103932958\\\" id=\\\"span_803\\\">In <a href=\\\"/doc/103932958/\\\" id=\\\"a_1699\\\">State of Assam v.\\n\\nBhaskar Jyoti Sarma and Ors230</a>, submission was raised by the State of\\n\\nAssam that physical possession has been taken over by the competent\\n\\nauthority and it was submitted on behalf of landowner that procedure\\n\\nprescribed under <a href=\\\"/doc/1005850/\\\" id=\\\"a_1700\\\">Section 10(5)</a> of the Urban Land (Ceiling and\\n\\nRegulation) Act, 1976, was not followed.

It was urged that mere non-\\n\\ncompliance with <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1704\\\">Section 10(5)</a> would be insufficient to attract the\\n\\n\\n\\n230   (2015) 5 SCC 321\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_804\\\">\\f                                        298</span>\\n\\nprovisions of Section 3 of the Repeal Act.

In reality therefore\\n        unless there was something that was inherently wrong so as to\\n        affect the very process of taking over such as the identity of the\\n        land or the boundaries thereof or any other circumstance of a\\n        similar nature going to the root of the matter hence requiring an\\n        adjudication, a person who had lost his land by reason of the\\n        same being declared surplus under <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1709\\\">Section 10(3)</a> would not\\n        consider it worthwhile to agitate the violation of <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1710\\\">Section 10(5)</a> for\\n        he can well understand that even when the Court may uphold his\\n        contention that the procedure ought to be followed as prescribed,\\n        it may still be not enough for him to retain the land for the\\n        authorities could the very next day dispossess him from the same\\n        by simply serving a notice under <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1711\\\">Section 10(5)</a>. It would, in that\\n        view, be an academic exercise for any owner or person in\\n        possession to find fault with his dispossession on the ground that\\n        no notice under <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1712\\\">Section 10(5)</a> had been served upon him.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_369\\\">        16. The issue can be viewed from another angle also. Assuming\\n        that a person in possession could make a grievance, no matter\\n        without much gain in the ultimate analysis, the question is\\n        whether such grievance could be made long after the alleged\\n        violation of <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1713\\\">Section 10(5)</a>. If actual physical possession was taken\\n        over from the erstwhile landowner on 7-12-1991 as is alleged in\\n        the present case, any grievance based on <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1714\\\">Section 10(5)</a> ought to\\n        have been made within a reasonable time of such dispossession.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_616\\\">        If the owner did not do so, forcibly taking over of possession\\n        would acquire legitimacy by sheer lapse of time.

Any other\\n        view would, in our opinion, give a license to a litigant to make a\\n        grievance not because he has suffered any real prejudice that\\n        needs to be redressed but only because the fortuitous\\n        circumstance of a Repeal Act tempted him to raise the issue\\n        regarding his dispossession being in violation of the prescribed\\n        procedure.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_617\\\">        <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"1683667\\\" id=\\\"span_805\\\">17.

In the case at hand, if the appellant&#x27;s version regarding\\n         dispossession of the erstwhile owner in December 1991 is\\n         correct, the fact that such dispossession was without a notice\\n         under <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1724\\\">Section 10(5)</a> will be of no consequence and would not\\n         vitiate or obliterate the Act of taking possession for the purposes\\n         of Section 3 of the Repeal Act. That is because Bhabadeb Sarma,\\n         erstwhile owner, had not made any grievance based on breach\\n         of <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1725\\\">Section 10(5)</a> at any stage during his lifetime, implying thereby\\n         that he had waived his right to do so.”\\n\\n\\n\\n     This Court held that provisions of the Repeal Act could not be\\n\\nextended in such a case where possession has been taken without\\n\\nfollowing the procedure, and the landowner cannot retain the land. This\\n\\nCourt also observed that once possession has been taken over in the\\n\\nyear 1991, any grievance as to non-compliance of <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1726\\\">Section 10(5)</a> ought\\n\\nto have been made within a reasonable time of such dispossession. By\\n\\nsheer lapse of time, the possession would acquire legitimacy. Thus, the\\n\\nowner or the person in possession must be deemed to have waived his\\n\\nright under <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_1727\\\">Section 10(5)</a> of the Act. This Court also observed that only\\n\\nbecause of the fortuitous circumstance of a Repeal Act, which confers\\n\\ncertain rights, the litigation had tempted the landowner to raise the\\n\\nissue regarding his dispossession being in violation of the prescribed\\n\\nprocedure.   It is clear from the aforesaid decision that such claims\\n\\ncannot be entertained, and any such dispute raised belatedly was\\n\\nrepelled by this Court.</span>\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_808\\\">\\f                                     300</span><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_618\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_619\\\">342. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1728\\\">Section 24(2)</a> is sought to be used as an umbrella so as to question\\n\\nthe concluded proceedings in which possession has been taken,\\n\\ndevelopment has been made, and compensation has been deposited,\\n\\nbut may be due to refusal, it has not been collected.

It is open to the department to file a statement by\\n             way of answer to the objections filed by the landowners. The\\n             submission of the writ petitioners was that in a given case, it\\n             might well happen that in the light of the objections submitted by\\n             the landowners, the department concerned may decide to drop\\n             the acquisition. Since no such opportunity was given to the\\n             department concerned herein, it could not file its statement by\\n             way of answer to their objections.

The\\n\\nprovisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1835\\\">Section 24</a> do not invalidate the judgments and orders of\\n\\nthe Court, where rights and claims have been lost and negatived. There\\n\\nis no revival of the barred claims by operation of law. Thus, stale and\\n\\ndead claims cannot be permitted to be canvassed on the pretext of\\n\\nenactment of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1836\\\">Section 24</a>. In exceptional cases, when in fact, the\\n\\npayment has not been made, but possession has been taken, the\\n\\nremedy lies elsewhere if the case is not covered by the proviso. It is the\\n\\nCourt to consider it independently not under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1837\\\">section 24(2)</a> of the Act of\\n\\n2013.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_648\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_649\\\">360. It was submitted that Section 101 provides for return of unutilized\\n\\nland under the Act of 2013. Section 101 provides that in case land is\\n\\nnot utilized for five years from the date of taking over the possession,\\n\\nthe same shall be returned to the original owner or owners or their legal\\n\\nheirs, as the case may be, or to the Land Bank of the appropriate\\n\\nGovernment by reversion in the manner as may be prescribed by the\\n\\nappropriate Government. Section 101 reads as under:\\n\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_387\\\">         “101. Return of unutilized land.-- When any land, acquired\\n         under this Act remains unutilized for a period of five years from\\n         the date of taking over the possession, the same shall be returned\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_866\\\">\\f                                       315</span>\\n\\n         to the original owner or owners or their legal heirs, as the case\\n         may be, or to the Land Bank of the appropriate Government by\\n         reversion in the manner as may be prescribed by the appropriate\\n         Government.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_388\\\">         Explanation.-- For the purpose of this section, &quot;Land Bank&quot; means\\n         a governmental entity that focuses on the conversion of\\n         Government-owned vacant, abandoned, unutilized acquired\\n         lands and tax-delinquent properties into productive use.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_650\\\">361. <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1838\\\">Section 24</a> deals with lapse of acquisition. Section 101 deals with\\n\\nthe return of unutilized land. Section 101 cannot be said to be\\n\\napplicable to an acquisition made under the Act of 1894. The provision\\n\\nof lapse has to be considered on its own strength and not by virtue of\\n\\nSection 101 though the spirit is to give back the land to the original\\n\\nowner or owners or the legal heirs or to the Land Bank. Return of lands\\n\\nis with respect to all lands acquired under the Act of 2013 as the\\n\\nexpression used in the opening part is &quot;When any land, acquired under\\n\\nthis Act remains unutilized&quot;. Lapse, on the other hand, occurs when the\\n\\nState does not take steps in terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1839\\\">Section 24(2)</a>. The provisions of\\n\\nSection 101 cannot be applied to the acquisitions made under the Act\\n\\nof 1894. Thus, no such sustenance can be drawn from the provisions\\n\\ncontained in <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_1840\\\">Section 101</a> of the Act of 2013. Five years&#x27; logic has been\\n\\ncarried into effect for the purpose of lapse and not for the purpose of\\n\\nreturning the land remaining unutilized under <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1841\\\">Section 24(2)</a>.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_651\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"185065833\\\" id=\\\"span_867\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"185065833\\\" id=\\\"span_868\\\">362.

The word ‘or’ used in <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1850\\\">Section 24(2)</a> between possession and\\n\\ncompensation has to be read as ‘nor’ or as ‘and’.

Similarly, if compensation has been paid, possession has\\n\\nnot been taken then there is no lapse.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_392\\\">4. The expression &#x27;paid&#x27; in the main part of <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1852\\\">Section 24(2)</a> of the Act of\\n\\n2013 does not include a deposit of compensation in court. The\\n\\nconsequence of non-deposit is provided in proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1485112/\\\" id=\\\"a_1853\\\">Section 24(2)</a> in\\n\\ncase it has not been deposited with respect to majority of land holdings\\n\\nthen all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land\\n\\nacquisition under <a href=\\\"/doc/43654/\\\" id=\\\"a_1854\\\">Section 4</a> of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to\\n\\ncompensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013.

Non-deposit of compensation (in court) does not result in the\\n\\nlapse of land acquisition proceedings. In case of non-deposit with\\n\\nrespect to the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation\\n\\nunder the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the &quot;landowners&quot; as on the\\n\\ndate of notification for land acquisition under <a href=\\\"/doc/43654/\\\" id=\\\"a_1857\\\">Section 4</a> of the Act of\\n\\n1894.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_393\\\">5.
