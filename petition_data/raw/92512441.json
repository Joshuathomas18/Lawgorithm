NARIMAN, J.\\n\\n\\n1.     Leave granted.\\n\\n\\n2.     A batch of appeals before us by the Union of India question\\n\\nthe view of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which is that the\\n\\nnon-grant of solatium and interest to lands acquired under the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">National Highways Act</a>, which is available if lands are acquired\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, is bad in law, and consequently that\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/118663988/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section 3J</a> of the National Highways Act, 1956 be struck down as\\n\\nbeing violative of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India to this extent.\\n\\n\\n3.     The facts of one of these appeals may be taken up as\\n\\nillustrative of the points for consideration in all these appeals. In\\n\\nUnion of India &amp; Anr. v. Tarsem Singh &amp; Ors. (Civil Appeal No. 7064\\n\\nof 2019 @ SLP (C) No.9599 of 2019), a notification dated\\n\\n24.12.2004 was issued under <a href=\\\"/doc/160012649/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">Section 3A</a> of the National Highways\\n\\nAct, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act”), intending to acquire\\n\\nland belonging to the Respondents for the purpose of four-laning\\n\\nNational Highway No.1-A on certain stretches of the Jalandhar-\\n\\nPathankot section as well as the Pathankot-Jammu section falling\\n\\nwithin the State of Punjab. On 11 th July, 2005, the said lands were\\n\\ndeclared to have vested in the State pursuant to <a href=\\\"/doc/58521706/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Section 3D(2)</a> of\\n                                                                         5\\n\\fthe said Act.   On 5th October 2006, the competent authority under\\n\\nthe Act passed an Award in which compensation was calculated at\\n\\nRs.4,219/- per marla or Rs.6.75 lakhs per acre. As this Award was\\n\\ndisputed by the Respondents, an Arbitrator was appointed under the\\n\\nAct, who then arrived at a figure of Rs.1.5 lakhs per marla as\\n\\ncompensation. It is important to note that as no solatium or interest\\n\\nis provided by the Act, such solatium and interest was not awarded\\n\\nby the learned Arbitrator. Meanwhile, a Section 34 application filed\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/1052228/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">Arbitration Act</a> by the Union of India was dismissed on the\\n\\nground that it was hopelessly time-barred.       On appeal to the\\n\\nDivision Bench of the High Court, it was found on facts that as the\\n\\namount of compensation awarded was not challenged in certain\\n\\ncases, the National Highways Authority of India being “State” under\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/609139/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution cannot be permitted to pick and\\n\\nchoose between persons similarly situate, as a result of which the\\n\\nappeal against valuation at the rate of 1.5 lakhs per marla was\\n\\nrejected. However, the Court deleted the grant of severance and\\n\\n18% interest if the awarded amount is not paid within six months,\\n\\nfollowing an earlier Division Bench judgment of the same Court. The\\n\\nCourt then went on to state that despite the fact that no appeal has\\n\\nbeen filed against the learned Single Judge’s judgment by the\\n\\nowners, yet compensation for acquired land being in the nature of\\n\\n                                                                    6\\n\\fbeneficial legislation, they would be bound by an earlier Division\\n\\nBench judgment which requires the National Highway Authority to\\n\\npay solatium and, therefore, directed payment of solatium at the\\n\\nrate of 30%, as laid down in the said judgment.\\n\\n\\n4.       Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on\\n\\nbehalf of the Union of India and NHAI, took us through the relevant\\n\\nprovisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a> as well as the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">National\\n\\nHighways Act</a>. According to him, the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">National Highways Act</a> is a\\n\\ncomplete Code which expressly excluded the application of the\\n\\nprovisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, and this being so, it is clear\\n\\nthat absent discrimination or manifest arbitrariness, the non-award\\n\\nof solatium and interest that is awardable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act</a> would not fall foul of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of\\n\\nIndia.   According to the learned Senior Advocate, it is not possible\\n\\nto choose between one Acquisition Act and another, as the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">National\\n\\nHighways Act</a> alone would apply when land is acquired for the\\n\\npurpose of National Highways.         This being the case, all the\\n\\njudgments that are cited by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in\\n\\nM/s Golden Iron and Steel Forging vs. Union of India 2011 (4) RCR\\n\\n(Civil) 375, would, therefore, not apply.     According to him,     the\\n\\nDivision Bench of the Rajasthan High Court in Banshilal Samariya\\n\\n\\n                                                                       7\\n\\fvs Union of India 2005-06 Supp RLW 559, correctly distinguished\\n\\nthis line of cases and equally correctly followed a line of judgments\\n\\nunder various state town planning <a href=\\\"/doc/434865/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Acts,      the Requisitioning and\\n\\nAcquisition of Immovable Property Act, 1952</a> and the <a href=\\\"/doc/166591641/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Defence of\\n\\nIndia Act, 1971</a> to arrive at the conclusion that solatium and interest\\n\\nneed not be paid in cases covered under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">National Highways\\n\\nAct</a>. He further argued that given the fact that market value on the\\n\\ndate of publication of the <a href=\\\"/doc/160012649/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Section 3A</a> notification was to be given at\\n\\nthe full market rate, there could be no fundamental right violated as\\n\\nsolatium and interest that are granted are mere statutory rights\\n\\nwhich can be awarded if the statute so enjoins, and equally need\\n\\nnot be awarded where a separate special statute expressly\\n\\nexcludes them.    He also contended, somewhat feebly, that since\\n\\nonly strips of land adjoining the National Highways were required to\\n\\nbe acquired, in many cases, the landowners would have properties\\n\\nwhich would not be subject to acquisition left with them, obviating\\n\\nany need to pay solatium to them.     Finally, he also referred to and\\n\\nrelied upon <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Article 31-C</a> of the Constitution to argue that if at all\\n\\nthere was an infraction of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">Article 14</a>, the Amendment Act of 1997 to\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">National Highways Act, 1956</a>, enacting <a href=\\\"/doc/160012649/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Sections 3A</a> to <a href=\\\"/doc/118663988/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">3J</a>, being\\n\\nin furtherance of the Directive Principle contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_25\\\">Article 39(b)</a><a href=\\\"/doc/691208/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">,\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                     8</a>\\n\\fwould be shielded from attack on the ground that <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_27\\\">Article 14</a> of the\\n\\nConstitution has been violated.\\n\\n\\n5.     Shri Amit Sibal, learned Senior Advocate, together with Shri\\n\\nNeeraj Kumar Jain, defended the view of the Punjab and Haryana\\n\\nHigh Court in M/s Golden Iron and Steel Forging (supra) by\\n\\npointing out that the object sought to be achieved by the 1997\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_28\\\">Amendment Act to the National Highways Act, 1956</a> was far\\n\\nremoved from the Directive Principle contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_29\\\">Article 39(b)</a> and,\\n\\ntherefore, did not    receive the protection of <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_30\\\">Article 31-C</a> of the\\n\\nConstitution of India.   They argued that the main object of the\\n\\nAmendment Act was the speedy implementation of Highway\\n\\nprojects, which could only be achieved by expediting the process of\\n\\nland acquisition.    This being the case, excluding solatium and\\n\\ninterest that is awardable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_31\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> results in a\\n\\ndiscrimination between persons who are similarly situate so far as\\n\\nlands are acquired by the Union of India from them for the purpose\\n\\nof national highways as opposed to other public purposes, having\\n\\nno rational relation to the object of the 1997 amendment. They were\\n\\nat pains to point out that “solatium” is awarded because of the\\n\\ncompulsory nature of acquisition, which is present whether the land\\n\\nis acquired for the National Highways or for any other public\\n\\n\\n                                                                     9\\n\\fpurpose.    They, therefore, argued that solatium and interest are\\n\\nintegral parts of compensation that is awardable to persons whose\\n\\nlands have been compulsorily expropriated. They took us through\\n\\nthe provisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/434865/\\\" id=\\\"a_32\\\">Requisitioning and Acquisition of the\\n\\nImmovable Property Act, 1952</a> and the <a href=\\\"/doc/166591641/\\\" id=\\\"a_33\\\">Defence of India Act, 1971</a>,\\n\\nand stated that the judgments that were delivered under those Acts,\\n\\nwhich upheld the non-grant of solatium, was because requisition\\n\\nwas first made of private property for public purposes under those\\n\\nActs, for which compensation was granted.         Possession having\\n\\nbeen taken by the State, such properties could be handed back\\n\\nunder those Acts once the purpose of requisitioning such properties\\n\\nwas over. Also, it was only in very limited circumstances that such\\n\\nrequisitioned property was to be acquired, which, therefore,\\n\\nobviated payment of any solatium. They, therefore, relied upon the\\n\\nline of authorities which struck down provisions of statutes which did\\n\\nnot grant solatium where land was acquired without first being\\n\\nrequisitioned. They also took us through the judgment of the\\n\\nDivision Bench of the Rajasthan High Court and pointed out that this\\n\\nbasic distinction between the two sets of applicable precedents was\\n\\nnot properly appreciated, leading the High Court to follow the wrong\\n\\nline of authority.   On merits, they argued that in some cases in the\\n\\nSupreme Court itself, the then Solicitor General, Shri Ranjit Kumar,\\n\\n                                                                   10\\n\\fexpressly stated that solatium will be paid to some of the persons\\n\\nwho are covered by notifications under <a href=\\\"/doc/160012649/\\\" id=\\\"a_34\\\">Section 3A</a> of the National\\n\\nHighways Act.      This apart, as was correctly observed by the\\n\\nDivision Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the\\n\\nimpugned judgment, the National Highway Authority being “State”\\n\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/609139/\\\" id=\\\"a_35\\\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot file objections in\\n\\ncertain cases and accept arbitration awards in others. In any case,\\n\\nno case has been made out under the limited jurisdiction to\\n\\nchallenge arbitral awards under <a href=\\\"/doc/536284/\\\" id=\\\"a_36\\\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration and\\n\\nConciliation Act, 1996.\\n\\n\\n6.     Having heard the learned counsel on both sides, it is\\n\\nnecessary to first mention that the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_37\\\">National Highways Act, 1956</a>, as\\n\\noriginally enacted, did not provide for acquisition of land. Thus, till\\n\\nthe   National   Highways    Laws    (Amendment) Act,        1997,   all\\n\\nacquisitions for the purpose of National Highways were made under\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_38\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, and the owners were given, in addition to\\n\\nmarket value, solatium as well as interest under the provisions of\\n\\nthat Act.\\n\\n\\n7.     Coming to the Amendment Act of 1997, it is important to set\\n\\nout the Objects and Reasons that led to the aforesaid amendment.\\n\\nThey are:\\n\\n                                                                     11\\n\\f“1. In order to create an environment to promote private\\ninvestment in national highways, to speed up\\nconstruction of highways and to remove bottlenecks in\\ntheir proper management, it was considered necessary\\nto amend the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_39\\\">National Highways Act, 1956</a> and the\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/82478050/\\\" id=\\\"a_40\\\">National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988</a>.\\n2. One of the impediments in the speedy implementation\\nof highways projects has been inordinate delay in the\\nacquisition of land. In order to expedite the process of\\nland acquisition, it is proposed that once the Central\\nGovernment declares that the land is required for public\\npurposes for development of a highway, that land will\\nvest in the Government and only the amount by way of\\ncompensation is to be paid and any dispute relating to\\ncompensation will be subject to adjudication through the\\nprocess of arbitration.\\n3. It was also felt necessary to ensure continuity of the\\nstatus of bypasses built through private investment. To\\nachieve this, it is proposed to amend the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_41\\\">National\\nHighways Act, 1956</a> so as to include the highway\\nstretches situated within any municipal area as a part of\\nNational Highway. Further, as the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_42\\\">National Highways\\nAct, 1956</a> permits participation of the private sector in\\nthe development of the National Highways, it became\\nimperative to amend the <a href=\\\"/doc/82478050/\\\" id=\\\"a_43\\\">National Highways Authority of\\nIndia Act, 1988</a> so as to provide that the National\\nHighway Authority of India may seek the participation of\\nthe private sector in respect of the highways vested in\\nthe Authority.\\n4. With a view to provide adequate capital and loans to\\nthe National Highways Authority of India by the Central\\nGovernment, it is proposed to make amendment in the\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/82478050/\\\" id=\\\"a_44\\\">National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988</a>.\\n5. With a view to achieve the above objectives and also\\nas both Houses of Parliament were not in session and\\nthe President was satisfied that circumstances existed\\nwhich rendered it necessary for him to take immediate\\n\\n                                                            12\\n\\f     action, the National Highways Laws (Amendment)\\n     Ordinance, 1997 was promulgated by the President on\\n     the 24th day of January, 1997.\\n     6. The Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance.”\\n\\n\\n8.     Pursuant to this, the amendments that were made to the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_45\\\">National Highways Act, 1956</a> with which we are directly concerned,\\n\\nare set out hereinbelow:\\n\\n     “3.

The\\n\\n                                                                   19\\n\\fimportant innovation made by the Amendment Act is that vesting is\\n\\nnot postponed to after an award is made by the Competent\\n\\nAuthority. Vesting takes place as soon as the <a href=\\\"/doc/2070234/\\\" id=\\\"a_68\\\">Section 3D</a> declaration\\n\\nis made. One other important difference between the <a href=\\\"/doc/41392/\\\" id=\\\"a_69\\\">Amendment\\n\\nAct and the Land Acquisition Act</a> is that determination of\\n\\ncompensation is to be made by the competent authority under the\\n\\nAmendment Act which, if not accepted by either party, is then to be\\n\\ndetermined by an Arbitrator to be appointed by the Central\\n\\nGovernment.    Such arbitrator’s Award is then subject to challenge\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/1306164/\\\" id=\\\"a_70\\\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>. Thus, delays in\\n\\nreferences made to District Judges and appeals therefrom to the\\n\\nHigh Court and Supreme Court have been obviated. <a href=\\\"/doc/68245331/\\\" id=\\\"a_71\\\">Section 3G(7)</a>\\n\\ndoes not provide for grant of solatium, and <a href=\\\"/doc/198845089/\\\" id=\\\"a_72\\\">Section 3H(5)</a> awards\\n\\ninterest at the rate of 9% on the excess amount determined by the\\n\\narbitrator over what is determined by the competent authority\\n\\nwithout the period of one year contained in the proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/1945807/\\\" id=\\\"a_73\\\">Section 28</a>\\n\\nof the Land Acquisition Act, after which interest is only awardable at\\n\\nthe rate of 15% per annum, if such payment is made beyond one\\n\\nyear.\\n\\n\\n10.     Before embarking on a discussion as to the constitutional\\n\\nvalidity of the Amendment Act, it is important to first understand\\n\\n\\n                                                                   20\\n\\fwhat is meant by the expression “solatium”. In Sunder vs Union of\\n\\nIndia (2001) 7 SCC 211, a bench of 5 judges of this Court laid down\\n\\nthe nature of solatium as follows:\\n\\n    “21. It is apposite in this context to point out that during\\n    the enquiry contemplated under <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_74\\\">Section 11</a> of the Act\\n    the Collector has to consider the objections which any\\n    person interested has stated pursuant to the notice\\n    given to him. It may be possible that a person so\\n    interested would advance objections for highlighting his\\n    disinclination to part with the land acquired on account of\\n    a variety of grounds, such as sentimental or religious or\\n    psychological or traditional etc. Section 24 emphasises\\n    that no amount on account of any disinclination of the\\n    person interested to part with the land shall be granted\\n    as compensation. That aspect is qualitatively different\\n    from the solatium which the legislature wanted to\\n    provide “in consideration of the compulsory nature of the\\n    acquisition”.\\n\\n    22. Compulsory nature of acquisition is to be\\n    distinguished from voluntary sale or transfer. In the latter,\\n    the landowner has the widest advantage in finding out a\\n    would-be buyer and in negotiating with him regarding the\\n    sale price. Even in such negotiations or haggling,\\n    normally no landowner would bargain for any amount in\\n    consideration of his disinclination to part with the land.\\n    The mere fact that he is negotiating for sale of the land\\n    would show that he is willing to part with the land. The\\n    owner is free to settle terms of transfer and choose the\\n    buyer as also to appoint the point of time when he would\\n    be receiving consideration and parting with his title and\\n    possession over the land. But in the compulsory\\n    acquisition the landowner is deprived of the right and\\n    opportunity to negotiate and bargain for the sale price. It\\n    depends on what the Collector or the court fixes as per\\n    the provisions of the Act. The solatium envisaged in sub-\\n                                                                    21\\n\\f      section (2) “in consideration of the compulsory nature of\\n      the acquisition” is thus not the same as damages on\\n      account of the disinclination to part with the land\\n      acquired.”\\n\\n\\n      Thus, the solatium that is paid to a landowner is on account of\\n\\nthe fact that a landowner, who may not be willing to part with his\\n\\nland, has now to do so, and that too at a value fixed legislatively and\\n\\nnot through negotiation, by which, arguably, such land owner would\\n\\nget the best price for the property to be sold.            Once this is\\n\\nunderstood in its correct perspective, it is clear that “solatium” is part\\n\\nand parcel of compensation that is payable for compulsory\\n\\nacquisition of land.\\n\\n\\n11.     As has been stated by us hereinabove, solatium and interest\\n\\nwere awarded to landowners for compulsory acquisition of their\\n\\nlands for the purpose of National Highways until the 1997\\n\\nAmendment Act. Interestingly, after the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_75\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> has\\n\\nbeen repealed and <a href=\\\"/doc/110685803/\\\" id=\\\"a_76\\\">The Right to Fair Compensation and\\n\\nTransparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement\\n\\nAct, 2013</a> has come into force, Section 105 of the said Act provides\\n\\nas under:\\n\\n      “105. Provisions of this Act not to apply in certain cases\\n      or to apply with certain modifications.- (1) Subject to\\n      sub-section (3), the provisions of this Act shall not apply\\n\\n                                                                       22\\n\\f      to the enactments relating to land acquisition specified in\\n      the Fourth Schedule.\\n\\n      (2) Subject to sub-section (2) of section 106, the Central\\n      Government may, by notification, omit or add to any of\\n      the enactments specified in the Fourth Schedule.\\n      (3) The Central Government shall, by notification, within\\n      one year from the date of commencement of this Act,\\n      direct that any of the provisions of this Act relating to the\\n      determination of compensation in accordance with the\\n      First Schedule and rehabilitation and resettlement\\n      specified in the Second and Third Schedules, being\\n      beneficial to the affected families, shall apply to the\\n      cases of land acquisition under the enactments specified\\n      in the Fourth Schedule or shall apply with such\\n      exceptions or modifications that do not reduce the\\n      compensation or dilute the provisions of this Act relating\\n      to compensation or rehabilitation and resettlement as\\n      may be specified in the notification, as the case may be.\\n\\n      (4) A copy of every notification proposed to be issued\\n      under sub-section (3), shall be laid in draft before each\\n      House of Parliament, while it is in session, for a total\\n      period of thirty days which may be comprised in one\\n      session or in two or more successive sessions, and if,\\n      before the expiry of the session immediately following\\n      the session or the successive sessions aforesaid, both\\n      Houses agree in disapproving the issue of the\\n      notification or both Houses agree in making any\\n      modification in the notification, the notification shall not\\n      be issued or, as the case may be, shall be issued only in\\n      such modified form as may be agreed upon by both the\\n      Houses of Parliament.”\\n\\n\\n12.     The First Schedule to the said Act provides that solatium\\n\\nequivalent to 100% of the market value multiplied by various factors,\\n\\n                                                                      23\\n\\fdepending on whether the land is situated in a rural or urban area,\\n\\nconstitutes minimum compensation package to be given to those\\n\\nwhose land is acquired. The Fourth Schedule to this Act, to be read\\n\\nalong with Section 105, expressly includes under Item 7, the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_77\\\">National Highways Act, 1956</a>. In Item 9, this Schedule also includes\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/434865/\\\" id=\\\"a_78\\\">The Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act,\\n\\n1952</a>.     By a notification dated 28 th August, 2015 issued under\\n\\nSection 105 read with Section 113 of the 2013 Act, it is provided\\n\\nthat the 2013 Act compensation provisions will apply to acquisitions\\n\\nthat take place under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_79\\\">National Highways Act</a>. The result is that\\n\\nboth before the 1997 Amendment Act and after the coming into\\n\\nforce of the 2013 Act, solatium and interest is payable to\\n\\nlandowners whose property is compulsorily acquired for purposes of\\n\\nNational Highways.     This is one other very important circumstance\\n\\nto be borne in mind when judging the constitutional validity of the\\n\\n1997 Amendment Act for the interregnum period from 1997 to 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_80\\\">Article 31-C\\n\\n\\n13.</a>      <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_81\\\">Articles 31-C</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_82\\\">39(b)</a> of the Constitution of India read as\\n\\nunder:\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                  24\\n\\f     “31C.

State of Maharashtra.        In the first of these\\n\\njudgments reported in (1996) 4 SCC 49, this Court has referred the\\n\\nmatter to five learned Judges on the vexed question as to whether\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_87\\\">Article 31-C</a> survived at all in view of the declaration contained in\\n\\nMinerva Mills v. Union of India 1981 (1) SCR 206 to the effect that\\n\\nthe amended <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_88\\\">Article 31-C</a> was constitutionally invalid.       As the\\n\\naforesaid declaration would not revive the original <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_89\\\">Article 31-C</a>, the\\n\\nArticle became a dead letter. When the same case travelled to five\\n\\nlearned Judges reported in (2001) 4 SCC 455, this Court was of the\\n\\nopinion that the views expressed in Sanjeev Coke (supra) require\\n\\nreconsideration in view of the fact that Sanjeev Coke (supra)\\n\\nadopted the reasoning of Krishna Iyer, J. in State of Karnataka vs\\n\\nShri Ranganatha Reddy (1977) 4 SCC 471 and not the reasoning of\\n\\nthe majority judgment of Untwalai, J. who stated that he must not be\\n\\nunderstood to agree with all that has been said by Krishna Iyer, J.\\n\\nin his judgment. The Court, therefore, referred the matter to seven\\n\\nlearned Judges. When the matter came up before the seven\\n\\n\\n                                                                  26\\n\\flearned Judges, reported in (2013) 7 SCC 522, this Court held that\\n\\nthe statement made in Sanjeev Coke (supra), followed by several\\n\\nother judgments, that the “material resources of the community”\\n\\nwould include privately owned resources, would be prima facie\\n\\nincorrect and hence the matter was referred to nine learned Judges\\n\\nof this Court, which reference is still pending. We have not deemed\\n\\nit necessary to refer this case to be tagged along with the reference\\n\\nto nine learned Judges, as we will assume for the purpose of this\\n\\ncase that <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_90\\\">Article 31-C</a>, as originally enacted, continues to exist and\\n\\nthat the “material resources of the community” would include private\\n\\nproperty as well.\\n\\n14.    Shri Divan next referred us to State of Tamil Nadu vs L. Abu\\n\\nKavur Bai (1984) 1 SCC 515, which held that the Tamil Nadu Stage\\n\\nCarriage and Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1973 was\\n\\nprotected by <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_91\\\">Article 31-C</a> of the Constitution of India. This was held\\n\\non the footing that a nationalisation measure would fall within <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_92\\\">Article\\n\\n39(b)</a> as the word “distribution” is a word of extremely wide import,\\n\\nwhich would include nationalisation of transport as a distributive\\n\\nprocess for the good of the community.          This situation is far\\n\\nremoved from the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_93\\\">Amendment Act to the National Highways Act</a> in\\n\\nthe present case, which is not a nationalisation measure at all, but is\\n\\na measure to speed up the acquisition process. Shri Divan then\\n\\n                                                                    27\\n\\frelied upon this Court’s judgment in Maharashtra SEB vs Thana\\n\\nElectric Supply Co. (1989) 3 SCC 616, in which the Indian Electricity\\n\\n(Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1976 was engrafted on to the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/261195/\\\" id=\\\"a_94\\\">Electricity Act, 1910</a>, the effect of which was to substitute market\\n\\nvalue of the undertaking that was compulsorily acquired, with the\\n\\nconcept of an “amount”, which was the book value of the\\n\\nundertaking at the time of its delivery. Even as per this Act, by\\n\\nvirtue of the compulsory acquisition of the undertaking, the licensee\\n\\nwas given a solatium of 10% of such book value. Importantly, this\\n\\nCourt, after holding that nationalisation would come within the\\n\\nexpression “distribution” for the purposes of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_95\\\">Article 39(b)</a>, engrafted\\n\\nanother test when legislation claims the protection of Article 31-C.\\n\\nThe Court held that the protection of <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_96\\\">Article 31-C</a> is accorded only to\\n\\nthose provisions which are basically and essentially necessary for\\n\\ngiving effect to the objects of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_97\\\">Article 39(b)</a> – See paragraph 43. This\\n\\ncase is again distinguishable for the same reason as pointed out\\n\\nqua State of Tamil Nadu v. L. Abu Kavur Bai (supra) as this is a\\n\\nnationalisation measure far removed from the object of the 1997\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_98\\\">Amendment Act to the National Highways Act</a>. It is interesting to\\n\\nnote that despite the fact that a challenge under <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_99\\\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/354224/\\\" id=\\\"a_100\\\">31</a>\\n\\nwere bound to fail in view of the protective umbrella of <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_101\\\">Article 31-C</a>,\\n\\nyet the Amendment Act had still provided for 10% solatium as the\\n\\n                                                                   28\\n\\flegislature had correctly appreciated that solatium is a part of\\n\\ncompensation given for the compulsory nature of acquisition of\\n\\nproperty.\\n\\n15.    Shri Divan then referred us to Tinsukhia Electric Supply Co.\\n\\nLtd. vs State of Assam (1989) 3 SCC 709, in which the <a href=\\\"/doc/50173174/\\\" id=\\\"a_102\\\">Indian\\n\\nElectricity (Assam Amendment) Act, 1973</a> and the Tinsukhia and\\n\\nDibrugarh Electric Supply Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, 1973 were\\n\\nchallenged. These being nationalisation measures, this Court held\\n\\nthat these enactments were entitled to the protection of Article 31-C.\\n\\nThis nationalisation statute, again, is very far removed from the\\n\\nAmendment Act, 1997 to the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_103\\\">National Highways Act</a>.\\n\\n\\n16.    It is well-settled that in order that a law avail of the protection\\n\\nof <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_104\\\">Article 31-C</a>, it is not necessary that any declaration be made in\\n\\nthat behalf. (See State of Maharashtra vs Basantibai Mohanlal\\n\\nKhetan (1986) 2 SCC 516 at 530). It is also important to remember\\n\\nthat in order that a law be shielded by <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_105\\\">Article 31-C</a>, the said law\\n\\nmust have a direct and rational nexus with the principles contained\\n\\nin <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_106\\\">Article 39(b).</a> (See Assam Sillimanite Ltd. vs Union of India 1991\\n\\nSupp 3 SCR 273 at 290)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                       29\\n\\f17.     An example of a law which claimed the benefit of <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_107\\\">Article 31-\\n\\nC</a>, but was denied such benefit is set out in Dr K. R. Lakshmanan vs\\n\\nState of Tamil Nadu (1996) 2 SCC 226 as follows:\\n\\n\\n      “44. The main object for which the Club was established\\n      is to carry on the business of race-club, in particular the\\n      running of horse-races, steeplechases or races of any\\n      other kind and for any kind of athletic sports and for\\n      playing their own games of cricket, bowls, golf, lawn\\n      tennis, polo or any other kind of games or amusement,\\n      recreation, sport or entertainment etc. In the earlier part\\n      of this judgment, we have noticed the working of the\\n      Club which shows that apart from 5% commission from\\n      the totalizator and the bookmakers no part of the betting-\\n      money comes to the Club. The Club does not own or\\n      control any material resources of the community which\\n      are to be distributed in terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_108\\\">Article 39(b)</a> of the\\n      Constitution of India. There are two aspects of the\\n      functioning of the Club. One is the betting by the punters\\n      at the totalizator and with the bookies. The Club does\\n      not earn any income from the betting-money except 5%\\n      commission. There is no question whatsoever of the\\n      Club owning or controlling the material resources of the\\n      community or in any manner contributing towards the\\n      operation of the economic system resulting in the\\n      concentration of wealth and means of production to the\\n      common detriment. The second aspect is the conduct of\\n\\n      horse-races by the Club. Horse-racing is a game of skill,\\n      the horse which wins the race is given a prize by the\\n      Club. It is a simple game of horse-racing where the\\n      winning horses are given prizes. Neither the “material\\n      resources of the community” nor “to subserve the\\n      common good” has any relevance to the twin functioning\\n      of the Club. Similarly, the operation of the Club has no\\n      relation or effect on the “operation of the economic\\n      system”. There is no question whatsoever of attracting\\n      the Directive Principles contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_109\\\">Article 39(b)</a> and (c)\\n      of the Constitution. The declaration in <a href=\\\"/doc/133170/\\\" id=\\\"a_110\\\">Section 2</a> of the\\n      Act and the recital containing aims and objectives totally\\n\\n                                                                    30\\n\\f    betray the scope and purpose of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_111\\\">Article 39(b)</a> and (c) of\\n    the Constitution. While <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_112\\\">Article 39(b)</a> refers to “material\\n    resources of the community”, the aims and objects of the\\n    Act refer to “the material resources of the Madras Race\\n    Club”. It is difficult to understand what exactly are the\\n    material resources of the race-club which are sought to\\n    be distributed so as to subserve the common good\\n    within the meaning of the Directive Principles. Equally,\\n    the reference to <a href=\\\"/doc/62166/\\\" id=\\\"a_113\\\">Article 39(c)</a> is wholly misplaced. While\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/62166/\\\" id=\\\"a_114\\\">Article 39(c)</a> relates to “the operation of the economic\\n    system … to the common detriment”, the aims and\\n    objectives of the Act refer to “the economic system of\\n    the Madras Race Club”. What is meant by the economic\\n    system of the Madras Race Club is not known. Even if it\\n    is assumed that betting by the punters at the totalizator\\n    and with the bookmakers is part of the economic system\\n    of the Madras Race Club, it has no relevance to the\\n    objectives specified in <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_115\\\">Article 39(b)</a> and (c). We are,\\n    therefore, of the view that reference to <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_116\\\">Article 39(b)</a> and\\n    (c) in the aims and objects and in <a href=\\\"/doc/133170/\\\" id=\\\"a_117\\\">Section 2</a> of the Act is\\n    nothing but a mechanical reproduction of constitutional\\n    provisions in a totally inappropriate context. There is no\\n    nexus so far as the provisions of the 1986 Act are\\n    concerned with the objectives contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_118\\\">Article 39(b)</a>\\n    and (c) of the Constitution. We, therefore, hold that the\\n    protection under <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_119\\\">Article 31-C</a> of the Constitution cannot\\n    be extended to the 1986 Act.”\\n\\n This is despite the fact that the impugned enactment, namely, the\\n\\nMadras Race Club (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Act,\\n\\n1986 contained a declaration that it was enacted to give effect to the\\n\\npolicy of the State under <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_120\\\">Article 39(b)</a> and (c).\\n\\n\\n18. When we examine the Objects and Reasons which led to the\\n\\n1997 amendment of the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_121\\\">National Highways Act</a>, we do not find\\n\\nmentioned therein any object relating to distribution of the material\\n\\n\\n                                                                   31\\n\\fresources of the community. The object of the Amendment Act has\\n\\nno relationship whatsoever to the Directive Principle contained in\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_122\\\">Article 39(b)</a>, inasmuch as its limited object is to expedite the\\n\\nprocess of land acquisition by avoiding inordinate delays therein.\\n\\nThe object of the Amendment Act was not to acquire land for the\\n\\npurpose of national highways as, pre-amendment, the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_123\\\">Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act</a> provided for this. The object of the Amendment Act\\n\\nwas fulfilled by providing a scheme different from that contained in\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_124\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, making it clear that the stage of offer of an\\n\\namount by way of compensation is removed altogether; vesting\\n\\ntakes place as soon as the <a href=\\\"/doc/2070234/\\\" id=\\\"a_125\\\">Section 3D</a> notification is issued; and\\n\\nmost importantly, the tardy Court process is replaced by arbitration.\\n\\nObviously, these objects have no direct and rational nexus with the\\n\\nDirective Principle contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_126\\\">Article 39(b).</a>       <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_127\\\">Article 31-C</a> is,\\n\\ntherefore, out of harm’s way. Even otherwise, on the assumption\\n\\nthat <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_128\\\">Article 31-C</a> is attracted to the facts of this case, yet, as was\\n\\nheld by Bhagwati, J. in Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India 1981\\n\\n(1) SCR 206,\\n\\n\\n    “…it is not every provision of a statute, which has been\\n    enacted with the dominant object of giving effect to a\\n    directive principle, that it entitled to protection, but only\\n    those provisions of the statute which are basically and\\n    essentially necessary for giving effect to the directive\\n\\n\\n                                                                    32\\n\\f    principle are protected under the amended Article 31-C”\\n    (at page 338-339)\\n\\n\\nThis passage was specifically referred to in Tinsukhia Electric\\n\\nSupply Co.

The idea of nationalisation of a material resource of\\n    the community cannot be divorced from the idea of\\n    distribution of that resource in the community in a\\n    manner which advances common good. The cognate\\n    and sequential question would be whether the provisions\\n    of the Amending Act, 1976, had a reasonable and direct\\n    nexus with the objects of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_129\\\">Article 39(b).</a> It is true, the\\n    protection of <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_130\\\">Article 31-C</a> is accorded only to those\\n    provisions      which    are basically  and     essentially\\n    necessary for giving effect to the objects of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_131\\\">Article 39(b).</a>\\n    The High Court from the trend of its reasoning in the\\n    judgment, appears to take the view that while the\\n    provision for the takeover in the principal Act might\\n    amount to a power to acquire, however, the objects of\\n    the <a href=\\\"/doc/1596533/\\\" id=\\\"a_132\\\">Amending Act</a> of 1976, which merely sought to beat\\n    down the price could not be said to be part of that power\\n    and was, therefore, incapable of establishing any nexus\\n    with <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_133\\\">Article 39(b).</a> There is, we say so with respect, a\\n    fallacy in this reasoning.”\\n\\n\\nThe test of Article 31-C’s protection being accorded only to those\\n\\nprovisions which are basically and essentially necessary for giving\\n\\neffect to the objects of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_134\\\">Article 39(b)</a> is lifted from Akadasi Padhan vs\\n\\nState of Orissa 1963 Supp. (2) SCR 691, where this Court held, with\\n\\nreference to <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_135\\\">Article 19(6)</a>, that qua laws passed creating a State\\n\\n                                                                    33\\n\\fmonopoly, it is only those essential and basic provisions which are\\n\\nprotected by the latter part of <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_136\\\">Article 19(6).</a>   This Court stated the\\n\\ntest thus:\\n\\n\\n    “17. In dealing with the question about the precise\\n    denotation of the clause “a law relating to”, it is\\n    necessary to bear in mind that this clause occurs in\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_137\\\">Article 19(6)</a> which is, in a sense, an exception to the\\n    main provision of <a href=\\\"/doc/935769/\\\" id=\\\"a_138\\\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> Laws protected by\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_139\\\">Article 19(6)</a> are regarded as valid even though they\\n    impinge upon the fundamental right guaranteed under\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/935769/\\\" id=\\\"a_140\\\">Article 19(1)(g).</a> That is the effect of the scheme\\n    contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/1142233/\\\" id=\\\"a_141\\\">Article 19(1)</a> read with Clauses (2) to (6) of\\n    the said Article. That being so, it would be unreasonable\\n    to place upon the relevant clause an unduly wide and\\n    liberal construction. “A law relating to” a State monopoly\\n    cannot, in the context, include all the provisions\\n    contained in the said law whether they have direct\\n    relation with the creation of the monopoly or not. In our\\n    opinion, the said expression should be construed to\\n    mean the law relating to the monopoly in its absolutely\\n    essential features. If a law is passed creating a State\\n    monopoly, the Court should enquire what are the\\n    provisions of the said law which are basically and\\n    essentially necessary for creating the State monopoly. It\\n    is only those essential and basic provisions which are\\n    protected by the latter part of <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_142\\\">Article 19(6).</a> If there are\\n    other provisions made by the Act which are subsidiary,\\n    incidental or helpful to the operation of the monopoly,\\n    they do not fall under the said part and their validity must\\n    be judged under the first part of <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_143\\\">Article 19(6).</a> In other\\n    words, the effect of the amendment made in <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_144\\\">Article 19(6)</a>\\n    is to protect the law relating to the creation of monopoly\\n    and that means that it is only the provisions of the law\\n    which are integrally and essentially connected with the\\n    creation of the monopoly that are protected. The rest of\\n    the provisions which may be incidental do not fall under\\n    the latter part of <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_145\\\">Article 19(6)</a> and would inevitably have\\n    to satisfy the test of the first part of <a href=\\\"/doc/626103/\\\" id=\\\"a_146\\\">Article 19(6)</a>.” (at\\n    page 707)\\n\\n                                                                   34\\n\\fEven if the Amendment Act, 1997 be regarded as an Act to carry out\\n\\nthe purposes of <a href=\\\"/doc/1200546/\\\" id=\\\"a_147\\\">Article 39(b)</a>, the object of the Amendment Act is not\\n\\nserved by removing solatium and interest from compensation to be\\n\\nawarded.    It is obvious, therefore, that the grant of compensation\\n\\nwithout solatium and interest is not basically and essentially\\n\\nnecessary to carry out the object of the Amendment Act, 1997, even\\n\\nif it is to be considered as an acquisition Act pure and simple, for the\\n\\nobject of the said Amendment Act as we have seen is to obviate\\n\\ndelays in the acquisition process of acquiring land for National\\n\\nHighways.       On application of this test as well, it is clear that the\\n\\ngrant of compensation without solatium and interest, not being\\n\\nbasically and essentially necessary to carry out the object of the\\n\\nAmendment Act, would not receive the protective umbrella of <a href=\\\"/doc/198382/\\\" id=\\\"a_148\\\">Article\\n\\n31-C</a> and, therefore, any infraction of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_149\\\">Article 14</a> can be inquired into\\n\\nby the Court.\\n\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_150\\\">Article 14 -</a> Discrimination\\n\\n\\n19.    The sheet anchor of the case of the Respondents is the\\n\\nConstitution Bench judgment in P.

The amending Act prescribes the principles\\n      for ascertaining the value of the property acquired. It\\n      was passed to amend the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_153\\\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a>, in\\n      the State of Madras for the purpose of enabling the\\n      State to acquire lands for housing schemes. “Housing\\n      scheme” is defined to mean “any State Government\\n      scheme the purpose of which is increasing house\\n      accommodation” and under <a href=\\\"/doc/1163443/\\\" id=\\\"a_154\\\">Section 3</a> of the amending\\n      Act, Section 23 of the principal Act is made applicable to\\n      such acquisition with certain modifications. In Section 23\\n      of the principal Act, in sub-section (1) for clause first, the\\n      following clause is substituted:\\n\\n                “first, the market value of the land at the date of\\n                the publication of the notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/343012/\\\" id=\\\"a_155\\\">Section\\n                4</a>, sub-section (1) or an amount equal to the\\n                average market value of the land during the five\\n                years immediately preceding such date,\\n                whichever is less.”\\n\\n          After clause sixthly, the following clause was added:\\n\\n                “seventhly, the use to which the land was put at\\n                the date of the publication of the notification\\n                under <a href=\\\"/doc/343012/\\\" id=\\\"a_156\\\">Section 4</a>, sub-section (1).”\\n\\n\\n                                                                       36\\n\\f    Sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the principal Act was\\n    amended by substituting the words, in respect of\\n    solatium, “fifteen per centum” by the words “five per\\n    centum”. In Section 24 of the principal Act after the\\n    clause seventhly the following clause was added:\\n\\n             “eighthly, any increase to the value of the land\\n             acquired by reason of its suitability or\\n             adaptability for any use other than the use to\\n             which the land was put at the date of the\\n             publication of the notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/343012/\\\" id=\\\"a_157\\\">Section 4</a>,\\n             sub-section (1).”\\n\\n    Under <a href=\\\"/doc/343012/\\\" id=\\\"a_158\\\">Section 4</a> of the amending Act, the provisions of\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/1163443/\\\" id=\\\"a_159\\\">Section 3</a> thereof shall apply to every case in which\\n    proceedings      have     been    started     before    the\\n    commencement of the said Act and are pending. The\\n    result of the amending Act is that if the State\\n    Government acquires a land for a housing purpose, the\\n    claimant gets only the value of the land at the date of the\\n    publication of the notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/343012/\\\" id=\\\"a_160\\\">Section 4(1)</a> of the\\n    principal Act or an amount equal to the average market\\n    value of the land during the five years immediately\\n    preceding such date, whichever is less. He will get a\\n    solatium of only 5 per centum of such value instead of\\n    15 per centum under the principal Act. He will not get\\n    any compensation by reason of the suitability of the land\\n    for any use other than the use for which it was put on the\\n    date of publication of the notification.” (at page 629 &amp;\\n    630)\\n\\n\\n      A challenge made to the said Amendment Act on the ground\\n\\nthat it is hit by <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_161\\\">Article 14</a> succeeded, the Court holding:\\n\\n\\n    “Now what are the differences between persons owning\\n    lands in the Madras city or between the lands acquired\\n    which have a reasonable relation to the said object. It is\\n    suggested that the differences between people owning\\n    lands rested on the extent, quality and the suitability of\\n    the lands acquired for the said object. The differences\\n\\n                                                                  37\\n\\fbased upon the said criteria have no relevance to the\\nobject of the <a href=\\\"/doc/1596533/\\\" id=\\\"a_162\\\">Amending Act</a>. To illustrate: the extent of\\nthe land depends upon the magnitude of the scheme\\nundertaken by the State. A large extent of land may be\\nacquired for a university or for a network of hospitals\\nunder the provisions of the principal Act and also for a\\nhousing scheme under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1596533/\\\" id=\\\"a_163\\\">Amending Act</a>. So too, if the\\nhousing scheme is a limited one, the land acquired may\\nnot be as big as that required for a big university. If\\nwaste land is good for a housing scheme under the\\namending Act, it will equally be suitable for a hospital or\\na school for which the said land may be acquired under\\nthe principal Act. Nor the financial position or the number\\nof persons owning the land has any relevance, for in\\nboth the cases land can be acquired from rich or poor,\\nfrom one individual or from a number of persons. Out of\\nadjacent lands of the same quality and value, one may\\nbe acquired for a housing scheme under the amending\\nAct and the other for a hospital under the principal Act;\\nout of two adjacent plots belonging to the same\\nindividual and of the same quality and value, one may\\nbe acquired under the principal Act and the other under\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/1596533/\\\" id=\\\"a_164\\\">Amending Act</a>. From whatever aspect the matter is\\nlooked at, the alleged differences have no reasonable\\nrelation to the object sought to be achieved. It is said\\nthat the object of the amending Act in itself may project\\nthe differences in the lands sought to be acquired under\\nthe two Acts. This argument puts the cart before the\\nhorse. It is one thing to say that the existing differences\\nbetween persons and properties have a reasonable\\nrelation to the object sought to be achieved and it is\\ntotally a different thing to say that the object of the Act\\nitself created the differences. Assuming that the said\\nproposition is sound, we cannot discover any differences\\nin the people owning lands or in the lands on the basis\\nof the object. The object is to acquire lands for housing\\nschemes at a low price. For achieving that object, any\\nland falling in any of the said categories can be acquired\\nunder the amending Act. So too, for a public purpose\\nany such land can be acquired under the principal Act.\\nWe, therefore, hold that discrimination is writ large on\\nthe amending Act and it cannot be sustained on the\\nprinciple of reasonable classification. We, therefore, hold\\n\\n                                                              38\\n\\f      that the amending Act clearly infringes <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_165\\\">Article 14</a> of the\\n      Constitution and is void.” (at page 634 &amp; 635)\\n\\n                                            (Emphasis supplied)\\n\\n\\n\\n21.     In Nagpur Improvement Trust (supra), this Court referred to\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/178029230/\\\" id=\\\"a_166\\\">Nagpur Improvement Trust Act</a>, under which lands were to be\\n\\nacquired with reference to the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_167\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, as modified.\\n\\nWe are concerned in this case with the modification that has to do\\n\\nwith acquisition for the purposes of the Improvement Act, which did\\n\\nnot provide for solatium of 15% that would have been obtained\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_168\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>. A Seven-Judge Bench of this Court\\n\\nexamined the matter in some detail, and followed P. Vajravelu\\n\\nMudaliar (supra) together with another judgment, Balammal vs\\n\\nState of Madras (1969) 1 SCR 90. The Court held:\\n\\n\\n      “27. What can be reasonable classification for the\\n      purpose of determining compensation if the object of the\\n      legislation is to compulsorily acquire land for public\\n      purposes?\\n\\n      28. It would not be disputed that different principles of\\n      compensation cannot be formulated for lands acquired\\n      on the basis that the owner is old or young, healthy or ill,\\n      tall or short, or whether the owner has inherited the\\n      property or built it with his own efforts, or whether the\\n      owner is politician or an advocate. Why is this sort of\\n      classification not sustainable? Because the object being\\n      to compulsorily acquire for a public purpose, the object\\n      is equally achieved whether the land belongs to one type\\n      of owner or another type.\\n\\n\\n                                                                     39\\n\\f      29. Can classification be made on the basis of the public\\n      purpose for the purpose of compensation for which land\\n      is acquired? In other words can the Legislature lay down\\n      different principles of compensation for lands acquired\\n      say for a hospital or a school or a Government building?\\n      Can the Legislature say that for a hospital land will be\\n      acquired at 50% of the market value, for a school at 60%\\n      of the value and for a Government building at 70% of the\\n      market value? All three objects are public purposes and\\n      as far as the owner is concerned it does not matter to\\n      him whether it is one public purpose or the other. <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_169\\\">Article\\n      14</a> confers an individual right and in order to justify a\\n      classification there should be something which justifies a\\n      different treatment to this individual right. It seems to us\\n      that ordinarily a classification based on the public\\n      purpose is not permissible under <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_170\\\">Article 14</a> for the\\n      purpose of determining compensation. The position is\\n      different when the owner of the land himself is the\\n      recipient of benefits from an improvement scheme, and\\n      the benefit to him is taken into consideration in fixing\\n      compensation. Can classification be made on the basis\\n      of the authority acquiring the land? In other words can\\n      different principles of compensation be laid if the land is\\n      acquired for or by an Improvement Trust or Municipal\\n      Corporation or the Government? It seems to us that the\\n      answer is in the negative because as far as the owner is\\n      concerned it does not matter to him whether the land is\\n      acquired by one authority or the other.\\n\\n      30. It is equally immaterial whether it is one Acquisition\\n      Act or another Acquisition Act under which the land is\\n      acquired. If the existence of two Acts could enable the\\n      State to give one owner different treatment from another\\n      equally situated the owner who is discriminated against,\\n      can claim the protection of Article 14.”\\n\\n\\n\\n22.

Vajravelu    Mudaliar    (supra)    and   Nagpur\\n\\nImprovement Trust (supra) clinch the issue in favour of the\\n\\nRespondents, as has been correctly held by the Punjab and\\n\\n\\n                                                                     40\\n\\fHaryana High Court in M/s Golden Iron and Steel Forging (supra).\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it is important to note that, as has been seen\\n\\nhereinabove, the object of the 1997 Amendment was to speed up\\n\\nthe process of acquiring lands for National Highways. This object\\n\\nhas been achieved in the manner set out hereinabove.        It will be\\n\\nnoticed that the awarding of solatium and interest has nothing to do\\n\\nwith achieving this object, as it is nobody’s case that land\\n\\nacquisition for the purpose of national highways slows down as a\\n\\nresult of award of solatium and interest. Thus, a classification made\\n\\nbetween different sets of landowners whose lands happen to be\\n\\nacquired for the purpose of National Highways and landowners\\n\\nwhose lands are acquired for other public purposes has no rational\\n\\nrelation to the object sought to be achieved by the Amendment Act,\\n\\ni.e. speedy acquisition of lands for the purpose of National\\n\\nHighways. On this ground alone, the Amendment Act falls foul of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_171\\\">Article 14.</a>\\n\\n\\n23.    Even otherwise, in P. Vajravelu Mudaliar (supra), despite\\n\\nthe fact that the object of the Amendment Act was to acquire lands\\n\\nfor housing schemes at a low price, yet the Amendment Act was\\n\\nstruck down when it provided for solatium at the rate of 5% instead\\n\\nof 15%, that was provided in the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_172\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, the Court\\n\\n\\n                                                                   41\\n\\fholding that whether adjacent lands of the same quality and value\\n\\nare acquired for a housing scheme or some other public purpose\\n\\nsuch as a hospital is a differentiation between two sets of\\n\\nlandowners having no reasonable relation to the object sought to be\\n\\nachieved.   More pertinently, another example is given – out of two\\n\\nadjacent plots belonging to the same individual one may be\\n\\nacquired under the principal Act for a particular public purpose and\\n\\none acquired under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1596533/\\\" id=\\\"a_173\\\">Amending Act</a> for a housing scheme, which,\\n\\nwhen looked at from the point of view of the landowner, would be\\n\\ndiscriminatory, having no rational relation to the object sought to be\\n\\nachieved, which is compulsory acquisition of property for public\\n\\npurposes.\\n\\n\\n24. Nagpur Improvement Trust (supra) has clearly held that\\n\\nordinarily a classification based on public purpose is not permissible\\n\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_174\\\">Article 14</a> for the purpose of determining compensation. Also,\\n\\nin para 30, the Seven-Judge Bench unequivocally states that it is\\n\\nimmaterial whether it is one Acquisition Act or another Acquisition\\n\\nAct under which the land is acquired, as, if the existence of these\\n\\ntwo Acts would enable the State to give one owner different\\n\\ntreatment from another who is similarly situated, <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_175\\\">Article 14</a> would be\\n\\ninfracted. In the facts of these cases, it is clear that from the point\\n\\n\\n                                                                    42\\n\\fof view of the landowner it is immaterial that his land is acquired\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_176\\\">National Highways Act</a> and not the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_177\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>,\\n\\nas solatium cannot be denied on account of this fact alone.\\n\\n25.    A contention was taken by Shri Divan in that <a href=\\\"/doc/660119/\\\" id=\\\"a_178\\\">Article 31-A</a>\\n\\nsecond proviso would make it clear that compensation at a rate\\n\\nwhich shall not be less than the market value would be payable only\\n\\nin the circumstances mentioned therein and not otherwise. For this\\n\\nreason, the Nagpur Improvement Trust case is distinguishable, as\\n\\none of the instances given therein is that it would not be possible to\\n\\ndiscriminate between landowners who are similarly situate by giving\\n\\none landowner compensation at let us say 60% of the market value\\n\\nand the other owner 100% of the market value.\\n\\n26.    The Nagpur Improvement Trust case has to be read as a\\n\\nwhole. Merely emphasising one example from the passages that\\n\\nhave been extracted above (supra) will not make the ratio of the\\n\\nsaid judgment inapplicable.    Besides, the second proviso to <a href=\\\"/doc/660119/\\\" id=\\\"a_179\\\">Article\\n\\n31-A</a> deals with persons whose lands are acquired when such\\n\\nperson is cultivating the same personally. The reason for awarding\\n\\ncompensation at a rate which is not less than market value is in\\n\\norder that a farmer, who is cultivating the land personally, gets other\\n\\nland of equivalent value, which he can then cultivate personally. As\\n\\nsuch farmer is at the centre of agrarian reform legislation, such\\n\\n                                                                    43\\n\\flegislation would be turned on its head if lands were to be acquired\\n\\nwithout adequately compensating him instead of from absentee\\n\\nlandlords whose lands are then to be given to the landless and to\\n\\nsuch persons if they personally cultivate lands less than the ceiling\\n\\narea under State Agricultural Ceiling Acts.       We think that any\\n\\nreference to the second proviso of <a href=\\\"/doc/660119/\\\" id=\\\"a_180\\\">Article 31-A</a> is wholly irrelevant to\\n\\nthe question before us and cannot under any circumstance be used\\n\\nin order to distinguish a judgment which otherwise applies on all\\n\\nfours.\\n\\n\\n27.      However, it was argued that a line of judgments have\\n\\ndistinguished   P.   Vajravelu   Mudaliar     (supra)   and   Nagpur\\n\\nImprovement Trust (supra) and that this line of judgments should\\n\\nbe followed in preference to the aforesaid two judgments.\\n\\n\\n28.      In Union of India vs Hari Krishnan Khosla 1993 Supp (2)\\n\\nSCC 149, this Court upheld the <a href=\\\"/doc/434865/\\\" id=\\\"a_181\\\">Requisitioning and Acquisition of\\n\\nImmovable Property Act, 1952</a> and stated that non-grant of solatium\\n\\nand interest which were otherwise grantable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_182\\\">Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act</a> would not render the 1952 Act constitutionally infirm.\\n\\nThe Court undertook a minute distinction between the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_183\\\">Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act</a> on the one hand and the 1952 Act on the other.\\n\\nThus, the Court stated:\\n\\n                                                                    44\\n\\f“43. Coming to dissimilarities, in the case of requisition,\\none of the important rights in the bundle of rights\\nemanating from ownership, namely, the right to\\npossession and enjoyment has been deprived of, when\\nthe property was requisitioned. It is minus that right for\\nwhich, as stated above, the compensation is provided\\nunder Section 8(2), the remaining rights come to be\\nacquired.\\n\\n44. In contradistinction under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_184\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>,\\nas stated above, the sum total of the rights, namely, the\\nownership itself comes to be acquired. We may usefully\\nquote from Salmond on Jurisprudence (1966) 12th Edn.,\\nChapter 8 at pages 246-247:\\n\\n       “Ownership denotes the relation between a\\n  person and an object forming the subject-matter of his\\n  ownership. It consists in a complex of rights, all of\\n  which are rights in rem, being good against all the\\n  world and not merely against specific persons.\\n  Though in certain situations some of these rights may\\n  be absent, the normal case of ownership can be\\n  expected to exhibit the following incidents.\\n\\n  First, the owner will have a right to possess the thing\\n  which he owns….\\n\\n  Secondly, the owner normally has the right to use and\\n  enjoy the thing owned: the right to manage it, i.e., the\\n  right to decide how it shall be used; and the right to\\n  the income from it ….\\n\\n          *                 *               *\\n\\n  Fifthly, ownership has a residuary character. If, for\\n  example, a landowner gives a lease of his property\\n  to A, an easement to B and some other right such as\\n  a profit to C, his ownership now consists of the\\n  residual rights, i.e., the rights remaining when all\\n  these lesser rights have been given away ….”\\n\\n45. Then again, under the Act, the acquisition even\\nthough it is for a public purpose is restricted to the two\\nclauses of <a href=\\\"/doc/1829618/\\\" id=\\\"a_185\\\">Section 7(3)</a> of the Act to which we have\\n\\n\\n                                                              45\\n\\f      already made a reference. Thus two clauses of <a href=\\\"/doc/1829618/\\\" id=\\\"a_186\\\">Section\\n      7(3)</a> constitute statutory embargo.\\n\\n      46. <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_187\\\">Under the Land Acquisition Act</a>, the power of\\n      eminent domain could be exercised without any\\n      embargo so long as there is an underlying public\\n      purpose. In our considered view, these vital distinctions\\n      will have to be kept in mind while dealing with the\\n      question of violation of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_188\\\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. We\\n      may, at once, state, when examined in this light, the\\n      reasonings of the High Court to make out a case of\\n      discrimination, seem to be incorrect.\\n\\n      xxx xxx xxx\\n\\n      58. We are of the firm view that cases of acquisition of\\n      land stand on a different footing than those where such\\n      property is subject to a prior requisition before\\n      acquisition.\\n\\n      59. Therefore, the cases relating to acquisition\\n      like Vajravelu Mudaliar case [(1965) 1 SCR 614 : AIR\\n      1965 SC 1017], Balammal case [(1969) 1 SCR 90 : AIR\\n      1968 SC 1425], Nagpur Improvement Trust case [(1973)\\n      1 SCC 500] and Peter case [(1980) 3 SCC 554] are not\\n      helpful    in   deciding     the    point    in     issue\\n      here. Goverdhan v. Union of India (Civil Appeal No. 3058\\n      of 1983, allowed by this Court on January 31, 1983) no\\n      doubt was a case of acquisition under the <a href=\\\"/doc/4890801/\\\" id=\\\"a_189\\\">Defence of\\n      India Act, 1962</a> but it contains no discussion. It has\\n      already been noticed that the award of solatium is not a\\n      must in every case as laid down in Prakash Amichand\\n      Shah case [(1986) 1 SCC 581]”\\n\\n29.     Similarly, in Union of India vs Chajju Ram (2003) 5 SCC 568,\\n\\na case which arose under the <a href=\\\"/doc/166591641/\\\" id=\\\"a_190\\\">Defence of India Act, 1971</a>, this Court\\n\\nfollowed Hari Krishnan Khosla (supra), finding that the provisions\\n\\nof the <a href=\\\"/doc/4890801/\\\" id=\\\"a_191\\\">Defence of India Act</a> were in pari materia to those of the 1952\\n\\nAct. The Court, therefore, held:\\n\\n\\n                                                                    46\\n\\f“25. Here it is not a case where existence of the\\nAcquisition Act enables the State to give one owner\\ndifferent treatment from another equally situated owner\\non which ground <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_192\\\">Article 14</a> was sought to be invoked\\nin First Nagpur Improvement Trust case [(1973) 1 SCC\\n500]. The purposes for which the provisions of the said\\nAct can be invoked are absolutely different and distinct\\nfrom which the provision of the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_193\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> can\\nbe invoked for acquisition of land. In terms of the\\nprovisions of the said Act, the requisition of the land was\\nmade. During the period of requisition the owner of the\\nland is to be compensated therefor. Section 30 of the\\nsaid Act, as referred to hereinbefore, clearly postulates\\nthe circumstances which would be attracted for\\nacquisitioning of the requisitioned land.\\n\\n26. The purposes for which the requisitioning and\\nconsequent acquisition of land under the said Act can be\\nmade, are limited. Such acquisitions, inter alia, can be\\nmade only when works have been constructed during\\nthe period of requisition or where the costs to any\\nGovernment of restoring the property to its condition at\\nthe time of its requisition would be excessive having\\nregard to the value of the property at the relevant time.\\n\\n27. One of the principles for determination of the amount\\nof compensation for acquisition of land would be the\\nwillingness of an informed buyer to offer the price\\ntherefor. In terms of the provisions of the said Act\\nacquisition of the property would be in relation to the\\nproperty which has been under requisition during which\\nperiod the owner of the land would remain out of\\npossession. The Government during the period of\\nrequisition would be in possession and full enjoyment of\\nthe property.\\n\\n28. It is beyond any cavil that the price of the land which\\na willing and informed buyer would offer would be\\ndifferent in the cases where the owner is in possession\\nand enjoyment of the property and in the cases where\\nhe is not. The formulation of the criteria for payment of\\ncompensation in terms of <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_194\\\">Section 31</a> of the Act was\\nclearly made having regard to the said factor, which\\ncannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable.\\n                                                              47\\n\\f      Parliament while making the provisions for payment of\\n      compensation must have also taken into consideration\\n      the fact that the owner of the property would have\\n      received compensation for remaining out of possession\\n      during the period when the property was under\\n      acquisition.\\n\\n      29. The learned Attorney-General appears to be correct\\n      in his submission that the provision for grant of solatium\\n      was inserted in the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_195\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> by Parliament\\n      having regard to the fact that the amount of\\n      compensation awarded to the owner of the land is to be\\n      determined on the basis of the value thereof as on the\\n      date of issuance of the notification under <a href=\\\"/doc/343012/\\\" id=\\\"a_196\\\">Section 4</a> of\\n      the Act. It has been noticed that the process takes a long\\n      time. Taking into consideration the deficiencies in the\\n      <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_197\\\">Act, the Land Acquisition Act</a> was further amended in the\\n      year 1984. In terms of sub-section (2) of <a href=\\\"/doc/31609/\\\" id=\\\"a_198\\\">Section 23</a> of\\n      the Land Acquisition Act, therefore, solatium is paid in\\n      addition to the amount of market value of the land.\\n\\n      30. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the\\n      classification sought to be made for determination of the\\n      amount of compensation for acquisition of the land\\n      under the said Act vis-à-vis the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_199\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> is a\\n      reasonable and valid one. The said classification is\\n      founded on intelligible differentia and has a rational\\n      relation with the object sought to be achieved by the\\n      legislation in question.”\\n\\n\\n\\n30.     We may hasten to add that a Division Bench of this Court in\\n\\nH. V. Low and Company Private Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal\\n\\n(2016) 12 SCC 699 has found on a prima facie examination that the\\n\\ncase of Chajju Ram (supra) requires reconsideration.\\n\\n\\n31.     For our purposes, it is enough to state that the line of\\n\\njudgments under the 1952 <a href=\\\"/doc/166591641/\\\" id=\\\"a_200\\\">Act and the Defence of India Act, 1971</a>,\\n\\n                                                                   48\\n\\fwhich contained a two-step process, namely, requisition which may\\n\\nbe followed by acquisition, are wholly distinguishable for the\\n\\nreasons stated in those judgments. As was stated in Chajju Ram\\n\\n(supra), the object of a Requisition Act is completely different from\\n\\nan Acquisition Act. In a Requisition Act, private property is taken for\\n\\npublic purposes only temporarily – when the reason for requisition\\n\\nends, ordinarily the property is handed back to the owner. This\\n\\nbeing the case, in requisition statutes handing back of the property\\n\\nis the rule and acquisition of the property the exception, as property\\n\\ncan only be acquired for the two reasons set out in <a href=\\\"/doc/1789527/\\\" id=\\\"a_201\\\">Section 7</a> of the\\n\\n1952 Act and <a href=\\\"/doc/104906317/\\\" id=\\\"a_202\\\">Section 30</a> of the Defence of India Act, 1971. Also, as\\n\\nhas been pointed out in Hari Krishnan Khosla (supra), what gets\\n\\nacquired is only rights as to ownership, possession having been\\n\\ntaken over by requisition.     In addition, the owner has already\\n\\nreceived compensation for remaining out of possession during the\\n\\nperiod when the property is under requisition. For all these reasons,\\n\\nthe aforesaid judgments are wholly distinguishable from the\\n\\nacquisition measure in this case.\\n\\n\\n32.    The next judgment relied upon by the learned counsel on\\n\\nbehalf of the Appellants is Prakash Amichand Shah vs State of\\n\\nGujarat (1986) 1 SCC 581. This judgment contained a challenge to\\n\\n\\n                                                                    49\\n\\fthe <a href=\\\"/doc/185815831/\\\" id=\\\"a_203\\\">Bombay Town Planning Act</a>. The Nagpur Improvement Trust\\n\\n(supra) judgment was distinguished in this judgment by stating that\\n\\nthe scheme of the <a href=\\\"/doc/185815831/\\\" id=\\\"a_204\\\">Bombay Town Planning Act</a> is wholly different\\n\\nfrom the scheme of the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_205\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>. In particular, the Court\\n\\nheld:\\n\\n\\n    “34. … Under <a href=\\\"/doc/721282/\\\" id=\\\"a_206\\\">Section 53</a> of the Act all rights of the\\n    private owners in the original plots would determine and\\n    certain consequential rights in favour of the owners\\n    would arise therefrom. If in the scheme, reconstituted or\\n    final plots are allotted to them they become owners of\\n    such final plots subject to the rights settled by the Town\\n    Planning Officer in the final scheme. In some cases the\\n    original plot of an owner might completely be allotted to\\n    the local authority for a public purpose. Such private\\n    owner may be paid compensation or a reconstituted plot\\n    in some other place. It may be a smaller or a bigger plot.\\n    It may be that in some cases it may not be possible to\\n    allot a final plot at all. <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_207\\\">Sections 67</a> to <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_208\\\">71</a> of the Act\\n    provide for certain financial adjustments regarding\\n    payment of money to the local authority or to the owners\\n    of the original plots. The development and planning\\n    carried out under the Act is primarily for the benefit of\\n    public. The local authority is under an obligation to\\n    function according to the Act. The local authority has to\\n    bear a part of the expenses of development. It is in one\\n    sense a package deal. The proceedings relating to the\\n    scheme are not like acquisition proceedings under the\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_209\\\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a>. Nor are the provisions of the\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_210\\\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a> made applicable either\\n    without or with modifications as in the case of the\\n    <a href=\\\"/doc/178029230/\\\" id=\\\"a_211\\\">Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936</a>. We do not\\n    understand the decision in Nagpur Improvement Trust\\n    case [(1973) 1 SCC 500 : AIR 1973 SC 689 : (1973) 3\\n    SCR 39] as laying down generally that wherever land is\\n    taken away by the government under a separate statute\\n    compensation should be paid under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_212\\\">Land Acquisition\\n    Act, 1894</a> only and if there is any difference between the\\n\\n                                                                  50\\n\\f      compensation payable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_213\\\">Land Acquisition Act,\\n      1894</a> and the compensation payable under the statute\\n      concerned the acquisition under the statute would be\\n      discriminatory. That case is distinguishable from the\\n      present case. In State of Kerala v. T.M. Peter [(1980) 3\\n      SCC 554 : AIR 1980 SC 1438 : (1980) 3 SCR 290] also\\n      Section 34 of the Cochin Town Planning Act which came\\n      up for consideration was of the same pattern as the\\n      provision in the <a href=\\\"/doc/178029230/\\\" id=\\\"a_214\\\">Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936</a>\\n      and for that reason the court followed the decision in\\n      the Nagpur Improvement Trust case [(1973) 1 SCC 500 :\\n      AIR 1973 SC 689 : (1973) 3 SCR 39] . But in that\\n      decision itself the court observed at pp. 302 and 303\\n      thus: (SCC p. 564, para 21)\\n\\n        “We are not to be understood to mean that the rate of\\n        compensation may not vary or must be uniform in all\\n        cases. We need not investigate this question further\\n        as it does not arise here although we are clear in our\\n        mind that under given circumstances differentiation\\n        even in the scale of compensation may comfortably\\n        comport with <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_215\\\">Article 14.</a> No such circumstances are\\n        present here nor pressed.”\\n\\n\\n\\n33.     This judgment is again distinguishable in that it was found,\\n\\nhaving regard to the <a href=\\\"/doc/185815831/\\\" id=\\\"a_216\\\">Bombay Town Planning Act</a>, that the person\\n\\nfrom whom the land was expropriated gets a package deal in that\\n\\nhe may be allotted other lands in the final Town Planning Scheme,\\n\\napart from compensation that is payable. However, it is worthy of\\n\\ncomment that State of Kerala vs T. M. Peter (1980) 3 SCC 554,\\n\\nwhich was relied upon in this case, expressly followed Nagpur\\n\\nImprovement Trust (supra), holding:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                 51\\n\\f“20. Is it rational to pay different scales of compensation,\\nas pointed out by Sikri, C.J., in Nagpur Improvement\\nTrust case [Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao,\\n(1973) 1 SCC 500 : AIR 1973 SC 689 : (1973) 3 SCR\\n39], depending on whether you acquire for housing or\\nhospital, irrigation scheme or town improvement, school\\nbuilding or police station? The amount of compensation\\npayable has no bearing on this distinction, although it is\\nconceivable that classification for purposes of\\ncompensation may exist and in such cases the statute\\nmay be good. We are unable to discern any valid\\ndiscrimen in the <a href=\\\"/doc/12423575/\\\" id=\\\"a_217\\\">Town Planning Act</a> vis-a-vis the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_218\\\">Land\\nAcquisition Act</a> warranting a classification in the matter\\nof denial of solatium.\\n\\n21. We uphold the Act in other respects but not when it\\ndeals invidiously between two owners based on an\\nirrelevant criterion viz. the acquisition being for an\\nimprovement scheme. We are not to be understood to\\nmean that the rate of compensation may not vary or\\nmust be uniform in all cases. We need not investigate\\nthis question further as it does not arise here although\\nwe are clear in our minds that under given\\ncircumstances differentiation even in the scale of\\ncompensation may comfortably comport with <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_219\\\">Article 14.</a>\\nNo such circumstances are present here nor pressed.\\nIndeed, the State, realising the force of this facet of\\ndiscrimination, offered, expiratory fashion, both before\\nthe High Court and before us, to pay 15%, solatium to\\nobliterate the hostile distinction.\\n\\n22. The core question now arises. What is the effect\\neven if we read a discrimination design in <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_220\\\">Section 34</a>? Is\\nplastic surgery permissible or demolition of the section\\ninevitable? Assuming that there is an untenable\\ndiscrimination in the matter of compensation does the\\nwhole of <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_221\\\">Section 34</a> have to be liquidated or several\\nportions voided? In our opinion, scuttling the section, the\\ncourse the High Court has chosen, should be the last\\nstep. The court uses its writ power with a constructive\\ndesign, an affirmative slant and a sustaining bent. Even\\nwhen by compulsions of inseverability, a destructive\\nstroke becomes necessary the court minimises the injury\\n\\n                                                               52\\n\\fby an intelligent containment. Law keeps alive and\\n“operation pull down” is de mode. Viewed from this\\nperspective, so far as we are able to see, the only\\ndiscriminatory factor as between <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_222\\\">Section 34</a> of the Act\\nand <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_223\\\">Section 25</a> of the Land Acquisition Act vis-à-vis\\nquantification of compensation is the nonpayment of\\nsolatium in the former case because of the provision in\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_224\\\">Section 34(1)</a> that <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_225\\\">Section 25</a> of the Land Acquisition Act\\nshall have no application. Thus, to achieve the virtue of\\nequality and to eliminate the vice of inequality what is\\nneeded is the obliteration of <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_226\\\">Section 25</a> of the Land\\nAcquisition Act from <a href=\\\"/doc/69386745/\\\" id=\\\"a_227\\\">Section 34(1)</a> of the Town Planning\\nAct. The whole of <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_228\\\">Section 34(1)</a> does not have to be\\nstruck down. Once we exclude the discriminatory and,\\ntherefore, void part in <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_229\\\">Section 34(1)</a> of the Act, equality is\\nrestored. The owner will then be entitled to the same\\ncompensation, including solatium, that he may be\\neligible for under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_230\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>. What is\\nrendered void by <a href=\\\"/doc/134715/\\\" id=\\\"a_231\\\">Article 13</a> is only “to the extent of the\\ncontravention” of <a href=\\\"/doc/367586/\\\" id=\\\"a_232\\\">Article 14.</a> The lancet of the court may\\nremove the offending words and restore to constitutional\\nhealth the rest of the provision.\\n\\n23. We hold that the exclusion of <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_233\\\">Section 25</a> of the Land\\nAcquisition Act from <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_234\\\">Section 34</a> of the Act is\\nunconstitutional but it is severable and we sever it. The\\nnecessary consequence is that <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_235\\\">Section 34(1)</a> will be\\nread omitting the words “and <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_236\\\">Section 25</a>”. What follows\\nthen? <a href=\\\"/doc/1936195/\\\" id=\\\"a_237\\\">Section 32</a> obligates the State to act under the\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_238\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> but we have struck down that part\\nwhich excludes <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_239\\\">Section 25</a>, of the Land Acquisition Act\\nand so, the “modification” no longer covers <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_240\\\">Section 25</a>. It\\ncontinues to apply to the acquisition of property under\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/12423575/\\\" id=\\\"a_241\\\">Town Planning Act</a>. <a href=\\\"/doc/779745/\\\" id=\\\"a_242\\\">Section 34(2)</a> provides for\\ncompensation exactly like <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_243\\\">Section 25(1)</a> of the Land\\nAcquisition Act and in the light of what we have just\\ndecided <a href=\\\"/doc/158228882/\\\" id=\\\"a_244\\\">Section 25(2)</a> will also apply and “in addition to\\nthe market value of the land as above provided, the\\ncourt shall in every case award a sum of fifteen per\\ncentum on such market value in consideration of the\\ncompulsory nature of the acquisition”.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                53\\n\\f34.    One more judgment needs to be referred to, namely, Girnar\\n\\nTraders (3) vs State of Maharashtra (2011) 3 SCC 1, which was\\n\\nrelied upon by Shri Divan to argue that, like <a href=\\\"/doc/185815831/\\\" id=\\\"a_245\\\">Chapter VII of the\\n\\nMaharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act</a>, the amendment to\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_246\\\">National Highways Act</a> is a complete self-contained code and\\n\\nmust, therefore, be followed on its own terms. This judgment dealt\\n\\nwith whether Section 11-A introduced by the 1984 amendment to\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_247\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> could be said to apply to acquisitions made\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/185815831/\\\" id=\\\"a_248\\\">Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act</a>. The answer to\\n\\nthis question was that Section 11-A could not be so applied as the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/185815831/\\\" id=\\\"a_249\\\">Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act</a> referred to the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_250\\\">Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act</a> as legislation by way of incorporation and not\\n\\nlegislation by way of reference.     In the present case, the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_251\\\">Land\\n\\nAcquisition Act</a>, by virtue of <a href=\\\"/doc/118663988/\\\" id=\\\"a_252\\\">Section 3J</a> of the National Highways Act,\\n\\ndoes not apply at all. The controversy in the present case does not,\\n\\nin any manner, involve whether the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_253\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> applies by\\n\\nway of incorporation or reference.     This case is also, therefore,\\n\\nwholly distinguishable. Further, the ‘self-contained code’ argument\\n\\nbased on this judgment cannot be used as a discriminatory tool to\\n\\ndeny benefits available to landowners merely because land has to\\n\\nbe acquired under a different Act, as has been held in Nagpur\\n\\nImprovement Trust (supra).\\n\\n                                                                   54\\n\\f35.    Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on\\n\\nbehalf of the Union of India and NHAI, has stated that under <a href=\\\"/doc/9286604/\\\" id=\\\"a_254\\\">Section\\n\\n3G(2)</a> of the National Highways Act, where the right of user or any\\n\\nright in the nature of an easement on land is acquired under the Act,\\n\\nthere shall be paid to the owner and any other person whose right is\\n\\nso affected, an amount calculated at 10% of the amount that is\\n\\ndetermined as payable by the order of the competent authority.\\n\\nAccording to the learned Senior Advocate, this amount is not\\n\\npayable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_255\\\">Land Acquisition Act, 1894</a>, and that this being\\n\\nthe case, it is clear that what is given by way of compensation under\\n\\nthe <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_256\\\">National Highways Act</a> being more than what is given under the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_257\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> in certain respects, the Scheme of the Acts,\\n\\ntherefore, being different, the non-giving of solatium and interest\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_258\\\">National Highways Act</a> is justified.       Even otherwise,\\n\\npersons should not be given compensation under Section 3G(2) as\\n\\na matter of course, but would have to submit proof that a right of\\n\\neasement or a right of user has been acquired for which\\n\\ncompensation ought to be paid. Shri Amit Sibal, learned Senior\\n\\nAdvocate, on the other hand, has argued, referring to <a href=\\\"/doc/23306028/\\\" id=\\\"a_259\\\">Sections 3(b)</a>,\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1990166/\\\" id=\\\"a_260\\\">9</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/624098/\\\" id=\\\"a_261\\\">31(1)</a> of the Land Acquisition Act that easementary rights are\\n\\ncompensated even under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_262\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> and in point of\\n\\nfact the sum of 10% payable under Section 3G(2) of the National\\n\\n                                                                  55\\n\\f<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_263\\\">Highways Act</a> is really in the nature of a cap beyond which no\\n\\nfurther compensation can be granted.      Even otherwise, according\\n\\nto the learned Senior Advocate, granting of compensation under\\n\\nSection 3G(2) would have no bearing on interest and solatium that\\n\\nis payable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_264\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> and not under the\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_265\\\">National Highways Act</a>.\\n\\n36.     Section 3G(2) makes it clear that rights of user and rights in\\n\\nthe    nature   of   easement    being   valuable   property     rights,\\n\\ncompensation must be payable therefor. It is obvious that there is\\n\\nno double payment to the owner on this score as the owner and/or\\n\\nany other person has to prove that a right in the nature of an\\n\\neasement has also been taken away. Obviously, the right of user\\n\\nbeing subsumed in acquisition of ownership, the owner cannot get a\\n\\ndouble benefit on this score.       The right of user is, therefore,\\n\\nreferable only to persons    other than the owner, who may have\\n\\ntenancy rights, and other rights of license on land which is acquired\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_266\\\">National Highways Act</a>.\\n\\n\\n\\n37.     Insofar as easementary rights under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_267\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>\\n\\nare concerned, three Sections are relevant and need to be quoted:\\n\\n\\n      “3. Definitions.— In this Act, unless there is something\\n      repugnant in the subject or context,—\\n\\n                                                                     56\\n\\fxxx xxx\\n\\n   (b) the expression “person interested” includes all\\npersons claiming an interest in compensation to be\\nmade on account of the acquisition of land under this\\nAct; and a person shall be deemed to be interested in\\nland if he is interested in an easement affecting the land;\\n\\nxxx xxx\\n\\n9. Notice to persons interested.— (1) The Collector shall\\nthen cause public notice to be given at convenient\\nplaces on or near the land to be taken, stating that the\\nGovernment intends to take possession of the land, and\\nthat claims to compensation for all interests in such land\\nmay be made to him.\\n\\n(2) Such notice shall state the particulars of the land so\\nneeded, and shall require all persons interested in the\\nland to appear personally or by agent before the\\nCollector at a time and place therein mentioned (such\\ntime not being earlier than fifteen days after the date of\\npublication of the notice), and to state the nature of their\\nrespective interests in the land and the amount and\\nparticulars of their claims to compensation for such\\ninterests, and their objections (if any) to the\\nmeasurements made under <a href=\\\"/doc/85884054/\\\" id=\\\"a_268\\\">section 8</a>. The Collector\\nmay in any case require such statement to be made in\\nwriting and signed by the party or his agent.\\n\\n(3) The Collector shall also serve notice to the same\\neffect on the occupier (if any) of such land and on all\\nsuch persons known or believed to be interested therein,\\nor to be entitled to act for persons so interested, as\\nreside or have agents authorised to receive service on\\ntheir behalf, within the revenue district in which the land\\nis situate.\\n\\n(4) In case any person so interested resides elsewhere,\\nand has no such agent the notice shall be sent to him by\\npost in a letter addressed to him at his last known\\nresidence, address or place of business and registered\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/21415956/\\\" id=\\\"a_269\\\">sections 28</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/39711725/\\\" id=\\\"a_270\\\">29</a> of the Indian Post Office Act,\\n1898 (6 of 1898).\\n\\n                                                               57\\n\\f    xxx xxx\\n\\n    31. Payment of compensation or deposit of same in\\n    Court.— (1) On making an award under <a href=\\\"/doc/291273/\\\" id=\\\"a_271\\\">section 11</a>, the\\n    Collector shall tender payment of the compensation\\n    awarded by him to the persons interested entitled\\n    thereto according to the award, and shall pay it to them\\n    unless prevented by some one or more of the\\n    contingencies mentioned in the next sub-section.\\n\\n    xxx xxx”\\n\\n\\n A reading of these Sections shows that a person who is interested\\n\\nin an easement affecting land can claim compensation therefor\\n\\nunder the aforesaid provisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_272\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>.    Under\\n\\nboth the Land Acquisition Act and the National Highways Act, such\\n\\nclaims have to be proved in accordance with law, the difference\\n\\nbeing that under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_273\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a> actuals are payable,\\n\\nwhereas under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_274\\\">National Highways Act</a>, a fixed amount of 10% of\\n\\nthe amount determined by the competent authority is payable. It is,\\n\\ntherefore, wholly incorrect to state that extra amounts are payable to\\n\\nthe owner under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_275\\\">National Highways Act</a>, which are not so\\n\\npayable under the <a href=\\\"/doc/7832/\\\" id=\\\"a_276\\\">Land Acquisition Act</a>.              Also, both Acts\\n\\ncontemplate    payment    of   compensation     to   persons   whose\\n\\neasementary rights have been affected by the acquisition. In any\\n\\nevent, this contention cannot possibly answer non-payment of\\n\\nsolatium and interest under the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_277\\\">National Highways Act</a>, which has\\n\\nbeen dealt with in extenso in this judgment.\\n                                                                   58\\n\\f38.     It is worthy of note that even in acquisitions that take place\\n\\nunder the <a href=\\\"/doc/1222415/\\\" id=\\\"a_278\\\">National Highways Act</a> and the 1952 Act, the notification\\n\\nof 2015 under the new Acquisition Act of 2013 makes solatium and\\n\\ninterest payable in cases covered by both Acts. In fact, with effect\\n\\nfrom 1st January, 2015, an Amendment Ordinance No.9 of 2014 was\\n\\npromulgated amending the 2013 Act.              <a href=\\\"/doc/742973/\\\" id=\\\"a_279\\\">Section 10</a> of the said\\n\\namendment Ordinance states as follows:\\n\\n\\n      “10.
