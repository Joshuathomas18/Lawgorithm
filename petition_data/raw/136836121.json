Pursuant to <a href=\\\"/doc/768139/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Article 342</a> of the Constitution of India, a list of\\n\\nScheduled Tribes was notified by the Constitution (Scheduled\\n\\nTribes) Order, 1950 (for short ‘the ST Order’). By an Act of\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">                                 2</span>\\n\\fParliament of 1976, the ST Order was amended. Part IX of the Third\\n\\nSchedule to the 1976 Act contains a list of notified Scheduled Tribes\\n\\nfor the State of Maharashtra. At Entry no.44 in the Maharashtra\\n\\nList, the following castes have been notified as Scheduled Tribes:­\\n\\n\\n      “Thakur, Thakar, Ka Thakur, Ka Thakar, Ma Thakur,\\n\\n      Ma Thakar”.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">2.    Various issues concerning the procedure to be followed for the\\n\\ndetermination of caste claims arose in a large number of cases. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"223323\\\" id=\\\"span_2\\\">In\\n\\nthe    case      of   <a href=\\\"/doc/223323/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Kumari   Madhuri   Patil   and    Another       v.\\n\\nAddl.Commissioner, Tribal Development &amp; Others1</a>, this Court\\n\\nnoted that it was necessary to streamline the procedure for issuance\\n\\nof social status certificates, their scrutiny and their approval. The\\n\\nneed to lay down procedural guidelines was felt as several cases\\n\\nwere noticed where candidates on the basis of false social status\\n\\ncertificates obtained admissions to educational institutions which\\n\\nnecessarily had the effect of depriving admissions to genuine\\n\\ncandidates belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes.\\n\\nThere was no law in force at that time laying down the procedure for\\n1 (1994) 6 SCC 241\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_3\\\">                                   3</span>\\n\\fthe verification of caste status.       Therefore, very exhaustive\\n\\nguidelines were <a href=\\\"/doc/223323/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">laid down in</a> paragraph 13 of <a href=\\\"/doc/223323/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">the said decision</a>. The\\n\\nrelevant part of Paragraph 13 of <a href=\\\"/doc/223323/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">the said decision</a> reads thus:</span>\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">          “13. The     admission      wrongly    gained    or\\n          appointment wrongly obtained on the basis of\\n          false social status certificate necessarily has the\\n          effect of depriving the genuine Scheduled Castes\\n          or Scheduled Tribes or OBC candidates as\\n          enjoined in the Constitution of the benefits\\n          conferred on them by the Constitution. The\\n          genuine candidates are also denied admission to\\n          educational institutions or appointments to office\\n          or posts under a State for want of social status\\n          certificate. The ineligible or spurious persons\\n          who falsely gained entry resort to dilatory tactics\\n          and create hurdles in completion of the inquiries\\n          by the Scrutiny Committee. It is true that the\\n          applications for admission to educational\\n          institutions are generally made by a parent, since\\n          on that date many a time the student may be a\\n          minor. It is the parent or the guardian who may\\n          play fraud claiming false status certificate. It is,\\n          therefore, necessary that the certificates issued\\n          are scrutinised at the earliest and with utmost\\n          expedition and promptitude. For that purpose,\\n          it is necessary to streamline the procedure for\\n          the issuance of social status certificates, their\\n          scrutiny and their approval, which may be the\\n          following:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">          1.

All the State Governments shall constitute a\\nCommittee of three officers, namely, (I) an\\nAdditional or Joint Secretary or any officer high­\\ner in rank of the Director of the department\\nconcerned, (II) the Director, Social Welfare/Tribal\\nWelfare/Backward Class Welfare, as the case\\nmay be, and (III) in the case of Scheduled Castes\\nanother officer who has intimate knowledge in\\nthe verification and issuance of the social status\\ncertificates. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes,\\nthe Research Officer who has intimate knowledge\\nin identifying the tribes, tribal communities,\\nparts of or groups of tribes or tribal communities.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_5\\\">5. Each Directorate should constitute a\\nVigilance Cell consisting of Senior Deputy\\nSuperintendent of Police in over­all charge\\nand such number of Police Inspectors to\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">                        5</span>\\n\\finvestigate into the social status claims. The\\nInspector would go to the local place of residence\\nand original place from which the candidate hails\\nand usually resides or in case of migration to the\\ntown or city, the place from which he originally\\nhailed from. The vigilance officer should\\npersonally verify and collect all the facts of the\\nsocial status claimed by the candidate or the\\nparent or guardian, as the case may be. He\\nshould also examine the school records, birth\\nregistration, if any. He should also examine the\\nparent, guardian or the candidate in relation\\nto their caste etc. or such other persons who\\nhave knowledge of the social status of the\\ncandidate and then submit a report to the\\nDirectorate together with all particulars as\\nenvisaged in the pro forma, in particular, of\\nthe Scheduled Tribes relating to their peculiar\\nanthropological and ethnological traits, deity,\\nrituals, customs, mode of marriage, death\\nceremonies, method of burial of dead bodies\\netc. by the castes or tribes or tribal\\ncommunities concerned etc.\\n\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_6\\\">6. The Director concerned, on receipt of the\\nreport from the vigilance officer if he found the\\nclaim for social status to be “not genuine” or\\n‘doubtful’ or spurious or falsely or wrongly\\nclaimed, the Director concerned should issue\\nshow­cause notice supplying a copy of the report\\nof the vigilance officer to the candidate by a\\nregistered post with acknowledgement due or\\nthrough the head of the educational institution\\nconcerned in which the candidate is studying or\\nemployed. The notice should indicate that the\\nrepresentation or reply, if any, would be made\\nwithin two weeks from the date of the receipt of\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">                       6</span>\\n\\fthe notice and in no case on request not more\\nthan 30 days from the date of the receipt of the\\nnotice. In case, the candidate seeks for an\\nopportunity of hearing and claims an inquiry to\\nbe made in that behalf, the Director on receipt of\\nsuch representation/reply shall convene the\\ncommittee and the Joint/Additional Secretary as\\nChairperson      who     shall   give   reasonable\\nopportunity to the candidate/parent/guardian to\\nadduce all evidence in support of their claim. A\\npublic notice by beat of drum or any other\\nconvenient mode may be published in the village\\nor locality and if any person or association\\nopposes such a claim, an opportunity to adduce\\nevidence may be given to him/it. After giving\\nsuch opportunity either in person or through\\ncounsel, the Committee may make such inquiry\\nas it deems expedient and consider the claims\\nvis­à­vis the objections raised by the candidate or\\nopponent and pass an appropriate order with\\nbrief reasons in support thereof.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_7\\\">7. In case the report is in favour of the candidate\\nand found to be genuine and true, no further\\naction need be taken except where the report or\\nthe particulars given are procured or found to be\\nfalse or fraudulently obtained and in the latter\\nevent the same procedure as is envisaged in para\\n6 be followed.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_8\\\">8. Notice contemplated in para 6 should be\\nissued to the parents/guardian also in case\\ncandidate is minor to appear before the\\nCommittee with all evidence in his or their\\nsupport of the claim for the social status\\ncertificates.\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_9\\\">9. ……………….\\n</blockquote><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">                        7</span>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_10\\\">\\f          10. ……………..\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_11\\\">          11.

The aforesaid guidelines were formulated obviously in the\\n\\nexercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\\\"/doc/500307/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution as this\\n\\nCourt found that there was no legislation operating in the field. So\\n\\nfar as the State of Maharashtra is concerned, with effect from 18 th\\n\\nOctober 2001, the Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled\\n\\nTribes, De­notified Tribes, (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other\\n\\nBackward Classes and Special Backward Category (Regulation of\\n\\nIssuance and Verification of) Caste Certificate Act, 2000 (for short\\n\\n‘the 2000 Act’) was brought into force. The 2000 Act contains a very\\n\\nelaborate mechanism for regulating the issue and verification of\\n\\ncaste certificates to persons belonging to various categories of\\n\\nbackward classes. A two­level mechanism was provided. The first\\n\\nlevel is of the Competent Authority issuing a caste certificate which\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">                                  8</span>\\n\\fis valid only subject to verification and grant of validity certificate by\\n\\nthe Scrutiny Committee constituted under the 2000 Act. Power is\\n\\nvested in the Scrutiny Committee constituted under Section 6 to\\n\\nverify the correctness of the caste certificates issued by the\\n\\nCompetent Authority. <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"223323\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">Section 9 confers powers on the Competent\\n\\nAuthority and the Scrutiny Committee of a civil court of summoning\\n\\nand enforcing the attendance of witnesses, requiring the discovery\\n\\nand inspection of documents, receiving evidence on affidavits,\\n\\nrequisitioning any public record or a copy thereof from any Court or\\n\\noffice and issuing Commissions for the examination of witnesses or\\n\\nproduction of documents. Rule­making power under the 2000 Act\\n\\nwas exercised by framing the Maharashtra Scheduled Tribes\\n\\n(Regulation of Issuance and verification of) Certificate Rules, 2003\\n\\n(for short “the ST Rules”).    Similarly, the Maharashtra Scheduled\\n\\nCastes, De­notified Tribes, (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other\\n\\nBackward Classes and Special Backward Category (Regulation of\\n\\nIssuance and Verification of) Caste Certificate Rules, 2012 (for short\\n\\n‘the SC Rules’) were framed.            Elaborate provisions for the\\n\\nconstitution of the Scrutiny Committee as well as the procedure to\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_10\\\">                                    9</span>\\n\\fbe followed by the Competent Authority, and the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee have been <a href=\\\"/doc/223323/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">laid down by</a> the Rules applicable to both\\n\\ncategories. Rule 10 and Rule 12 of the ST Rules provide for the\\n\\nconstitution of Vigilance Cells to assist the Scrutiny Committees for\\n\\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively for conducting\\n\\nan enquiry. The Vigilance Cell established under ST Rules consists\\n\\nof a Senior Deputy Superintendent of Police, Police Inspectors,\\n\\nPolice Constables to assist the Police Inspector and a Research\\n\\nOfficer. The SC Rules specifically provide for the Vigilance Cell to\\n\\nconduct affinity test. There is some controversy about whether the\\n\\nvigilance cell constituted under the ST Rules has a power to conduct\\n\\naffinity test. We are dealing with the said issue. The Vigilance Cell\\n\\nis required to enquire about anthropological and ethnological traits,\\n\\ndeities, rituals, customs, mode of marriage, death ceremonies,\\n\\nmethod of disposal of dead bodies etc. by the castes or tribes or\\n\\ntribal communities concerned.      As a part of the affinity test, a\\n\\ncandidate who has obtained a caste certificate from Competent\\n\\nAuthority is tested to ascertain whether he has knowledge about the\\n\\naforesaid factors pertaining to the particular caste/tribe.</span>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_11\\\">                                  10</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">\\fCONTROVERSY\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"11248718\\\" id=\\\"span_12\\\">4.     By the order dated 24th March 2022, the present group of\\n\\ncases was referred to a larger Bench. The challenge in the lead case\\n\\n(Civil Appeal No. 2502 of 2022) is to a decision of a Full Bench of\\n\\nthe Bombay High Court in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/11248718/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Shilpa Vishnu Thakur v.\\n\\nState of Maharashtra2</a>. The Full Bench of the Bombay High Court\\n\\nhas interpreted the provisions of the 2000 Act as well as ST Rules.\\n\\nThe     impugned        judgment   discusses   and   lays   down   various\\n\\nprocedural aspects to be followed by the Scrutiny Committee. The\\n\\nFull Bench of the Bombay High Court has held that the affinity test\\n\\nis an integral part of the determination of the correctness of the\\n\\ncaste claim. In the order dated 24th March 2022, a Bench of this\\n\\nCourt noted that there was a conflict of views expressed in two\\n\\ndecisions of coordinate Benches of this Court.</span> <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"171802447\\\" id=\\\"span_13\\\">The first case is of\\n\\nVijakumar v.

In paragraph 9 of the decision in the case of\\n\\n2 2009 (3) Mh.LJ (F.B) 995\\n3 (2010) 14 SCC 489\\n4 (2012) 1 SCC 113\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_14\\\">                                      11</span>\\n\\fVijakumar3, this Court held that if a candidate fails the affinity test\\n\\nat any stage, a caste validity certificate cannot be granted to him. In\\n\\nthe case of Anand4, it was held that the affinity test is not the only\\n\\ncriteria for deciding a caste claim based on a caste certificate issued\\n\\nby a Competent Authority. It was held that it can be used to\\n\\ncorroborate the documentary evidence. The question to be decided\\n\\nis whether paramount importance should be given to the affinity\\n\\ntest while adjudicating upon a caste claim on the basis of a caste\\n\\ncertificate issued by a Competent Authority.     In other words, the\\n\\nquestion is whether the affinity test is a litmus test for deciding a\\n\\ncaste claim.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">\\nCONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">5.   Main submissions have been made on behalf of the appellants\\n\\nin Civil Appeal No. 2502 of 2022 by Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned\\n\\nsenior counsel.   He has taken us through the 2000 Act and ST\\n\\nRules. Relying upon the decision in the case of Kumari Madhuri\\n\\nPatil1, he urged that the documents which pertain to the pre­\\n\\nConstitution period have the greatest probative value. He submits\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_15\\\">                                  12</span>\\n\\fthat if such documents in support of caste claim are presented\\n\\nbefore the Scrutiny Committee, and if the same are found to be\\n\\nrelevant and genuine, there is no occasion for the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee to order an enquiry through Vigilance Cell. Similarly, if\\n\\nblood relatives of the person applying for verification before the\\n\\nCaste Scrutiny    Committee have been granted caste validity\\n\\ncertificates, no further enquiry by the Scrutiny Committee is called\\n\\nfor. In both cases, it is the duty of the Caste Scrutiny Committee to\\n\\nvalidate the caste certificate. He invited our attention to Rule 12 of\\n\\nthe ST Rules which lays down the procedure to be followed by the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee. He pointed out that sub­rule (2) provides that\\n\\nonly if Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied with the documentary\\n\\nevidence produced by the applicant, it can order enquiry through\\n\\nVigilance Cell. He pointed out that the question of the conduct of\\n\\nthe affinity test arises only after the case is forwarded to the\\n\\nVigilance Cell after the Scrutiny Committee comes to the conclusion\\n\\nthat the documents produced by the applicant are not sufficient to\\n\\nprove the caste claim. He submitted that the Scrutiny Committee\\n\\ncould not mechanically refer a case to the Vigilance Cell without\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_16\\\">                                  13</span>\\n\\frecording      satisfaction   that   the    documents   produced   by   the\\n\\napplicant were not sufficient to validate the caste claim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"156136902\\\" id=\\\"span_17\\\">6.    He relied upon a decision of the Bombay High Court in the\\n\\ncase of Apoorva d/o <a href=\\\"/doc/156136902/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Vinay Nichale v. Divisional Committee</a> 5. He\\n\\nsubmitted that if an applicant successfully establishes his caste\\n\\nclaim on the basis of documents relating to the pre­Constitution\\n\\nperiod or documents having probative value or a caste validity\\n\\ncertificate granted to his blood relative, it is not necessary to apply\\n\\nthe affinity test. In short, his submission is that the affinity test is\\n\\nnot a litmus test. He submitted that the view taken by this Court in\\n\\nthe case of Anand4 is based on the interpretation of the 2000 Act\\n\\nand the ST Rules. He pointed out that Vijakumar’s3 case has been\\n\\ndecided by this Court before the ST Rules came into force. He would\\n\\nurge that there are no reasons recorded in the decision to suggest\\n\\nthat the affinity test in every case is mandatory.</span>           <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"87068857\\\" id=\\\"span_18\\\">The learned\\n\\ncounsel pressed into service a decision of this Court in the case of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/87068857/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">District Collector, Satara &amp; Anr. v.

He also pointed out that an applicant\\n\\nwho is a member of a Scheduled Tribe and who has been staying in\\n\\nan   urban   area   may   not   be    conversant   with   the   traits,\\n\\ncharacteristics, ceremonies, and deities of the tribe. Learned senior\\n\\ncounsel also relied upon a decision of the Bombay High Court in\\n\\nWrit Petition No.4198 of 2005 dated 1 st August 2018, which holds\\n\\nthat in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Anand4, the\\n\\nimpugned judgment in the case of Shilpa Vishnu Thakur2 stands\\n\\nimpliedly overruled. He would, therefore, submit that the impugned\\n\\njudgment calls for modification and it must be held that the affinity\\n\\ntest is not of paramount importance while deciding a caste claim in\\n\\naccordance with the 2000 Act and the ST rules.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"34851\\\" id=\\\"span_20\\\">7.

She submitted that the State\\n\\nGovernment or Scrutiny Committee cannot hold any enquiry to\\n\\ndetermine whether or not some particular community falls within\\n\\nthe ST order.        She submitted that the State Government cannot\\n\\nmake an effort to indirectly modify the Third Schedule under the ST\\n\\nOrder as the modification can be carried out only in accordance\\n\\nwith <a href=\\\"/doc/68762/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Article 341</a> of the Constitution. Her submission is that in a\\n\\ngiven case if the documents having probative value show that the\\n\\napplicant belongs to the Thakur caste or belongs to any other caste\\n\\nnotified in the Third Schedule to the 1976 Act, there is no question\\n\\nof holding any affinity test.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_15\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"1192135\\\" id=\\\"span_22\\\">8.    Shri Shyam Divan, the learned senior counsel appearing for\\n\\nthe State of Maharashtra pointed out that it is judicially recognised\\n\\nthat the surname Thakur is shared by both forward and backward\\n\\nclass communities. He placed reliance on the decision in the case of\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1192135/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">State of Maharashtra &amp; Ors. v. Ravi Prakash Babulalsing Parmar\\n\\n&amp; Anr.8 He</a> pointed out that even in the impugned judgment, this\\n\\n\\n7 (1994) 1 SCC 359\\n8 (2007) 1 SCC 80\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_23\\\">                                    16</span>\\n\\ffactual aspect has been elaborately dealt with. He pointed out that\\n\\nunder the provisions of the 2000 Act, an inquiry is required to be\\n\\nmade at three stages. The first is an inquiry by a Competent\\n\\nAuthority for ascertaining the genuineness of the claim of the\\n\\napplicant on the basis of documents produced by him. If prima\\n\\nfacie, the Competent Authority is satisfied with the documents, it\\n\\nhas to issue a caste certificate which is subject to verification. The\\n\\nsecond stage is of domestic and school enquiry to be conducted by\\n\\nVigilance Cell which will include an affinity test and the third stage\\n\\nis of verification and scrutiny by the Scrutiny Committee which is a\\n\\nquasi­judicial authority.</span>\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_16\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_17\\\">9.   In the written submissions filed by him, he has contended that\\n\\neven if validity certificates have been issued by the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee in case of near relatives of the applicant, the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee has to apply an affinity test as an integral part of the\\n\\nprocess of assessing the entire evidence again to ensure that\\n\\nillegality is not perpetuated. He submitted that there are cases\\n\\nwhere a validity certificate is issued to a near relative by mistake or\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_24\\\">                                  17</span>\\n\\ffraud or without holding an enquiry as contemplated by law or\\n\\nwithout recording any reasons.     A submission is made that the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee can also go into the question whether the\\n\\nearlier validity certificate has been issued based on an erroneous\\n\\norder of the High Court. The submission canvassed is what is held\\n\\nin paragraph 22.1 in the decision in Anand’s case4 is erroneous.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_18\\\">10. It is submitted on behalf of the State Government that in a\\n\\ngiven case, the applicant may not be fully conversant with the traits,\\n\\nreligious ceremonies of the tribe or deities etc.      Therefore, the\\n\\nVigilance Cell is required to examine even the parents of the\\n\\napplicant.   The State Government urged that in the case of\\n\\nScheduled Tribe Thakur, a different test will apply as persons with\\n\\nthis surname belong even to forward classes. Therefore, in the case\\n\\nof the tribe claim of Thakur, pre­Constitution documents containing\\n\\nthe candidate’s surname as Thakur are of no consequence.\\n\\nTherefore, in the case of the tribe claim of Thakur, an affinity test\\n\\nhas to be applied. The submission of the State is that the view taken\\n\\nin the case of Vijakumar3 is correct and necessary clarifications will\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_25\\\">                                  18</span>\\n\\fhave to be issued regarding findings rendered in the case of Anand4\\n\\nin paragraph 22.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_20\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"1345725\\\" id=\\\"span_26\\\">11. Shri Ravi K. Deshpande, the learned senior counsel appearing\\n\\nin one of the connected matters urged that the Scrutiny Committee\\n\\nconstituted under the 2000 Act is not a quasi­judicial authority. He\\n\\nsubmitted that in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1345725/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">Dayaram v. Sudhir Batham &amp; Ors.9</a>,\\n\\nthis Court held that Scrutiny Committee is not a quasi­judicial\\n\\nauthority but it is an administrative authority.</span> He also urged that\\n\\nthe decision in the case of Dayaram9 has been followed by this\\n\\nCourt in the case of J. Chitra v. District Collector &amp; Chairman,\\n\\nState Level Vigilance Committee, Tamil Nadu &amp; Ors.10               He\\n\\nsubmitted that the finding of the High Court that the affinity test is\\n\\nan integral part of an enquiry by the Scrutiny Committee has no\\n\\nlegal basis at all. His submission is that Anand’s case4 has been\\n\\ncorrectly decided and to that extent, the impugned judgment in the\\n\\ncase of Shilpa Vishnu Thakur2 will have to be modified. One of the\\n\\ninterveners also relied upon the provisions of the SC Rules and\\n\\n9 (2012) 1 SCC 333\\n10 (2021) 9 SCC 811\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_27\\\">                                  19</span>\\n\\fsubmitted that though the same specifically empower the Vigilance\\n\\nCell to conduct affinity tests, such a provision is absent in the ST\\n\\nRules.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_21\\\">\\n\\n\\nOUR VIEW\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_22\\\">12. We have already made a reference in detail to the directions\\n\\nissued by this Court in the case of Kumari Madhuri Patil1. A co­\\n\\nordinate Bench in the case of Dayaram9, in paragraph 35 of its\\n\\ndecision, held that the directions issued by this Court in paragraph\\n\\n13 of Kumari Madhuri Patil’s case1 were issued as there was no\\n\\nstatute governing the field of verification of caste claims of\\n\\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Nomadic Tribes and Other\\n\\nBackward Classes. Therefore, it was held that the directions issued\\n\\nin the case of Kumari Madhuri Patil1 would apply only until\\n\\nappropriate legislation is enacted. Hence, after the 2000 Act came\\n\\ninto force, only the provisions of the said enactment will prevail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_28\\\">                                   20</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_23\\\">\\f13. Therefore, we will have to interpret the provisions of the 2000\\n\\nAct. The 2000 Act came into force on 18 th October 2001. As can be\\n\\nnoticed from the title, the 2000 Act deals with the regulation of\\n\\nissuance and verification of caste certificates in respect of persons\\n\\nbelonging to Scheduled Tribes, De­notified tribes, Nomadic Tribes,\\n\\nOther Backward Classes and Special Backward Category.          Under\\n\\nthe scheme of the 2000 Act, an application for the grant of caste\\n\\ncertificates is to be made to the Competent Authority as defined\\n\\nunder Section 2(b). The Competent Authority is mandated to follow\\n\\nthe procedure prescribed by the Rules. After following the procedure\\n\\nprescribed, if the Competent Authority is satisfied that the claim\\n\\nmade by the candidate is genuine, it can issue a caste certificate in\\n\\na prescribed form. Sub­section (1) of Section 4, for good reasons,\\n\\nspecifically provides that if the application is rejected, the reasons\\n\\nfor the rejection must be recorded.        As an order rejecting the\\n\\napplication for the grant of a caste certificate is made appealable\\n\\nunder sub­section (1) of Section 5, the appellate authority should\\n\\nhave the benefit of the reasons for rejection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_29\\\">                                   21</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_24\\\">\\f14. Under Section 9, the Competent Authority, Appellate Authority\\n\\nand Scrutiny Committee have been granted powers of Civil Court\\n\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/161831507/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908 of summoning and\\n\\nenforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath,\\n\\nrequiring the discovery and production of any documents, receiving\\n\\nevidence on affidavits, requisitioning any public record or copy\\n\\nthereof from any Court or office and issuing commissions for the\\n\\nexamination of witnesses or documents. However, the nature and\\n\\nextent of the inquiry which is required to be made by the Competent\\n\\nAuthority and by the Scrutiny Committee differ. The 2000 Act has\\n\\nintroduced a two­tier system for the verification of caste claims. In\\n\\nview of the express language used by sub­section (2) of <a href=\\\"/doc/176775526/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">Section 4</a>,\\n\\nthe caste certificate issued by the Competent Authority does not\\n\\nconclusively establish the caste claim of the applicant. The person\\n\\nto whom the caste certificate is granted by the Competent Authority\\n\\ncannot claim that his caste status has been established. The caste\\n\\ncertificate issued by Competent Authority becomes conclusive\\n\\nevidence of the caste stated therein only after a detailed enquiry as\\n\\ncontemplated by the 2000 Act and rules framed thereunder is made\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_30\\\">                                 22</span>\\n\\fby the Scrutiny Committee and the certificate is validated.\\n\\nTherefore, when an application made under <a href=\\\"/doc/80722670/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Section 3</a> for the grant\\n\\nof a caste certificate is considered by the Competent Authority, very\\n\\ndetailed scrutiny of material produced by the applicant is not\\n\\ncontemplated. What is contemplated is prima facie satisfaction of\\n\\nthe genuineness of the caste claim and on the basis of such\\n\\nsatisfaction that a caste certificate as contemplated by sub­section\\n\\n(1) of <a href=\\\"/doc/176775526/\\\" id=\\\"a_20\\\">Section 4</a> can be issued. Therefore, sub­section (1) of <a href=\\\"/doc/176775526/\\\" id=\\\"a_21\\\">Section\\n\\n4</a> specifically requires the Competent Authority to record reasons for\\n\\nrejecting the application but there is no such requirement\\n\\nincorporated of giving reasons while granting a caste certificate.\\n\\nHowever, the Caste Scrutiny Committee is expected to record\\n\\nreasons both for validating and not validating the caste certificate.\\n\\nSub­rule (6) of Rule 4 of the ST Rules provides that the Competent\\n\\nAuthority shall verify the documents produced by the applicant with\\n\\nthe original documents and if satisfied with the correctness of the\\n\\ninformation, documents and evidence furnished by the applicant, it\\n\\nshall issue a Scheduled Tribe certificate within 15 days from the\\n\\ndate of receipt of the application.   The time limit fixed under the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_31\\\">                                 23</span>\\n\\fsaid Rule is also a pointer which suggests that the enquiry to be\\n\\nmade by the Competent Authority is a summary enquiry and a\\n\\ndetailed enquiry is not contemplated. The mandate of issuing caste\\n\\ncertificates within 15 days cannot be accomplished if the Competent\\n\\nAuthority is to hold a detailed enquiry on par with the one which is\\n\\nrequired to be held by the Scrutiny Committee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_25\\\">15. The law contemplates very detailed scrutiny of the caste claim\\n\\nby the Scrutiny Committee. If both the Competent Authority and\\n\\nthe Caste Scrutiny Committee were to make the same degree of\\n\\nscrutiny and detailed enquiry into caste claims, the very object of\\n\\nthe two­tier scrutiny will be frustrated.   <a href=\\\"/doc/63755459/\\\" id=\\\"a_22\\\">Section 8</a> provides that the\\n\\nburden of proving a caste claim before the Competent Authority and\\n\\nthe Scrutiny Committee is on the applicant. For discharging the\\n\\nsaid burden before the Competent Authority, it is enough if the\\n\\napplicant produces prima facie material to show that his caste claim\\n\\nis genuine. The burden put by <a href=\\\"/doc/63755459/\\\" id=\\\"a_23\\\">Section 8</a> on the applicant to prove\\n\\nhis caste status before the Scrutiny Committee is much higher than\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_32\\\">                                   24</span>\\n\\fthe burden which he is required to discharge before the Competent\\n\\nAuthority.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_26\\\">\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_27\\\">16. Sub­section (1) of <a href=\\\"/doc/85279687/\\\" id=\\\"a_24\\\">Section 10</a> contemplates that if an applicant,\\n\\non the basis of a caste certificate issued by the Competent Authority\\n\\nobtains any benefit such as employment or admission to an\\n\\neducational institution, on cancellation of the caste certificate by the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee, the admission secured to the educational\\n\\ninstitution or employment is required to be cancelled forthwith. The\\n\\nscheme of <a href=\\\"/doc/85279687/\\\" id=\\\"a_25\\\">Section 10</a> is that applicant cannot hold on to any benefit\\n\\nreceived by him on the basis of a caste certificate issued by the\\n\\nCompetent Authority which is subsequently cancelled by the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_28\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_29\\\">17. <a href=\\\"/doc/31796670/\\\" id=\\\"a_26\\\">Section 6</a> deals with the procedure to be followed by the Caste\\n\\nScrutiny Committee for verification of caste certificates. Sub­section\\n\\n(4) of <a href=\\\"/doc/31796670/\\\" id=\\\"a_27\\\">Section 6</a> lays down that the Scrutiny Committee shall follow\\n\\nthe procedure as laid down by the Rules framed under the 2000 Act.\\n\\nRule 4 of the ST Rules lays down the procedure to be followed by the\\n\\nCompetent Authority.        We must note that under Rule 10, a\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_33\\\">                                   25</span>\\n\\fprovision has been made for constituting a Vigilance Cell to assist\\n\\nthe Scheduled Tribes Caste Scrutiny Committee in conducting an\\n\\nenquiry.

Sub­rule (2) of Rule 12 clearly provides that only if the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee is not satisfied with the documentary evidence\\n\\nproduced by the applicant, it shall forward the application to the\\n\\nVigilance Cell for conducting the school, home and other enquiry.\\n\\nTherefore, in every case, as a matter of routine, the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee cannot mechanically forward the application to Vigilance\\n\\nCell for conducting an enquiry.      When sub­rule (2) of Rule 12\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_38\\\">                                30</span>\\n\\fcontemplates that only if the Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied\\n\\nwith the documents produced by the applicant that the case should\\n\\nbe referred to Vigilance Cell, it follows that the Scrutiny Committee\\n\\nis required to pass an order recording brief reasons why it is not\\n\\nsatisfied with the documents produced by the applicant.       Before\\n\\nreferring the case to the Vigilance Cell, application of mind to the\\n\\nmaterial produced by the applicant is required and therefore, the\\n\\napplication of mind must be reflected in the order sheets of the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_41\\\">20. It is not possible to exhaustively lay down in which cases the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee must refer the case to Vigilance Cell. One of\\n\\nthe tests is as laid down in the case of Kumari Madhuri Patil1. It\\n\\nlays down that the documents of the pre­Constitution period\\n\\nshowing the caste of the applicant and their ancestors have got the\\n\\nhighest probative value.   For example, if an applicant is able to\\n\\nproduce authentic and genuine documents of the pre­Constitution\\n\\nperiod showing that he belongs to a tribal community, there is no\\n\\nreason to discard his claim as prior to 1950, there were no\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_39\\\">                                 31</span>\\n\\freservations provided to the Tribes included in the ST order.         In\\n\\nsuch a case, a reference to Vigilance Cell is not warranted at all.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_42\\\">21. In the impugned judgment in Civil Appeal No. 2502 of 2022\\n\\n(Shilpa Vishnu Thakur’s case2), the Full Bench of the Bombay High\\n\\nCourt has noted that people having the surname “Thakur” belong to\\n\\nboth forward castes and various backward castes.        Therefore, the\\n\\nFull Bench may be right in saying that in every case, only on the\\n\\nbasis of the surname Thakur, it cannot be concluded by the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee that the applicant belongs to Scheduled Tribe\\n\\nThakur notified in the Entry 44 of the Maharashtra list. However,\\n\\nwe must note that in the case of a person having the surname\\n\\nThakur, there may be evidence in the form of entry of the name of\\n\\nthe caste as a Tribe or Scheduled Tribe in the land records, school\\n\\nor college records or any official records concerning the applicant or\\n\\nhis ancestors. Only on the ground that the persons having the\\n\\nsurname Thakur may belong to a forward caste as well, it is not\\n\\nnecessary that in every case, the Scrutiny Committee should send\\n\\nthe case to Vigilance Cell.    It all depends on the nature of the\\n\\ndocuments produced before the Caste Scrutiny Committee and the\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_40\\\">                                  32</span>\\n\\fprobative value of the documents. Therefore, whenever a caste claim\\n\\nregarding Thakur Scheduled Tribe is considered, the Caste Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee in every case should not mechanically refer the case to\\n\\nthe Vigilance Cell for conducting an enquiry including affinity test.\\n\\nThe reference to the Vigilance Cell can be made only if the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee is not satisfied with the material produced by the\\n\\napplicant.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_43\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_44\\\">22. We can also contemplate one more scenario which is found in\\n\\nmany cases. These are the cases where the applicant relies upon\\n\\ncaste validity certificates issued to his blood relatives. Obviously,\\n\\nsuch a validity certificate has to be issued either by the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee constituted in terms of the directions issued in Kumari\\n\\nMadhuri Patil’s case1 or constituted under the Rules framed under\\n\\nthe 2000 Act. In such a case, firstly, the Scrutiny Committee must\\n\\nascertain whether the certificate is genuine. Secondly, the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee will have to decide whether the applicant has established\\n\\nthat the person to whom the validity certificate relied upon by him\\n\\nhas been issued is his blood relative. For that purpose, the\\n\\napplicant must establish his precise and exact relationship with the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_41\\\">                                 33</span>\\n\\fperson to whom the validity certificate has been granted. Moreover,\\n\\nan enquiry will have to be made by the Scrutiny Committee whether\\n\\nthe validity certificate has been granted to the blood relative of the\\n\\napplicant by the concerned Scrutiny Committee after holding due\\n\\nenquiry and following due procedure. Therefore, if the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee has issued a validity certificate contemplated in terms of\\n\\nthe decision in the case of Kumari Madhuri Patil1, the examination\\n\\nwill be whether the enquiry contemplated by the said decision has\\n\\nbeen held. If the certificate relied upon is issued after coming into\\n\\nforce of the 2000 Act, the Scrutiny Committee will have to ascertain\\n\\nwhether the concerned Scrutiny Committee had followed the\\n\\nprocedure laid down therein as well as in the ST Rules or the SC\\n\\nRules, as the case may be. For this verification, the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee can exercise powers conferred on it by <a href=\\\"/doc/76869205/\\\" id=\\\"a_28\\\">Section 9(d)</a> by\\n\\nrequisitioning   the   record    of   the   concerned   Caste   Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee, which has issued the validity certificate to the blood\\n\\nrelative of the applicant.      If the record has been destroyed, the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee can ascertain whether a due enquiry has been\\n\\nheld on the basis of the decision of the Caste Scrutiny Committee by\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_42\\\">                                      34</span>\\n\\fwhich caste validity has been granted to the blood relative of the\\n\\napplicant. If it is established that the validity certificate has been\\n\\ngranted without holding a proper inquiry or without recording\\n\\nreasons, obviously, the caste scrutiny committee cannot validate the\\n\\ncaste certificate only on the basis of such validity certificate of the\\n\\nblood relative.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_45\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_46\\\">23. In a given case, the Scrutiny Committee may be satisfied that\\n\\nthe caste validity certificate relied upon by the applicant has been\\n\\nissued after making a lawful enquiry. But if the Scrutiny Committee\\n\\nis of the view that the applicant has not clearly established that the\\n\\nperson to whom caste validity certificate produced on record has\\n\\nbeen granted is his blood relative, in terms of sub­rule (2) of Rule 12\\n\\nof the ST Rules, the Caste Scrutiny Committee will have to refer the\\n\\ncase for conducting an enquiry through Vigilance Cell. In such a\\n\\ncase, the Vigilance Cell can be directed by the Scrutiny Committee\\n\\nto conduct an enquiry limited to the relationship claimed by the\\n\\napplicant with the person in whose favour the caste validity\\n\\ncertificate has been issued. If, on the basis of the report of the\\n\\nVigilance Cell, the Scrutiny Committee is satisfied that the person in\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_43\\\">                                  35</span>\\n\\fwhose favour caste validity certificate has been issued is a blood\\n\\nrelative of the applicant and lawful enquiry has been conducted\\n\\nbefore issuing the validity certificate, the Scrutiny Committee will\\n\\nhave to issue validity certificate even if the applicant does not satisfy\\n\\nthe affinity test. For example, if it is established that the father or\\n\\ngrandfather of the applicant has been given a caste validity\\n\\ncertificate after holding a lawful enquiry in accordance with law, the\\n\\nCaste Scrutiny Committee cannot hold that the grandfather or\\n\\nfather of the applicant, as the case may be, belongs to Scheduled\\n\\nTribe but the applicant does not belong to Scheduled Tribe. Only if\\n\\nthe relationship as pleaded by the applicant is not established, the\\n\\nother evidence produced by the applicant and the result of the\\n\\naffinity test can be taken into consideration by the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_47\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_48\\\">24. As provided in sub­rule (7) of Rule 12 of the ST Rules, the\\n\\nVigilance Cell’s report is not conclusive. If on the basis of the report\\n\\nof the Vigilance Cell and other evidence on record, the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee comes to a conclusion that the caste claim is genuine, a\\n\\ncaste validity certificate can be issued. Only on the ground that the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_44\\\">                                   36</span>\\n\\freport of vigilance cell is in favour of the applicant, validity\\n\\ncertificate cannot be mechanically granted without application of\\n\\nmind. If the report of the Vigilance Cell is against the applicant, his\\n\\ncaste claim cannot be rejected only on the basis of the report of the\\n\\nVigilance Cell without providing a copy of the report to the applicant\\n\\nand without giving him an opportunity of being heard on the report.\\n\\nAfter giving an opportunity to the applicant to make submissions on\\n\\nthe report, the Scrutiny Committee may reject the caste claim. In a\\n\\ngiven case, the Scrutiny Committee can also record a finding that\\n\\nthe caste claim is genuine. It all depends on the facts of each case.\\n\\n\\nAFFINITY TEST\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_49\\\">25. Now, we come to the controversy regarding the affinity test. In\\n\\nclause (5) of Paragraph 13 of the decision in the case of Kumari\\n\\nMadhuri Patil1 it is held that in the case of Scheduled Tribes, the\\n\\nVigilance   Cell   will   submit   a    report   as   regards   peculiar\\n\\nanthropological and ethnological traits, deities, rituals, customs,\\n\\nmode of marriage, death ceremonies, methods of burial of dead\\n\\nbodies etc. in respect of the particular caste or tribe.          Such\\n\\nparticulars ascertained by the Vigilance Cell in respect of a\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_45\\\">                                   37</span>\\n\\fparticular Scheduled Tribe are very relevant for the conduct of the\\n\\naffinity test. The Vigilance Cell, while conducting an affinity test,\\n\\nverifies the knowledge of the applicant about deities of the\\n\\ncommunity, customs, rituals, mode of marriage, death ceremonies\\n\\netc. in respect of that particular Scheduled Tribe.      By its very\\n\\nnature, such an affinity test can never be conclusive.         If the\\n\\napplicant has stayed in bigger urban areas along with his family for\\n\\ndecades or if his family has stayed in such urban areas for decades,\\n\\nthe applicant may not have knowledge of the aforesaid facts. It is\\n\\ntrue that the Vigilance Cell can also question the parents of the\\n\\napplicant. But in a given case, even the parents may be unaware\\n\\nfor the reason that for several years they have been staying in bigger\\n\\nurban areas. On the other hand, a person may not belong to the\\n\\nparticular tribe, but he may have a good knowledge about the\\n\\naforesaid aspects.   Therefore, Shri Shekhar Naphade, the learned\\n\\nsenior counsel, is right when he submitted that the affinity test\\n\\ncannot be applied as a litmus test. We may again note here that\\n\\nquestion of conduct of the affinity test arises only in those cases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_46\\\">                                  38</span>\\n\\fwhere the Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied with the material\\n\\nproduced by the applicant.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_50\\\">26. There is an argument made that as far as SC Rules are\\n\\nconcerned, clause (d) of Rule 13 specifically provides for Vigilance\\n\\nCell conducting an affinity test and there is no such pari materia\\n\\nprovision in the ST Rules. We are unable to accept this submission\\n\\nas sub­rule (4) of Rule 12 of the ST Rules enjoins the vigilance\\n\\nofficer to collect facts about the social status of the applicant or his\\n\\nparents, as the case may be. Therefore, sub­rule (5) provides for the\\n\\nexamination of the applicant and his parents.       For verification of\\n\\nsocial status as contemplated by sub­rule (4) of Rule 12 of the ST\\n\\nRules, in a given case, affinity test can be resorted to by the\\n\\nVigilance Cell.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_51\\\">\\n\\nWHETHER CASTE SCRUTINY COMMITTEE\\nPERFORMS QUASI­JUDICIAL FUNCTION\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_52\\\">27. Before we go into the decisions in the cases of Vijakumar3 and\\n\\nAnand4, we need to deal with an argument made by one of the\\n\\ninterveners that the Scrutiny Committee is not a quasi­judicial\\n\\nauthority. The said submission is based on a decision of coordinate\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_47\\\">                                   39</span>\\n\\fBench of this Court in the case of Dayaram9.

We must note here that this Court was dealing in the said\\n\\ndecision with a case arising from the State of Madhya Pradesh\\n\\nwhere there was no statute in existence which covered the field\\n\\noccupied by Kumari Madhuri Patil’s case1.                   Therefore, the\\n\\nobservations made in the said decision are in the context of powers\\n\\nof the Scrutiny Committee ordered to be created under the decision\\n\\nin the case of Kumari Madhuri Patil1. In the cases of Dayaram9\\n\\nand Jay Chitra10, this Court has not dealt with the 2000 Act or a\\n\\nsimilar enactment applicable to any other State.            On a conjoint\\n\\nreading of the 2000 Act as well as ST and SC Rules framed\\n\\nthereunder,   it   is   impossible   to   conclude   that    the   Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee discharges only administrative functions. The Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee under the 2000 Act has been entrusted with various\\n\\npowers of the Civil Court under <a href=\\\"/doc/161831507/\\\" id=\\\"a_30\\\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908.\\n\\nThe powers include a power to enforce the attendance of any\\n\\nwitness, to receive evidence on affidavits, to issue commissions for\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_49\\\">                                     41</span>\\n\\fthe examination of witnesses or documents etc. The scheme of the\\n\\n2000 Act and both SC and ST Rules provides for the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee holding an enquiry on the caste claim of the applicant, if\\n\\nnecessary, after examining the applicant on oath, recording\\n\\nevidence of witnesses and calling for documents and records etc.\\n\\nThe Scrutiny Committee is expected to record reasons for granting\\n\\nand rejecting the prayer for issue of caste validity certificates. Thus,\\n\\nthe Scrutiny Committee has all the trappings of a quasi­judicial\\n\\nauthority.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_56\\\">DECISIONS IN THE CASES OF VIJAKUMAR &amp;\\nANAND\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_57\\\">29. Now, we come to the decision in the case of Vijakumar3.           A\\n\\nperusal of the decision in the case of Vijakumar3 shows that a\\n\\nBench of two Hon’ble Judges dealt with issue of a tribe claim arising\\n\\nfrom the State of Maharashtra.      A careful perusal of the decision\\n\\nshows that there is not even a reference to the ST Rules in the said\\n\\ndecision. The attention of the Court was not invited to sub­rule (2)\\n\\nof Rule 12, which lays down that the case can be referred to the\\n\\nVigilance Cell only if the Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied with\\n\\nthe material produced by the applicant. Without referring to the\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_50\\\">                                   42</span>\\n\\fprovisions of the 2000 Act as well as SC and ST Rules, in paragraph\\n\\n9 of Vijakumar’s case3, it is held that:­\\n\\n        “9. Having heard the learned counsel for the\\n        parties, we are of the considered opinion that there\\n        is hardly any merit in the contentions raised on\\n        behalf of the appellant. The affinity test was\\n        completed by the Vigilance Officer as well as by the\\n        Scrutiny Committee. The certificate has to be\\n        validated only after it proves factually and legally\\n        correct at the two stages; firstly, at the stage of\\n        issuance and secondly, at the stage of verification.\\n        If it fails the affinity test at either of these stages,\\n        the validity of the certificate cannot be sustained.”\\n\\nHence, in view of the fact that the 2000 Act and Rules were not\\n\\nconsidered, the decision in the case of Vijakumar3 is certainly not a\\n\\nbinding precedent for the proposition that in every case, the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee is required to take recourse to the affinity test\\n\\nby referring the case to the Vigilance Cell.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_58\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_59\\\">30. The decision in the case of Anand4 in paragraphs 4 and 5\\n\\nspecifically refers to Rule 11 and 12 (2) of the ST Rules.         In\\n\\nparagraph 22, this Court held thus:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_22\\\">        “22. It is manifest from the aforeextracted\\n        paragraph that the genuineness of a caste claim\\n        has to be considered not only on a thorough\\n        examination of the documents submitted in\\n        support of the claim but also on the affinity test,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_51\\\">                                   43</span>\\n\\fwhich would include the anthropological and\\nethnological traits, etc., of the applicant. However,\\nit is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down an\\nabsolute rule, which could be applied mechanically\\nto examine a caste claim. Nevertheless, we feel that\\nthe following broad parameters could be kept in\\nview while dealing with a caste claim:\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_23\\\">  (i)   While dealing with documentary evidence,\\n        greater reliance may be placed on pre­\\n        Independence documents because they\\n        furnish a higher degree of probative value to\\n        the declaration of status of a caste, as\\n        compared         to      post­Independence\\n        documents. In case the applicant is the first\\n        generation ever to attend school, the\\n        availability of any documentary evidence\\n        becomes difficult, but that ipso facto does\\n        not call for the rejection of his claim. In\\n        fact, the mere fact that he is the first\\n        generation ever to attend school, some\\n        benefit of doubt in favour of the applicant\\n        may be given. Needless to add that in the\\n        event of a doubt on the credibility of a\\n        document, its veracity has to be tested on\\n        the basis of oral evidence, for which an\\n        opportunity has to be afforded to the\\n        applicant;\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_24\\\">        (ii) While applying the affinity test,\\n        which focuses on the ethnological\\n        connections with the Scheduled Tribe, a\\n        cautious approach has to be adopted. A\\n        few decades ago, when the tribes were\\n        somewhat immune to the cultural\\n        development happening around them,\\n        the affinity test could serve as a\\n        determinative factor. However, with the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_52\\\">                         44</span>\\n\\f              migrations, modernisation and contact\\n              with     other      communities,        these\\n              communities tend to develop and adopt\\n              new traits which may not essentially\\n              match         with       the       traditional\\n              characteristics of the tribe. Hence, the\\n              affinity test may not be regarded as a\\n              litmus test for establishing the link of\\n              the applicant with a Scheduled Tribe.\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_60\\\">              Nevertheless, the claim by an applicant\\n              that he is a part of a Scheduled Tribe and\\n              is entitled to the benefit extended to\\n              that tribe, cannot per se be disregarded\\n              on the ground that his present traits do\\n              not     match      his     tribe&#x27;s    peculiar\\n              anthropological and ethnological traits,\\n              deity,    rituals,   customs,      mode     of\\n              marriage, death ceremonies, method of\\n              burial of dead bodies, etc. Thus, the\\n              affinity test may be used to corroborate\\n              the documentary evidence and should\\n              not be the sole criteria to reject a\\n              claim.”\\n                                     (emphasis added)\\n\\nWe have recorded similar reasons earlier for coming to the\\n\\nconclusion that affinity test will not always be mandatory and/or\\n\\nconclusive.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_61\\\">31. Paragraph 19 of the decision in the case of Anand4 reiterates\\n\\nthe position that Vigilance Cell enquiry can be ordered only when\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_53\\\">                                45</span>\\n\\fthe Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied with the materials produced\\n\\nby the applicant. On this aspect, we may make useful reference to a\\n\\ndecision of this Court in the case of District Collector, Satara6.\\n\\nThis decision is penned down by one of us (Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.)\\n\\nwhich makes an in­depth analysis of the ST Rules and in particular,\\n\\nRule 12. In paragraph 9, this Court held thus:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_25\\\">            <span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"799713\\\" id=\\\"span_54\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neg\\\" data-docid=\\\"223323\\\" id=\\\"span_55\\\">“9. … … … … … … … … … … … … … … …\\n            A reading of the aforesaid Rules shows that\\n            the role of the Vigilance Cell was restricted\\n            as compared to the role envisaged\\n            under <a href=\\\"/doc/223323/\\\" id=\\\"a_31\\\">Madhuri         Patil</a>    case [<a href=\\\"/doc/799713/\\\" id=\\\"a_32\\\">Madhuri\\n            Patil v.

Therefore, as observed earlier, the decision in the case of\\n\\nVijakumar3 cannot be read as a binding precedent laying down a\\n\\nlegal principle that in every case of verification of caste claim, the\\n\\nCaste Scrutiny Committee is under a mandate to refer the case to\\n\\nthe Vigilance Cell. As under the scheme of ST Rules, affinity test is\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_56\\\">                                  46</span>\\n\\fto be conducted by the Vigilance Cell, it follows that question of\\n\\nconducting of affinity test will arise only when a case is made out for\\n\\nreferring the case to Vigilance Cell. If the Scrutiny Committee, after\\n\\nholding an enquiry is satisfied with the material produced on\\n\\nrecord, without referring the case to the Vigilance Cell, the Caste\\n\\nScrutiny Committee is under a mandate to grant validity to the\\n\\ncaste certificate.   As noted earlier, in a given case, the Scrutiny\\n\\nCommittee can order a limited inquiry by the Vigilance Cell.       For\\n\\nexample, if an applicant is relying upon a caste validity certificate\\n\\ngranted to his blood relative and the Scrutiny Committee, after\\n\\nfinding that the certificate is issued after due inquiry entertains a\\n\\ndoubt about the relationship pleaded, it can direct the Vigilance Cell\\n\\nto make inquiry only about the relationship.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_63\\\">\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_64\\\">33. Now we come to the impugned Judgment in Shilpa Vishnu\\n\\nThakur’s case2. The questions framed for consideration by the Full\\n\\nBench are in paragraph 4 which reads thus:\\n</p>\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_26\\\">            “(i) Should the paramount consideration in\\n            determining the caste claim of a person be\\n            documentary evidence or, as the Supreme\\n            Court held, “anthropological moorings and\\n            ethnological kinship”; and is the “crucial\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_57\\\">                                  47</span>\\n\\f           affinity test” relevant and germane for such a\\n           decision?\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_27\\\">           (ii)(a) In cases where the documents produced\\n           by a person claiming to be belonging to a\\n           particular caste satisfy the requirement, for\\n           example, in the case of “Thakur”, if all the\\n           documents produced/filed and relied upon by\\n           a candidate denote his caste as “Thakur”\\n           then, without validating the caste claim with\\n           reference to the “crucial affinity test”, should\\n           the caste claim be validated or not?\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_28\\\">           (b) In a case where a person is not in\\n           possession of any document to meet the\\n           requirements of a particular caste claim can\\n           the claim be scrutinized on the basis of the\\n           “crucial affinity test”, and a validity certificate\\n           be issued?\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_29\\\">           (c) Where a person who claims to belong to a\\n           particular caste has some documents in his\\n           favour and/or partially satisfies the crucial\\n           affinity test, can the claim be certified and is\\n           the candidate entitled to his caste certificate\\n           being validated?” *\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_65\\\">34. The conclusions of the Full Bench have been recorded in\\n\\nparagraph 40. In clause (i) of paragraph 40, the Full Bench of the\\n\\nHigh Court records that under Rule 12(2), the Scrutiny Committee,\\n\\nif it is not satisfied with the documentary evidence produced, has to\\n\\nforward the application to Vigilance Cell for holding a school, home\\n\\nand other enquiry. The Full Bench does not lay down that in every\\n\\ncase where the Scrutiny Committee is dealing with a Scheduled\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_58\\\">                                   48</span>\\n\\fTribe claim, a reference must be made to the Vigilance Cell.         In\\n\\nclause (ii) (a) of paragraph 40, the Full Bench records that the\\n\\nScrutiny Committee must have regard to the entire body of\\n\\nevidence, including on the question as to whether the applicant has\\n\\nsatisfied the affinity test. As held earlier, the question of taking\\n\\nrecourse to the affinity test will arise only if the case is referred to\\n\\nVigilance Cell. In fact, in clause (b) of paragraph 40, the Full Bench\\n\\nholds that even if an applicant does not have any documentary\\n\\nevidence it will not ipso facto result into invalidation of the caste\\n\\nclaim. The reason is that in such a case, sub­rule (2) of Rule 12 will\\n\\napply and the Vigilance Cell will have to hold an enquiry including\\n\\naffinity test. Even in such a case, affinity test will not be conclusive\\n\\neither way as held in clause (2) of paragraph 20 in Anand’s case4.\\n\\nIn clause (c) of the same paragraph, the Full Bench of the High\\n\\nCourt also holds that even if the applicant partially satisfies the\\n\\naffinity test, depending upon the nature of the evidence on record,\\n\\nthe Scrutiny Committee has power to validate the claim. Thus, even\\n\\nclause (c) proceeds on the footing that the affinity test is not\\n\\nconclusive.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_66\\\">\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_59\\\">                                   49</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_67\\\">\\f35. Reading paragraph 40 of the impugned judgment as a whole,\\n\\nwe cannot conclude that a finding has been recorded by the full\\n\\nBench about the conclusive nature of the affinity test. The finding\\n\\ncannot be understood to mean that reference to the Vigilance Cell\\n\\nand conduct of affinity test is mandatory in every case. However, we\\n\\nmake it clear that for the reasons we have recorded in this\\n\\njudgment, we do not approve the observation in the impugned\\n\\njudgment that “the affinity test is an integral part of the\\n\\ndetermination of the correctness of the claim”\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_68\\\">36.
