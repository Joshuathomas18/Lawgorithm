She has also filed two\\n\\ncases. H.M.O.P. No.1741 of 2021 has been filed by her before the\\n\\nFamily Court at Chennai against her husband for restitution of\\n\\nconjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and\\n\\nM.C. Sr. No.672 of 2021 before the Family Court at Chennai for\\n\\nmaintenance under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">5.   The appellant in her petition filed under <a href=\\\"/doc/322349/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Section 9</a> of the Hindu\\n\\nMarriage Act has contended amongst others that without any\\n\\nreasonable excuse, the respondent withdrew from her society and\\n\\nthat the respondent is bound to live with the appellant and give her\\n\\nconjugal companionship.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">6.   The appellant filed a petition under <a href=\\\"/doc/36791901/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Section 24</a> of the Code of\\n\\nCivil Procedure before the High Court of Judicature at Madras for\\n\\ntransfer of F.C.O.P. No.125 of 2020 pending on the file of the Family\\n\\nCourt, Vellore to the Family Court at Chennai.      According to the\\n\\nappellant, her parents are old and that she is aged 21 years and not\\n\\nin a position to travel to Vellore through out the court proceedings\\n\\nwithout having any support. In addition, the appellant contends that\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">\\f                                  3</span>\\n\\nit would not be possible for her aged parents to accompany her to\\n\\nVellore. She is totally dependent on her parents morally and\\n\\nfinancially. She is not employed and does not have any other source\\n\\nof income. Moreover, she does not have any accommodation for\\n\\nstaying at Vellore. The respondent has opposed the said petition. As\\n\\nnoticed above, the High Court has dismissed the transfer petition.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">7.   We have heard learned counsel for the parties.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">8.   It is not disputed that the appellant is the resident of Chennai\\n\\nand that the appellant’s husband-respondent herein is the resident\\n\\nof Vellore and he is employed. The appellant who is 21 years old\\n\\ndoes not have any source of income of her own as she is not\\n\\nemployed and is totally dependent on her parents for her livelihood.\\n\\nIn order to attend the court proceedings of the case filed by her\\n\\nhusband at Vellore she has to travel alone all the way from Chennai\\n\\nto Vellore as her parents are not in a position to accompany her on\\n\\naccount of their old age. Secondly, the appellant has also filed a\\n\\npetition, H.M.O.P. No.1741 of 2021, for restitution of conjugal rights\\n\\nand another petition, M.C. Sr. No.672 of 2021, for her maintenance\\n\\nbefore the Family Court at Chennai.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">9.   The cardinal principle for exercise of power under <a href=\\\"/doc/36791901/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section 24</a> of\\n\\nthe Code of Civil Procedure is that the ends of justice should demand\\n\\nthe transfer of the suit, appeal or other proceeding. In matrimonial\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">\\f                                   4</span>\\n\\nmatters, wherever Courts are called upon to consider the plea of\\n\\ntransfer, the Courts have to take into consideration the economic\\n\\nsoundness of both the parties, the social strata of the spouses and\\n\\ntheir behavioural pattern, their standard of life prior to the marriage\\n\\nand subsequent thereto and the circumstances of both the parties in\\n\\neking out their livelihood and under whose protective umbrella they\\n\\nare seeking their sustenance to life.     Given the prevailing socio-\\n\\neconomic paradigm in the Indian society, generally, it is the wife’s\\n\\nconvenience which must be looked at while considering transfer.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">10.    Further, when two or more proceedings are pending in different\\n\\nCourts between the same parties which raise common question of\\n\\nfact   and   law,   and   when   the   decisions   in   the   cases   are\\n\\ninterdependent, it is desirable that they should be tried together by\\n\\nthe same Judge so as to avoid multiplicity in trial of the same issues\\n\\nand conflict of decisions.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">11.    As noticed above, the appellant is a young lady aged about 21\\n\\nyears, staying alone along with her aged parents. Under the above\\n\\ncircumstances, it is difficult for her to travel all the way from\\n\\nChennai to Vellore to attend the court proceedings of the case filed\\n\\nby the respondent seeking annulment of marriage. Further, it is also\\n\\njust and proper to club all the three cases together to avoid\\n\\nmultiplicity of the proceedings and conflict of decisions. Therefore,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">\\f                                    5</span>\\n\\nthe High Court was not justified in rejecting transfer petition bearing\\n\\nTR.C.M.P.No.473 of 2020, filed by the appellant herein.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">12.   Resultantly, the appeal succeeds and is accordingly allowed.\\n\\nThe Order dated 19.11.2020 passed by the High Court in TR.C.M.P.\\n\\nNO.473 of 2020 is set aside. We direct transfer of F.C.O.P. No.125 of\\n\\n2020 pending consideration before the Family Court, Vellore to the\\n\\njurisdictional Family Court at Chennai. We also direct the clubbing of\\n\\nthe aforementioned three cases so that a common order may be\\n\\npassed by the concerned Family Court at Chennai.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">13.   We direct the parties to bear their respective costs.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_15\\\">14.
