We, therefore, direct the Magistrates/ Police authorities that when accused alleged with offence punishable up to 7 years imprisonment are produced before them remands may be granted to accused only after the Magistrate satisfies himself that the application for remand by the police officer has been made in a bona fide manner and the reasons for seeking remand mentioned in the case diary are in accordance with the requirements of <a href=\\\"/doc/1899251/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Section 41(I) (b)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">41 A </a>Cr.P.C., and there is concrete material in existence  to substantiate the ground mentioned for seeking remand. Even where the accused himself surrenders or where investigation has been completed and the Magistrate needs to take the accused in judicial custody as provided under Section 170(I) and <a href=\\\"/doc/1899251/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Section 41(I)(b)(ii)(e)</a> Cr.P.C. prolonged imprisonment at this initial stage, where the accused has not been adjudged guilty may not be called for, and the Magistrate and Sessions Courts are to consider the bails expeditiously and not to mechanically refuse the same, especially in short sentence cases punishable with upto 7 years imprisonment unless the allegations are grave and there is any legal impediment in allowing the bail, as laid down in <a href=\\\"/doc/674840/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Lal Kamlendra Prap Singh Vs. State of U.P.</a> (2009) 4 SCC 437, and Sheoraj Singh @ Chuttan Vs. State of U.P. and others, 2009(65) ACC 781. The facility of releasing the accused on interim bail pending consideration of their regular bails may also be accorded by the Magistrates  and Sessions Judges to appropriate cases.</span>\\n</blockquote> \\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_15\\\">21.The Magistrate may also furnish information to the Registrar of the High Court through the District Judge, in case he is satisfied that a particular police officer has been persistently arresting accused in cases punishable with upto 7 year terms, in a mechanical or mala fide and dishonest manner, in contravention of the requirements of sections 41(1)(b) and 41 A, and thereafter the matter may be placed by the Registrar in this case, so that appropriate directions may be issued to the DGP to take action against such errant police officer for his persistent default or this Court may initiate contempt proceedings against the defaulting police officer. \\n</blockquote> \\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_16\\\">22.The Sessions District Judges should also be directed to impress upon the remand Magistrates not to routinely grant remand of accused to police officers seeking remand for accused if the pre-conditions for granting the remands mentioned in <a href=\\\"/doc/379145/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">sections 41(1)(b)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">41 A </a>Cr.P.C. are not disclosed in cases punishable with 7 year terms, or where the police officer appears to be seeking remand for an accused in a mala fide manner in the absence of concrete material. The issue of compliance with <a href=\\\"/doc/379145/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">sections 41(1)(b)</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">41 A </a>Cr.P.C and the directions of this Court in this regard may also be discussed in the monthly meetings of the District Judges with the administration and the superior police officials. \\n</blockquote> \\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_17\\\">23.We are also of the view that the Registrar General may issue a circular within a period of one month with directions to the Sessions Courts and Magistrates to monitor and oversee the applications for remand sought by the arresting police officers and to comply with the other directions mentioned herein above. \\n</blockquote> \\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_18\\\">25.As already indicated above we are of the view that by routinely mentioning in the case diary that a particular condition referred to in sections 41(1)(b) or 41 A <a href=\\\"/doc/445276/\\\" id=\\\"a_19\\\">Cr.P.C</a>. has been met for seeking police remand, would not provide adequate reason for effecting the arrest. The DGP is also directed to circulate the present order to all subordinate police officers. \\n</blockquote> \\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_17\\\">\\tWe have been pained to note that regularly petitions are filed where the offence committed would be for a lesser period then seven years or maximum punishment would be seven years and they routinely bring by way of writ petition scrap of  being arrested. The provision of Section 41-A were incorporated of this purpose only that  concerned who is not charged with heinous crime does not require and whose custody is not required may not face arrest. But we are pained that this provision has not met his avoid purpose. \\n</p> \\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_18\\\">27.Let a copy of this order be sent to the DGP, U.P., Member Secretary, U.P.
