It is the case of the petitioner that he is the owner of the\\naforesaid vehicle and it is duly registered with the transport department\\nof the Government.

The case of the prosecution is that on 13.12.2017, while\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">                                  Page 1 of 6</span>\\n         R/SCR.A/10437/2018                                  ORDER\\n\\n\\n\\nthe police personnels were on patrolling, they received a secret\\ninformation of the vehicle in question carrying liquor and when police\\nauthorities intercepted the same near Bhalej, on carrying out the search\\nof the said vehicle, its driver was found carrying liquor without any pass\\nor permit. Therefore, an FIR being Prohibition C.R.No.5186 of 2017\\ncame to be lodged with Bhalej Police Station under <a href=\\\"/doc/1830469/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Sections 65(a)(e)</a>,\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1226542/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">116</a>­B, 81 and 98(2) of the <a href=\\\"/doc/3446826/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">Gujarat Prohibition Act</a>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">5.

Learned Advocate for the petitioner has urged that this\\nCourt has wide powers, while exercising such powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Article 226</a>\\nof the Constitution. It can also take into account the ratio laid down in\\nthe case of <a href=\\\"/doc/25703131/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">&#x27;SUNDERBHAI AMBALAL DESAI VS.

This Court has also heard the learned APP and she has\\nurged this Court that the appropriate conditions be imposed, while\\nordering the release of the vehicle. She further pointed out that this\\nCourt (Coram: J.B. Pardiwala, J.) in the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/66197195/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">&#x27;ANILKUMAR RAMLAL\\n@ RAMANLALJI MEHTA VS.

STATE\\nOF GUJARAT</a>&#x27; in Special Criminal Application No. 8521 of 2017 and the\\nallied matters decided on 15.12.2017 has held that the powers of the\\nMagistrate to order interim release of the seized vehicle under Section\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">                                     Page 2 of 6</span>\\n          R/SCR.A/10437/2018                                       ORDER\\n\\n\\n\\n98(2) of the said Act has been curtailed, and therefore, the Courts below\\nhave been held to have no jurisdiction to order interim release of the\\nvehicle, pending trial, where, the vehicle is seized in connection with the\\noffence under the <a href=\\\"/doc/3446826/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Prohibition Act</a> and the quantity of the liquor seized\\nexceeds 10 liters. She, further, urged that, of course, powers of this Court\\nunder <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to order release of the vehicle can\\nbe exercised at any time, whenever the Court deems it appropriate. She\\nalso pointed out that the recent decision of this Court in Special Criminal\\nApplication No. 2185 of 2018, where, this Court, in exercise of the\\npowers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, has ordered the release of\\nthe vehicle, pending trial.

On thus hearing both the sides, without determining the\\nother issues raised by the petitioner, in reference to <a href=\\\"/doc/90856311/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Sections 98</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/57899988/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">99</a>\\nand other provisions of the said Act and reserving that to be determined\\nin future, in an appropriate proceedings being a contentious issue, this\\nCourt choses not to enter into that arena in the present matter and\\ninstead exercise the powers under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_15\\\">Articles 226</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1331149/\\\" id=\\\"a_16\\\">227</a> of the\\nConstitution.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">9.            This Court (Coram: J.B. Pardiwala, J.) however in the case\\nof in &#x27;ANILKUMAR RAMLAL @ RAMANLALJI MEHTA VS. STATE OF\\nGUJARAT&#x27; (Supra) in Special Criminal Application No. 2185 of 2018,\\nDated: 05.04.2018, has also returned the vehicle recently under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_17\\\">Articles\\n226</a> and <a href=\\\"/doc/1331149/\\\" id=\\\"a_18\\\">227</a> of the Constitution, exercising its powers to do that even at\\nan initial stage.\\n</p>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">                                     Page 3 of 6</span>\\n<pre id=\\\"pre_2\\\">         R/SCR.A/10437/2018                                        ORDER\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.1          It would be worthwhile to refer profitably at this stage to\\n</pre><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">the observations made by the Apex Court in &#x27;SUNDERBHAI AMBALAL\\nDESAI VS. STATE OF GUJARAT&#x27; (Supra), which read as under:\\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_2\\\">                     &quot;15.          Learned senior counsel Mr. Dholakia,\\n                     appearing for the State of Gujarat further submitted\\n                     that at present in the police station premises, number of\\n                     vehicles are kept unattended and vehicles become junk\\n                     day by day. It is his contention that appropriate\\n                     directions should be given to the Magistrates who are\\n                     dealing with such questions to hand over such vehicles\\n                     to its owner or to the person from whom the said\\n                     vehicles are seized by taking appropriate bond and the\\n                     guarantee for the return of the said vehicles if required\\n                     by the Court at any point of time.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_3\\\">                     16.           However, the learned counsel appearing for\\n                     the petitioners submitted that this question of handing\\n                     over vehicles to the person from whom it is seized or to\\n                     its true owner is always a matter of litigation and a lot\\n                     of arguments are advanced by the concerned persons.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_4\\\">                     17.           In our view, whatever be the situation, it is\\n                     of no use to keep such­seized vehicles at the police\\n                     stations for a long period. It is for the Magistrate to pass\\n                     appropriate orders immediately by taking appropriate\\n                     bond and guarantee as well as security for return of the\\n                     said vehicles, if required at any point of time. This can\\n                     be done pending hearing of applications for return of\\n                     such vehicles.&quot;\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">9.2          The Apex Court has, thus, directed that within a period of\\nsix months from the date of production of the vehicle before the Court\\nconcerned, needful be done. It even went to the extent of directing that\\nwhere the vehicle is not claimed by the accused, owner, or the insurance\\ncompany or by third person, then such vehicle may be ordered to be\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">                                    Page 4 of 6</span>\\n         R/SCR.A/10437/2018                                    ORDER\\n\\n\\n\\nauctioned by the Court. If the said vehicle is insured with the insurance\\ncompany then insurance company be informed by the Court to take\\npossession of the vehicle which is not claimed by the owner or a third\\nperson. If Insurance company fails to take possession, the vehicles may\\nbe sold as per the direction of the Court. The Court would pass such\\norder within a period of six months from the date of production of the\\nsaid vehicle before the Court. It also directed that before handing over\\npossession of such vehicles, appropriate photographs of the said vehicle\\nshould be taken and a detailed panchnama should also be prepared. The\\nApex Court also held and specifically directed that concerned Magistrate\\nwould take immediate action for seeing that powers under Section 451\\nof the Code are properly and promptly exercised and articles are not\\nkept for a long time at the police station, in any case, for not more than\\nfifteen days to one month. It, therefore, directed that this object can also\\nbe achieved if there is proper supervision by the Registry of the\\nconcerned High Court in seeing that the rules framed by the High Court\\nwith regard to such articles are implemented properly.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">10.
