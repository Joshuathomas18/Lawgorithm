The State is a\\n            virtuous litigant and looks with unconcern on\\n            immoral forensic successes so that if on the merits\\n            the case is weak, Government shows a willingness\\n            to settle the dispute regardless of prestige and\\n            other lesser motivations which move private parties\\n            to fight in court. The layout on litigation costs and\\n            executive time by the State and its agencies is so\\n            staggering these days because of the large amount\\n            of litigation in which it is involved that a positive\\n            and wholesome policy of cutting back on the\\n            volume of law suits by the twin methods of not\\n            being tempted into forensic showdowns where a\\n            reasonable adjustment is feasible and ever offering\\n\\n7   [(1974) 3 SCC 554 : 1974 SCC (L&amp;S) 89]\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_49\\\">                                    43</span>\\n\\n\\n      to extinguish a pending proceeding on just terms,\\n      giving the legal mentors of Government some\\n      initiative and authority in this behalf.

Though the State Government Officers failed to\\n\\nplace correct information for all these days about the status\\n\\nof the alleged vigilance enquiry, now it is clear by the\\n\\naffidavit filed by the 10th respondent (Central Government)\\n\\nand   the     statement     made        by   the   Chief   Secretary,\\n\\nGovernment of Andhra Pradesh, before the Court that the\\n\\nsaid vigilance enquiry is concluded on 26.10.2020.                The\\n\\nState Government at-least after completion of the vigilance\\n\\nenquiry ought to have made payments to the petitioners by\\n\\nclearing their bills.

The State Government informed the\\n\\nCentral Government that returning of the unused money will\\n\\nbe discussed with the State Finance Department and will be\\n\\nintimated to the Ministry of Central Government.

But,\\n\\nas per the observations recorded in the Labour Budget\\n\\nRevision meeting held on 31.08.2020, it is proved that the\\n\\nCentral   Government      released   funds   under   material\\n\\ncomponent liability to make payments to the petitioners.\\n\\nBut, the said amounts are not released in favour of the\\n\\npetitioners for which they are entitled.\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_85\\\">58)        The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\\n\\nsubmitted that in some cases works were executed under\\n\\nthe State Convergence Fund, Special Development Fund,\\n\\nRural Development Fund, Gram Panchayat General Fund/14th\\n\\nFinance Commission Fund and C.M.

Due to illegal action of non-payment of the\\n\\namounts promptly by clearing the bills submitted by the\\n\\npetitioners after execution of works, the petitioners could not\\n\\nfeed and look after the welfare of their family properly, they\\n\\ncould not make payments to employees/workers and they\\n\\ncould not make payments to the material procured and they\\n\\nhave to pay interests for the debts incurred by them for\\n\\nexecution of works.
