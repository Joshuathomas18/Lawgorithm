It is\\n\\nsubmitted that therefore, the Division Bench\\n\\nof the High Court has materially erred.

An\\n          increment that has accrued shall ordinarily\\n          be drawn as a matter of course unless it is\\n          withheld. An increment may be withheld\\n          from an employee by the competent\\n          authority, if his conduct has not been good,\\n          or his work has not been satisfactory. In\\n          ordering the withholding of an increment,\\n          the withholding authority shall state the\\n          period for which it is withheld, and whether\\n          the postponement shall have the effect of\\n          postponing future increments.”\\n\\n6.2   It is the case on behalf of the appellants that\\n\\n      the word used in Regulation 40(1) is that an\\n\\n      increment accrues from the day following that\\n\\n      on which it is earned and in the present case\\n\\n      the increment accrued on the day when they\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_19\\\">                                                         Page 12 of 28</span>\\n\\f      retired and therefore, on that day they were\\n\\n      not in service and therefore, not entitled to\\n\\n      the annual increment which they might have\\n\\n      earned one day earlier. It is also the case on\\n\\n      behalf of the appellants that as the increment\\n\\n      is in the form of incentive and therefore, when\\n\\n      the employees are not in service there is no\\n\\n      question     of   granting   them   any   annual\\n\\n      increment which as such is in the form of\\n\\n      incentive.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_19\\\">\\n<span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neutral\\\" data-docid=\\\"35017735\\\" id=\\\"span_20\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Neutral\\\" data-docid=\\\"54264578\\\" id=\\\"span_21\\\">6.3   At this stage, it is required to be noted that\\n\\n      there are divergent views of various High\\n\\n      Courts on the issue involved.
