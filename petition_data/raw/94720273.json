In this batch of petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of\\nIndia, the petitioners have assailed the impugned order passed u/S\\n148A(d) of the Income Tax Act(hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;) as\\nalso the notice      issued u/S 148 of the said Act for initiating re-\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">                                     2</span>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_3\\\">assessment proceedings u/S 147 of the Act for the Assessment Year\\n2013-14.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\">3.    The learned counsel for Revenue has raised a preliminary\\nobjection with regard to maintainability of the writ petition in view of\\nthe alternative remedy available u/S 246 of the Act of filing an appeal.\\nSince the objections have been raised in all the writ petitions mentioned\\nhereinabove, facts of W.P. No. 19516/2022 are taken for the purpose of\\ndeciding the objection.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">4.    In these writ petitions, jurisdictional issue has been raised by the\\npetitioners, therefore, in our prima-facie view, the question which is\\nrequired to be considered is :\\n</p><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_1\\\">      &quot; Whether under what circumstances, a challenge can\\n      be entertained to an order passed u/S 148A(d) of the\\n      Act, as it stood amended?&quot;\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Issue\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">5.    Since the jurisdictional issue has been raised before this Court,\\neven assuming an alternative remedy u/S 246 of the Act of filing an\\nappeal is available, it will not operate as an absolute bar for\\nentertaining the writ petition as jurisdictional issues goes to the root of\\nmatter and it is one of the exceptional factors carved out by the Hon&#x27;ble\\nSupreme Court for exercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Article 226</a> of the\\nConstitution of India.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"PARTY\\\" data-docid=\\\"45245768\\\" id=\\\"span_2\\\">6.

Since the Assessing Officer while passing the order has given an\\ninterpretation and held against the petitioners, therefore, necessity arises\\nfor this Court to consider the correctness of such finding, which finding\\ncannot be agitated before the Assessing Officer for re-assessment\\nproceedings.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"141023042\\\" id=\\\"span_4\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"78523641\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">9.

We do deem it open to\\n               examine this issue in the present case after having examined the notice\\n               u/S 148A(b), including annexure thereto, reply filed by the petitioner\\n               and the order under <a href=\\\"/doc/21606493/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">Section 148A(d)</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961.&quot;</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">               11.
