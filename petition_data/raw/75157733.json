Now the moot question is whether the rejection of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    the application by the District Magistrate can be held to be\\n\\n    contrary to law.    The answer to the same is always in\\n\\n    negative, for the simple reason that the convicts in the State\\n\\n    are released on parole under the provisions of <a href=\\\"/doc/101623343/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Section 3</a> &amp; <a href=\\\"/doc/104449407/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">4</a> of\\n\\n    the Act, where detailed procedure for such release has been\\n\\n    provided.

In case the District Magistrate, on his\\n\\n    inquiry, is satisfied that the release of convict is likely to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    endanger the security of the State or the maintenance of\\n\\n    public order, he may hold that the convict is not entitled to\\n\\n\\n    be released on parole.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"PetArg\\\" id=\\\"p_11\\\">    6.        Obviously, when such order is assailed, the Court\\n\\n\\n    would definitely look into the reasons accorded by the\\n\\n    Magistrate, rejecting the application. In the instant case, the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    District Magistrate based upon the inquiry held and report\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    submitted by the Superintendent of Police, has rejected the\\n\\n    claim of the petitioner. Firstly, on account of his conduct as\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    on an earlier occasion, the petitioner while on parole did not\\n\\n    surrender to the Jail authorities and remained absconded for\\n\\n    more than 10 years. Secondly, the Magistrate has also taken\\n\\n    into consideration the reports and the statement of the\\n\\n    complainant party, wherein they have objected to the\\n\\n    release of the petitioner on the ground of threat perception,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">                                           ::: Downloaded on - 14/03/2023 20:33:06 :::CIS</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">                                      5</span>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    because the petitioner along-with his six brothers was\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                                   .\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">    sentenced in a murder case.             That apart, even the police\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    authorities have expressed their apprehension in case the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    petitioner is released on parole, he would again jump the\\n\\n    same as is evident from the report of SDPO, Jawali, District\\n\\n    Kangra, H.P.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">    7.\\n\\n\\n                    It is more than settled that the grant of parole is not\\n\\n    a matter of right and is dependent on good conduct and\\n\\n\\n    also satisfying the other provisions of the <a href=\\\"/doc/136880097/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Himachal Pradesh\\n\\n    Good Conduct Prisoners (Temporary Release) Act, 1968</a> and\\n\\n\\n    the Rules framed thereunder.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">    8.
