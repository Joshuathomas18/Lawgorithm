The prosecution case appears to be that the police party\\nwhile on patrolling duty on 02.10.2019 at about 12.30 p.m. on\\nNandapur-Semiliguda          road    MDR-55,          spotted     one    full      body      twelve\\nwheeler     Truck        (Eicher)        bearing       No.EB-13-BD-5753            coming      from\\nNandapur side at a high speed and accordingly they chased and\\ndetained the truck at Bodenga Chhak and found three persons boarded\\nin the said truck including the driver.                       Eventually, 247 kg. Ganja\\nwas   recovered      from    the     truck.          The   petitioner        was    one   of   the\\noccupants of the truck and was arrested at the spot.                                He has been\\nin custody for more than three and a half years.                                   There are no\\ncriminal antecedents against the petitioner.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_11\\\">3.          We are informed that the trial has commenced but only 1\\nout of the 19 witnesses has been examined. The conclusion of trial\\nwill, thus, take some more time.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_12\\\">4.          As regard to the twin conditions contained in <a href=\\\"/doc/496325/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section 37</a>\\nof the NDPS Act, learned counsel for the respondent – State has\\nbeen duly heard.          Thus, the 1st condition stands complied with.                          So\\nfar as the 2nd condition re: formation of opinion as to whether\\nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that the petitioner is not\\nguilty, the same may not be formed at this stage when he has\\nalready spent more than three and a half years in custody. The\\nprolonged    incarceration,              generally         militates     against       the     most\\nprecious    fundamental       right        guaranteed         under     <a href=\\\"/doc/1199182/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Article      21</a>   of    the\\nConstitution and in such a situation, the conditional liberty must\\noverride the statutory embargo created under <a href=\\\"/doc/1199025/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">Section 37(1)(b)(ii)</a>\\nof the NDPS Act.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_13\\\">5.          However, we find some merit in the contention of learned\\ncounsel for the respondent – State that the petitioner being not a\\nresident of the State of Orissa, some stringent conditions are\\nrequired to be imposed upon him.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_14\\\">6.          Consequently, while directing that the petitioner shall\\nbe    released      on    bail      on     his       furnishing       bail     bonds      to   the\\nsatisfaction of the Trial Court, it is directed that he shall be\\nrequired to produce two local sureties before the Trial Court. The\\npetitioner shall also appear before the Trial Court on every date\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">\\f                                       3</span>\\n\\nof hearing.    In case he absents himself, it shall be taken as a\\nmisuse of concession of bail granted to him today by this Court.\\nOrdered accordingly.\\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_15\\\">7.
