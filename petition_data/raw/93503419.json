While granting ad interim protection the three factors weighed\\nwith us, those were:-\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_11\\\">      (i)    That it was a cross case arising out of civil dispute.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_12\\\">      (ii)   Prima    facie      there   was   no    material       to   show    that    the\\n      provisions       of     <a href=\\\"/doc/25085007/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Scheduled        Castes     and       Scheduled      Tribes\\n      (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989</a>, were invoked.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<blockquote id=\\\"blockquote_13\\\">      (iii) That the incident was alleged to have been taken place\\n      on 17.02.2022 and the FIR was lodged on 23.02.2022, as such\\n      there was a delay of six days in lodging the FIR.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_3\\\">3.

Shri    Pande, learned counsel, vehemently opposes the petition.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">5.    However, as stated hereinabove, we, prima facie, find that the\\npetitionerâ€™s custodial interrogation would not be necessary for the\\noffenes alleged with.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1920437\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">6.    One more factor that needs to be noted is that the High Court,\\nby an order running into 13 pages, has rejected the application.\\nThis Court has consistently right from the case of <a href=\\\"/doc/1920437/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">Niranjan Singh\\nand Another v. Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and Others</a>, (1980) 2 SCC\\n559, held that detailed elaboration of evidence has to be avoided\\nat the stage of grant/rejection of bail/anticipatory bail.                             We do\\nnot   appreciate      such   a   lengthy   elaboration         of   evidence      at    this\\nstage.</span>\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">7.    Another factor that needs to be noted is that though the order\\nwas reserved on 25.01.2023, the learned Single Judge of the High\\nCourt has pronounced the order on 01.03.2023 i.e. after a period of\\n\\fone month and one week.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\">8.    It is always said that in the matters pertaining to liberty of\\ncitizens, the Court should act promptly.      In our view, such an\\ninordinate delay in passing an order pertaining to liberty of a\\ncitizen is not in tune with the constitutional mandate.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_9\\\">9.    Therefore, we are inclined to allow this petition.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_10\\\">10.   The order dated 24.03.2023, passed by this Court, is made\\nabsolute.
