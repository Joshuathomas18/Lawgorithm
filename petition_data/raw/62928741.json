It   appears     on    a   perusal     of    the    order    under\\n\\nchallenge     in   this      appeal    that       the    appellant      had\\n\\nquestioned the jurisdiction of the Deputy Excise and\\n\\nTaxation Commissioner (ST)-cum-Revisional Authority,\\n\\nKurukshetra       (hereafter       ‘the   Revisional        Authority’,\\n\\nfor short) to reopen proceedings, in exercise of suo\\n\\nmotu revisional power conferred by <a href=\\\"/doc/21240239/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">section 34</a> of the\\n\\nVAT Act, and to pass final orders holding that the\\n\\ntwo assessment orders, both dated 28th                          February,\\n\\n2007    passed     by    the      ETO-cum-Assessing             Authority,\\n\\nKurukshetra (hereafter ‘the Assessing Authority’, for\\n\\nshort) for the assessment years 2003-04 and 2004-05\\n\\nsuffered      from      illegality          and     impropriety         as\\n\\ndelineated therein, viz. that the Assessing Authority\\n\\nerred in levying tax on mosquito repellant (a product\\n\\nmanufactured by the appellant) @ 4% instead of 10%.\\n\\nKeeping in view the objection raised by counsel for\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_8\\\">\\f                            3</span>\\n\\n\\nthe respondents that without exhausting the remedy of\\n\\nappeal provided by <a href=\\\"/doc/164128100/\\\" id=\\\"a_5\\\">section 33</a> of the VAT Act “it\\n\\nwould not be permissible to entertain this petition”\\n\\nand upon consideration of the decision of this Court\\n\\nreported in (1975) 2 SCC 436 (Titagarh Paper Mills\\n\\nvs. Orissa State Electricity Board &amp; Anr.) based on\\n\\nwhich it was contended on their behalf that where any\\n\\nright or liberty arises under a particular Act then\\n\\nthe   remedy    available   under   that      Act    has    to   be\\n\\navailed, the High Court was of the opinion that there\\n\\ncan be no presumption that the appellate authority\\n\\nwould not be able to grant relief sought in the writ\\n\\npetition; hence, the writ petition was dismissed and\\n\\nthe   appellants    were    relegated    to    the     appellate\\n\\nremedy.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"RespArg\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">4.    Before answering the questions, we feel the urge\\n\\nto say a few words on the exercise of writ powers\\n\\nconferred by <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_6\\\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution having\\n\\ncome across certain orders passed by the high courts\\n\\nholding writ petitions as “not maintainable” merely\\n\\nbecause   the    alternative    remedy     provided        by    the\\n\\nrelevant statutes has not been pursued by the parties\\n\\ndesirous of invocation of the writ jurisdiction. The\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_9\\\">\\f                               4</span>\\n\\n\\npower to issue prerogative writs under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_7\\\">Article 226</a> is\\n\\nplenary in nature. Any limitation on the exercise of\\n\\nsuch   power    must    be   traceable          in    the     Constitution\\n\\nitself. Profitable reference in this regard may be\\n\\nmade   to     <a href=\\\"/doc/1797219/\\\" id=\\\"a_8\\\">Article    329</a>        and    ordainments            of     other\\n\\nsimilarly      worded    articles          in        the     Constitution.\\n\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_9\\\">Article 226</a> does not, in terms, impose any limitation\\n\\nor restraint on the exercise of power to issue writs.\\n\\nWhile it is true that exercise of writ powers despite\\n\\navailability of a remedy under the very statute which\\n\\nhas been invoked and has given rise to the action\\n\\nimpugned in the writ petition ought not to be made in\\n\\na   routine    manner,       yet,    the    mere           fact   that    the\\n\\npetitioner before the high court, in a given case,\\n\\nhas not pursued the alternative remedy available to\\n\\nhim/it cannot mechanically be construed as a ground\\n\\nfor its dismissal. It is axiomatic that the high\\n\\ncourts (bearing in mind the facts of each particular\\n\\ncase) have a discretion whether to entertain a writ\\n\\npetition or not. One of the self-imposed restrictions\\n\\non the exercise of power under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_10\\\">Article 226</a> that has\\n\\nevolved through judicial precedents is that the high\\n\\ncourts should normally not entertain a writ petition,\\n\\nwhere an effective and efficacious alternative remedy\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_10\\\">\\f                                          5</span>\\n\\n\\nis available. At the same time, it must be remembered\\n\\nthat mere availability of an alternative remedy of\\n\\nappeal    or     revision,            which       the    party       invoking         the\\n\\njurisdiction of the high court under <a href=\\\"/doc/1712542/\\\" id=\\\"a_11\\\">Article 226</a> has\\n\\nnot pursued, would not oust the jurisdiction of the\\n\\nhigh     court        and        render          a      writ        petition      “not\\n\\nmaintainable”.          In       a    long       line     of    decisions, this\\n\\nCourt    has     made       it       clear      that     availability            of   an\\n\\nalternative remedy does not operate as an absolute\\n\\nbar to the “maintainability” of a writ petition and\\n\\nthat the rule, which requires a party to pursue the\\n\\nalternative remedy provided by a statute, is a rule\\n\\nof policy, convenience and discretion rather than a\\n\\nrule    of     law.     Though         elementary,             it    needs       to   be\\n\\nrestated              that                    “entertainability”                      and\\n\\n“maintainability”            of       a       writ petition          are    distinct\\n\\nconcepts. The fine but real distinction between the\\n\\ntwo ought not to be lost sight of. The objection as\\n\\nto “maintainability” goes to the root of the matter\\n\\nand if such objection were found to be of substance,\\n\\nthe     courts    would          be       rendered        incapable         of    even\\n\\nreceiving      the     lis       for          adjudication.          On    the   other\\n\\nhand, the question of “entertainability” is entirely\\n\\nwithin the realm of discretion of the high courts,\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_11\\\">\\f                               6</span>\\n\\n\\nwrit    remedy    being   discretionary.      A    writ   petition\\n\\ndespite being maintainable may not be entertained by\\n\\na high court for very many reasons or relief could\\n\\neven be refused to the petitioner, despite setting up\\n\\na sound legal point, if grant of the claimed relief\\n\\nwould not further public interest. Hence, dismissal\\n\\nof a writ petition by a high court on the ground that\\n\\nthe petitioner has not availed the alternative remedy\\n\\nwithout, however, examining whether an exceptional\\n\\ncase has been made out for such entertainment would\\n\\nnot be proper.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"1590667\\\" id=\\\"span_12\\\">5.     A little after the dawn of the Constitution, a\\n\\nConstitution      Bench   of   this   Court   in    its   decision\\n\\nreported in 1958 SCR 595 (<a href=\\\"/doc/1590667/\\\" id=\\\"a_12\\\">State of Uttar Pradesh vs.\\n\\nMohd.

In the next place it must be borne in mind\\n       that there is no rule, with regard to certiorari as\\n       there is with mandamus, that it will lie only where\\n       there is no other equally effective remedy. It is\\n       well established that, provided the requisite\\n       grounds exist, certiorari will lie although a right\\n       of   appeal   has    been   conferred   by   statute,\\n       (Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 11, p.\\n       130 and the cases cited there). The fact that the\\n       aggrieved party has another and adequate remedy may\\n       be taken into consideration by the superior court\\n       in arriving at a conclusion as to whether it\\n       should, in exercise of its discretion, issue a writ\\n       of   certiorari   to   quash   the  proceedings   and\\n       decisions of inferior courts subordinate to it and\\n       ordinarily the superior court will decline to\\n       interfere until the aggrieved party has exhausted\\n       his other statutory remedies, if any. But this rule\\n       requiring the exhaustion of statutory remedies\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_13\\\">\\f                                 7</span>\\n\\n\\n     before the writ will be granted is a rule of\\n     policy, convenience and discretion rather than a\\n     rule of law and instances are numerous where a writ\\n     of certiorari has been issued in spite of the fact\\n     that the aggrieved party had other adequate legal\\n     remedies. ***”\\n\\n\\n\\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_8\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"172383107\\\" id=\\\"span_14\\\">6.   At the end of the last century, this Court in\\n\\nparagraph 15 of the its decision reported in (1998) 8\\n\\nSCC 1 (<a href=\\\"/doc/172383107/\\\" id=\\\"a_13\\\">Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade\\n\\nMarks, Mumbai and Others</a>) carved out the exceptions\\n\\non   the    existence     whereof          a   Writ Court     would    be\\n\\njustified in entertaining a writ petition despite the\\n\\nparty      approaching      it       not       having     availed     the\\n\\nalternative remedy provided by the statute.

That apart, we may also usefully refer to the\\n\\ndecisions of this Court reported in (1977) 2 SCC 724\\n\\n(State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; ors. vs. Indian Hume Pipe\\n\\nCo. Ltd.) and (2000) 10 SCC 482 (<a href=\\\"/doc/1663246/\\\" id=\\\"a_14\\\">Union of India vs.\\n\\nState of Haryana</a>). What appears on a plain reading of\\n\\nthe former decision is that whether a certain item\\n\\nfalls within an entry in a sales tax statute, raises\\n\\na pure question of law and if investigation into\\n\\nfacts is unnecessary, the high court could entertain\\n\\na writ petition in its discretion even though the\\n\\nalternative remedy was not availed of; and, unless\\n\\nexercise of discretion is shown to be unreasonable or\\n\\nperverse,    this   Court     would    not   interfere.   In   the\\n\\nlatter decision, this Court found the issue raised by\\n\\nthe   appellant     to   be       pristinely   legal   requiring\\n\\ndetermination by the high court without putting the\\n\\nappellant through the mill of statutory appeals in\\n\\nthe hierarchy. What follows from the said decisions\\n\\nis that where the controversy is a purely legal one\\n\\nand it does not involve disputed questions of fact\\n\\nbut only questions of law, then it should be decided\\n\\nby the high court instead of dismissing the writ\\n\\npetition on the ground of an alternative remedy being\\n\\navailable.</span>\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_17\\\">\\f                                    9</span><p data-structure=\\\"Section\\\" id=\\\"p_12\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_13\\\">9.     Now, reverting to the facts of this appeal, we\\n\\nfind that the appellant had claimed before the High\\n\\nCourt that the suo motu revisional power could not\\n\\nhave been exercised by the Revisional Authority in\\n\\nview of the existing facts and circumstances leading\\n\\nto the only conclusion that the assessment orders\\n\\nwere    legally       correct       and     that     the     final      orders\\n\\nimpugned     in      the     writ       petition     were      passed     upon\\n\\nassuming       a     jurisdiction            which      the      Revisional\\n\\nAuthority      did     not    possess.          In   fine,     the      orders\\n\\nimpugned     were     passed        wholly      without      jurisdiction.\\n\\nSince    a   jurisdictional             issue     was    raised      by    the\\n\\nappellant in the writ petition questioning the very\\n\\ncompetence of the Revisional Authority to exercise\\n\\nsuo motu power, being a pure question of law, we are\\n\\nof the considered view that the plea raised in the\\n\\nwrit petition did deserve a consideration on merits\\n\\nand the appellant’s writ petition ought not to have\\n\\nbeen thrown out at the threshold.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_14\\\">10.

Such\\n\\nagreement       contained          an    arbitration     agreement        in\\n\\nclause     23.

It     is,    therefore,      clear       that   because    of   the\\n\\nspecific entry dealing with mosquito repellents, this\\n\\nCourt held ‘Jet Mat’ to be covered under Entry 129.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_39\\\">32. As      the     Tribunal      in     its     order     dated     21st\\n\\nNovember, 2001 found, there was no such corresponding\\n\\nentry in the <a href=\\\"/doc/136120680/\\\" id=\\\"a_39\\\">VAT Act</a>. Bearing in mind the same as\\n\\nwell as on consideration of a decision of the Madras\\n\\nHigh   Court      and   other    decisions,      the     Tribunal    had\\n\\nproceeded to hold that mosquito repellents containing\\n\\n4% ‘Alethrin’ was an insecticide and hence, liable to\\n\\nconcessional rate of tax.\\n</p>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_40\\\">33. While        deciding     the      present       appeal,    we   are\\n\\nprimarily concerned with the issue of assumption of\\n\\njurisdiction by the Revisional Authority on the face\\n\\nof the unchallenged order of the Tribunal dated 21 st\\n\\nNovember,      2001,    and     not    with    the    merits    of   the\\n\\ndecision    either      given    by    the     Tribunal    or   by   the\\n\\nRevisional Authority. What stares at the face of the\\n\\nrespondents is that the aforesaid decision of the\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_39\\\">\\f                                25</span>\\n\\n\\nTribunal,       quoted    in    the    order        of    the     Assessing\\n\\nAuthority,       has    attained      finality.          Once    the    issue\\n\\nstands     finally      concluded,      the    decision          binds       the\\n\\nState,     a    fortiori,      the    Revisional         Authority.          The\\n\\ndecision of the Tribunal may not be acceptable to the\\n\\nRevisional      Authority,      but    that    cannot           furnish      any\\n\\nground     to   such     authority     to     perceive          that    it    is\\n\\neither not bound by the same or that it need not be\\n\\nfollowed. The first proviso, in such a case, gets\\n\\nactivated and would operate as a bar to the exercise\\n\\nof powers by the Revisional Authority.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_41\\\"><span class=\\\"citetext\\\" data-sentiment=\\\"Pos\\\" data-docid=\\\"13265\\\" id=\\\"span_40\\\">34. In our view, the Revisional Authority might have\\n\\nbeen justified in exercising suo motu power to revise\\n\\nthe order of the Assessing Authority had the decision\\n\\nof   the   Tribunal      been    set    aside       or    its     operation\\n\\nstayed     by   a   competent        Court.    So    long        it    is    not\\n\\ndisputed that the Tribunal’s decision, having regard\\n\\nto the framework of classification of products/tax\\n\\nliability        then     existing,         continues           to     remain\\n\\noperative and such framework too continues to remain\\n\\noperative when the impugned revisional orders were\\n\\nmade, the Revisional Authority was left with no other\\n\\nchoice but to follow the decision of the Tribunal\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_41\\\">\\f                                  26</span>\\n\\n\\nwithout    any    reservation.         Unless        the    discipline      of\\n\\nadhering to decisions made by the higher authorities\\n\\nis     maintained,        there    would        be    utter        chaos     in\\n\\nadministration        of     tax       laws      apart        from        undue\\n\\nharassment to assesses.

In the midst of hearing, we had enquired from\\n\\nMr. Sangwan whether there has been any decision of\\n\\nany other competent Tribunal or High Court taking a\\n\\nview different from the one taken by the Tribunal in\\n\\nits    order     dated     21st    November,          2001,       which     was\\n\\nconsidered     by    the    Assessing      Authority.             Fairly,   he\\n\\nanswered in the negative. If only Mr. Sangwan could\\n\\nhave    invited     our    attention       to    any       such    decision,\\n\\nwhich were acceptable to us, the issue decided by the\\n\\nTribunal could have been reopened on the ground that\\n\\nit is a debatable issue and interference with the\\n\\nfinal orders passed by the Revisional Authority may\\n\\nnot have been resorted to, leaving the appellant to\\n\\npursue the appellate remedy under the <a href=\\\"/doc/136120680/\\\" id=\\\"a_41\\\">VAT Act</a>.\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_43\\\">36.

A decision may be questioned as suffering from\\n\\nan illegality if its maker fails to understand the\\n\\nlaw     that    regulates        his     decision        making    power\\n\\ncorrectly or if he fails to give effect to any law\\n\\nthat holds the field and binds the parties. On the\\n\\nother hand, having regard to the purpose <a href=\\\"/doc/21240239/\\\" id=\\\"a_43\\\">section 34</a>\\n\\nseeks to serve, to take exception to a decision on\\n\\nthe ground of lack of propriety of any proceedings or\\n\\norder    passed      in   such    proceedings,       it    essentially\\n\\nought to relate to a procedural impropriety. It is\\n\\nincumbent for the accuser to show that the decision\\n\\nmaker has failed to observe the standard procedures\\n\\napplicable      in    case       of    exercise     of     his    power.\\n\\nAdditionally, to impeach an order on the ground of\\n\\nmoral impropriety, it has to be shown that the weight\\n\\nof      facts     together        with    the       applicable      law\\n\\noverwhelmingly points to one course of action but the\\n\\ndecision has surprisingly gone the other way, giving\\n\\nreason to suspect misbehaviour or misconduct in the\\n\\nsphere of activity of the decision maker warranting a\\n\\nrevision.\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_43\\\">\\f                                    28</span><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_45\\\">\\n\\n\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_46\\\">38. There is nothing on record to justify either\\n\\nillegality or (procedural/moral) impropriety in the\\n\\nproceedings        before     the     Assessing        Authority         or   the\\n\\norders passed by him, as such. As noted above, the\\n\\nAssessing Authority was bound by the order of the\\n\\nTribunal and elected to follow it having no other\\n\\noption.      Such      decision       of   the        Tribunal      was       even\\n\\nbinding      on     the       Revisional         Authority.         In        such\\n\\ncircumstances, to brand the orders of the Assessing\\n\\nAuthority         as        suffering          from        illegality          and\\n\\nimpropriety appears to us to be not only unjustified\\n\\nbut also demonstrates thorough lack of understanding\\n\\nof   the    principle        regulating         exercise      of    suo       motu\\n\\nrevisional power by a quasi-judicial authority apart\\n\\nfrom being in breach of the principle of judicial\\n\\ndiscipline, while confronted with orders passed by a\\n\\nsuperior Tribunal/Court.
