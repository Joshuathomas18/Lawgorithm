The petitioner seeks enlargement on regular bail in FIR\\n     No.325/2020,            dated    23.06.2020,    under   <a href=\\\"/doc/704277/\\\" id=\\\"a_1\\\">Sections   8</a>    and   <a href=\\\"/doc/919170/\\\" id=\\\"a_2\\\">20</a>   of   the\\n     Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short,\\n     `the Act’) registered at Police Station Jhunsi, District Pryagraj,\\n     Uttar Pradesh.\\n</p><span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_1\\\">Signature Not Verified</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_2\\\">Digitally signed by</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_3\\\">satish kumar yadav</span>\\n<p data-structure=\\\"Facts\\\" id=\\\"p_2\\\">     2.\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_4\\\">Date: 2023.01.25</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_5\\\">17:46:58 IST</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_6\\\">Reason:</span>\\n                         The allegations are that on a secret information, the\\n     police authorities intercepted two vehicles on 23.06.2020 i.e.                          one\\n     `Gray’ coloured `Honda City’ Car and the second `White’ coloured\\n     `Swift Dzire’ Car.               On an interrogation at the spot, Praveen Maurya\\n<span class=\\\"hidden_text\\\" id=\\\"span_7\\\">\\f                                                                                            2</span>\\n\\n@ Puneet Maurya, Rishab Kumar Maurya and Dheeraj Kumar Shukla were\\nfound    to    be       occupants    of     the    `Honda   City’     Car    whereas     the\\npetitioner was driving the `Swife Dzire’ Car.                    On taking a search,\\nmore than 92 kgs. Ganja was allegedly recovered from `Honda City’\\nCar whereas more than 65 kgs. Ganja was recovered from `Swift\\nDzire’ Car.         The accused were arrested at the spot. The petitioner\\nis, thus, in custody since 24.06.2020.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"CDiscource\\\" id=\\\"p_3\\\">3.            It appears that some of the occupants of the `Honda City’\\nCar   including         Praveen     Maurya    @    Puneet   Maurya    have    since      been\\nreleased on regular bail.              It is true that the quantity recovered\\nfrom the petitioner is commercial in nature and the provisions of\\n<a href=\\\"/doc/496325/\\\" id=\\\"a_3\\\">Section 37</a> of the Act may ordinarily be attracted.                      However, in the\\nabsence of criminal antecedents and the fact that the petitioner is\\nin custody for the last two and a half years, we are satisfied that\\nthe conditions of <a href=\\\"/doc/496325/\\\" id=\\\"a_4\\\">Section 37</a> of the Act can be dispensed with at\\nthis stage, more so when the trial is yet to commence though the\\ncharges have been framed.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_4\\\">4.            For the reasons stated above but without expressing any\\nviews on the merits of the case, the petitioner is directed to be\\nreleased      on    bail    subject    to    his    furnishing   bail       bonds   to   the\\nsatisfaction of the Trial Court.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Precedent\\\" id=\\\"p_5\\\">5.            It is made clear that in addition to the conditions that\\nmay be imposed by the Trial Court, the petitioner shall be required\\nto appear before the Trial Court on every date of hearing. In case\\nthe petitioner is found to be involved in future in any other\\nsimilar case, the respondent – State shall be at liberty to seek\\ncancellation of bail granted to him by this Court.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_6\\\">6.            The Special Leave Petition stands disposed in the above\\nterms.\\n</p><p data-structure=\\\"Conclusion\\\" id=\\\"p_7\\\">7.
