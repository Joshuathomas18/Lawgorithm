By\n\nway of the impugned judgment, the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan\n\nMunicipality and the concerned authority in Ranaghat and Habra\n\nMunicipalities were directed to consider the application made by the\n\nWrit Petitioners seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court also identified the scheme in light of\n\nwhich the said applications would have to be considered and decided.\n\nHence the present appeals by the State of West Bengal.\n\n\n2.10. The pertinent findings of the Division Bench of the High Court of\n\nCalcutta, in the common impugned judgment dated 30th September,\n\n2019, have been culled out hereinunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> i.   The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the argument\n\n      canvassed on behalf of the Government that there was an undue\n\n      delay between the time of making the application and the time\n\n      when the Respondents-Writ Petitioners approached the Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n\n      That the Writ Petitioners had not delayed filing applications\n\n      seeking appointments on compassionate grounds and the\n\n      concerned authorities had undertaken an enquiry by constituting\n\n      a committee but had ultimately taken years to consider their\n\n      applications and to recommend their respective names. The\n\n      Director of Local Bodies kept the matter pending without\n\n      according any approval of the recommendations, as a result, a\n\n      Writ Petition was filed which was disposed of with a specific\n\n      direction to the Director of Local Bodies to consider the\n\n      applications within a time frame. That in pursuance of the High\n\n      Court direction, the Director of Local Bodies disposed of the\n\n      matter in respect of Burdwan Municipality only on 16th October,\n\n      2015. Hence, a time of about ten years had been spent only for\n\n      processing the applications and such a delay could not be\n\n      attributed to the Respondents-Writ Petitioners.\n\nii.   That an employee of a municipality cannot be treated as an\n\n      employee of the State Government and therefore the scheme\n\n      available to a State Government employee cannot be extended to\n\n      a dependent of an employee of the municipality who died in\n\n      harness. Thus, the respondents were not entitled to claim the\n\n      benefit of compassionate appointment in terms of the schemes\n\n      formulated vide Circular No. 97-Emp.; 142-Emp.; 30-Emp.; and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                     8</span>\n\n\n       251-Emp., which were specifically applicable to State Government\n\n       employees.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">iii.   As to the issue of whether there was any scheme for grant of\n\n       compassionate    appointments     in   respect    of     employees   of\n\n       Municipalities, the Division Bench differed from the findings of the\n\n       Single Judge. On a conjoint reading of Circular Nos. 301-Emp.,\n\n       302-Emp. and 303 Emp., it was observed that it was clear that\n\n       the aforesaid Circulars were specific schemes for compassionate\n\n       appointments in respect of municipalities. That the said schemes\n\n       were in respect of all establishments covered under the <a href=\"/doc/92054927/\" id=\"a_3\">West\n\n       Bengal   Regulation    of   Recruitment   in     State    Government\n\n       Establishments and Establishments of Public Undertakings,\n\n       Statutory Bodies, Government Companies and Local Authorities\n\n       Act, 1999</a> (West Bengal Act XIV of 1999) (hereinafter referred to as\n\n       the ‘Act of 1999’ for the sake of brevity). That the said circulars\n\n       which were extended to the employees of all establishments\n\n       including local authorities like municipalities, were neither\n\n       withdrawn nor substituted by the subsequent notifications and\n\n       circulars.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">iv.    That although Circular No. 142-Emp. clarified that 97-Emp. was\n\n       applicable only in respect of State Government employees and\n\n       directed the municipalities to formulate their own schemes for\n\n       compassionate    appointment,     no   such      scheme     had   been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                  9</span>\n\n\n     formulated by the concerned municipalities. That it was evident\n\n     from Circular No. 142-Emp. that it does not withdraw the scheme\n\n     for compassionate appointment available under Circular Nos.\n\n     301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp. and in the absence of any\n\n     subsequent scheme or specific withdrawal of the existing scheme,\n\n     the scheme remains in subsistence and will be the scheme under\n\n     which the applications for compassionate appointments made by\n\n     the respondents are to be considered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">v.   In the absence of a substituted scheme, and given that Circular\n\n     No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were not specifically\n\n     withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable. Therefore,\n\n     compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities would be\n\n     governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp.\n\n     and 303-Emp.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          In light of the aforesaid observations, the Division Bench of\n\n     the High Court set aside the Order passed by the Single Judge\n\n     and directed the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan Division,\n\n     Government of West Bengal to reconsider the Memo dated 12th\n\n     June, 2013 whereby the Chairman, Burdwan Municipality, had\n\n     sought for the approval of recommended names for being\n\n     appointed under compassionate grounds. Further, the Director of\n\n     Local Bodies was directed to examine whether proper inspection\n\n     of the documents had been carried out while recommending such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                   10</span>\n\n\n     names and whether the parameters mentioned under the scheme\n\n     contained in Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp.\n\n     had been properly adhered to by the officials of Burdwan\n\n     Municipality while making the recommendation.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           Aggrieved by the said directions of the High Court and the\n\n     findings as to the eligibility of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners to\n\n     seek appointment on compassionate grounds, the present appeals\n\n     have been filed by the State of West Bengal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">3.   We have heard Sri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel and\n\nlearned counsel, Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Appellant-State of West Bengal and learned counsel Sri Indradeep\n\nPal for the Respondent-Writ Petitioners, and perused the material on\n\nrecord.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\nSubmissions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">4.

It was further submitted that directing at such a belated stage,\n\nthat the Respondents-Writ Petitioners ought to be appointed on\n\ncompassionate grounds would have no redeeming purpose.

Aggrieved by the Order passed by the Single Judge dated 5th July,\n\n2018, the Respondents- Writ Petitioners preferred a batch of appeals\n\nbefore the Division Bench of the High Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10390840\" id=\"span_10\">The said appeals were\n\nheard and allowed by a common impugned judgement dated 30th\n\nSeptember, 2019, passed in MAT 859 of 2018 with CAN 6137 of 2018\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/10390840/\" id=\"a_2\">Debabrata Tiwari vs. The State of West Bengal</a>. By\n\nway of the impugned judgment, the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan\n\nMunicipality and the concerned authority in Ranaghat and Habra\n\nMunicipalities were directed to consider the application made by the\n\nWrit Petitioners seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court also identified the scheme in light of\n\nwhich the said applications would have to be considered and decided.\n\nHence the present appeals by the State of West Bengal.\n\n\n2.10. The pertinent findings of the Division Bench of the High Court of\n\nCalcutta, in the common impugned judgment dated 30th September,\n\n2019, have been culled out hereinunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> i.   The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the argument\n\n      canvassed on behalf of the Government that there was an undue\n\n      delay between the time of making the application and the time\n\n      when the Respondents-Writ Petitioners approached the Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n\n      That the Writ Petitioners had not delayed filing applications\n\n      seeking appointments on compassionate grounds and the\n\n      concerned authorities had undertaken an enquiry by constituting\n\n      a committee but had ultimately taken years to consider their\n\n      applications and to recommend their respective names. The\n\n      Director of Local Bodies kept the matter pending without\n\n      according any approval of the recommendations, as a result, a\n\n      Writ Petition was filed which was disposed of with a specific\n\n      direction to the Director of Local Bodies to consider the\n\n      applications within a time frame. That in pursuance of the High\n\n      Court direction, the Director of Local Bodies disposed of the\n\n      matter in respect of Burdwan Municipality only on 16th October,\n\n      2015. Hence, a time of about ten years had been spent only for\n\n      processing the applications and such a delay could not be\n\n      attributed to the Respondents-Writ Petitioners.\n\nii.   That an employee of a municipality cannot be treated as an\n\n      employee of the State Government and therefore the scheme\n\n      available to a State Government employee cannot be extended to\n\n      a dependent of an employee of the municipality who died in\n\n      harness. Thus, the respondents were not entitled to claim the\n\n      benefit of compassionate appointment in terms of the schemes\n\n      formulated vide Circular No. 97-Emp.; 142-Emp.; 30-Emp.; and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                     8</span>\n\n\n       251-Emp., which were specifically applicable to State Government\n\n       employees.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">iii.   As to the issue of whether there was any scheme for grant of\n\n       compassionate    appointments     in   respect    of     employees   of\n\n       Municipalities, the Division Bench differed from the findings of the\n\n       Single Judge. On a conjoint reading of Circular Nos. 301-Emp.,\n\n       302-Emp. and 303 Emp., it was observed that it was clear that\n\n       the aforesaid Circulars were specific schemes for compassionate\n\n       appointments in respect of municipalities. That the said schemes\n\n       were in respect of all establishments covered under the <a href=\"/doc/92054927/\" id=\"a_3\">West\n\n       Bengal   Regulation    of   Recruitment   in     State    Government\n\n       Establishments and Establishments of Public Undertakings,\n\n       Statutory Bodies, Government Companies and Local Authorities\n\n       Act, 1999</a> (West Bengal Act XIV of 1999) (hereinafter referred to as\n\n       the ‘Act of 1999’ for the sake of brevity). That the said circulars\n\n       which were extended to the employees of all establishments\n\n       including local authorities like municipalities, were neither\n\n       withdrawn nor substituted by the subsequent notifications and\n\n       circulars.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">iv.    That although Circular No. 142-Emp. clarified that 97-Emp. was\n\n       applicable only in respect of State Government employees and\n\n       directed the municipalities to formulate their own schemes for\n\n       compassionate    appointment,     no   such      scheme     had   been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                  9</span>\n\n\n     formulated by the concerned municipalities. That it was evident\n\n     from Circular No. 142-Emp. that it does not withdraw the scheme\n\n     for compassionate appointment available under Circular Nos.\n\n     301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp. and in the absence of any\n\n     subsequent scheme or specific withdrawal of the existing scheme,\n\n     the scheme remains in subsistence and will be the scheme under\n\n     which the applications for compassionate appointments made by\n\n     the respondents are to be considered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">v.   In the absence of a substituted scheme, and given that Circular\n\n     No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were not specifically\n\n     withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable. Therefore,\n\n     compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities would be\n\n     governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp.\n\n     and 303-Emp.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          In light of the aforesaid observations, the Division Bench of\n\n     the High Court set aside the Order passed by the Single Judge\n\n     and directed the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan Division,\n\n     Government of West Bengal to reconsider the Memo dated 12th\n\n     June, 2013 whereby the Chairman, Burdwan Municipality, had\n\n     sought for the approval of recommended names for being\n\n     appointed under compassionate grounds. Further, the Director of\n\n     Local Bodies was directed to examine whether proper inspection\n\n     of the documents had been carried out while recommending such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                   10</span>\n\n\n     names and whether the parameters mentioned under the scheme\n\n     contained in Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp.\n\n     had been properly adhered to by the officials of Burdwan\n\n     Municipality while making the recommendation.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           Aggrieved by the said directions of the High Court and the\n\n     findings as to the eligibility of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners to\n\n     seek appointment on compassionate grounds, the present appeals\n\n     have been filed by the State of West Bengal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">3.

That a\n\ndirection to act on the same now, i.e., 17-18 years after the applications\n\nseeking compassionate appointment were made, would not further the\n\nobject of a scheme of compassionate appointment.\n\n\n4.2. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/179866913/\" id=\"a_4\">State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh vs. Shashi Kumar</a>, (2019) 3 SCC 653 (“Shashi\n\nKumar”) to contend that where there is a significant gap between\n\nmaking the application for compassionate appointment and filing a Writ\n\nPetition to challenge inaction on the part of the Government, a direction\n\nto consider the application for compassionate appointment may not be\n\nissued.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">\n4.3. It was next contended that Circular No. 142-Emp. clarified that\n\n97-Emp. was applicable only in respect of State Government employees\n\nand directed the municipalities to formulate their own schemes for\n\ncompassionate appointment. This would mean that as a matter of policy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                   12</span>\n\n\nof the State Government, it was declared that it is not viable to give\n\ncompassionate appointment to heirs of employees of establishments of\n\npublic undertakings, statutory bodies, government companies and local\n\nauthorities. That by virtue of the clarification under Circular No. 142-\n\nEmp., the position would be that no scheme exists for compassionate\n\nappointment in Municipalities. It is for such establishments to\n\nformulate policies of their own in consultation with the respective\n\nadministrative department. That, in the absence of a sanctioned scheme\n\nfor compassionate appointment in respect of municipal employees, no\n\nrelief could have been granted by the High Court.\n\n\n4.4. It was urged that compassionate appointment could not be\n\nclaimed as a matter of right and a claim for the same must be\n\nentertained having regard to the compelling financial circumstances (if\n\nany) of the deceased’s dependent(s).

However, by way of\n\nNotification bearing No. 142-Emp. dated 1st November, 2007 it was\n\nclarified that Notification No. 97-Emp. was only restricted to State\n\nGovernment employees, and in so far as other establishments are\n\nconcerned, they would have to formulate their own policies having\n\nregard to the principles applicable to the State Government Employees.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">      That in the absence of a policy formulated specially for municipal\n\nemployees, compassionate appointment could have been granted on the\n\nstrength of Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp.\n\n\n5.3. It was averred that since delay in acting upon the application of\n\nthe Respondent-Writ Petitioners was attributable only to the appellant’s\n\nauthorities, therefore, the Respondents ought not to be prejudiced on\n\naccount of such delay.

These appeals primarily concern the question whether there exists\n\nany scheme in the State of West Bengal, governing compassionate\n\nappointment governing municipal employees dying in harness. In the\n\nevent that the aforesaid question is answered in the affirmative, it would\n\nbe necessary to determine whether a direction issued several years after\n\napplications for compassionate appointment are filled, to consider and\n\ndecide such applications, is in consonance with the object of a\n\npolicy/scheme for compassionate appointment.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">Policy of Compassionate Appointment: The Rationale:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">7.    The majesty of death is that it is a great leveller for, it makes no\n\ndistinction between the young and the old or the rich and the poor.\n\nDeath being as a consequence of birth at some point of time is inevitable\n\nfor every being. Thus, while death is certain, its timing is uncertain.\n\nFurther, a deceased employee does not always leave behind valuable\n\nassets; he may at times leave behind poverty to be faced by the\n\nimmediate members of his family. Therefore, what should be done to\n\nensure that death of an individual does not mean economic death for\n\nhis family?

In Shashi Kumar, this Court speaking through Dr. D.Y.\n\n       Chandrachud, J. (as His Lordship then was) observed that\n\n       compassionate appointment is an exception to the general rule\n\n       that appointment to any public post in the service of the State has\n\n       to be made on the basis of principles which accord with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles\n\n       14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_16\">16</a> of the Constitution. That the basis of the policy is that\n\n       it recognizes that a family of a deceased employee may be placed\n\n       in a position of financial hardship upon the untimely death of the\n\n       employee while in service. That it is the immediacy of the need\n\n       which furnishes the basis for the State to allow the benefit of\n\n       compassionate appointment. The pertinent observations of this\n\n       Court have been extracted as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">             “41. Insofar as the individual facts pertaining to the\n             Respondent are concerned, it has emerged from the\n             record that the Writ Petition before the High Court was\n             instituted on 11 May 2015. The application for\n             compassionate appointment was submitted on 8 May\n             2007. On 15 January 2008 the Additional Secretary\n             had required that the amount realized by way of\n             pension be included in the income statement of the\n             family. The Respondent waited thereafter for a period\n             in excess of seven years to move a petition Under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article\n             226</a> of the Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1737552\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/1737552/\" id=\"a_18\">Umesh Kumar Nagpal</a>\n             (supra), this Court has emphasized that the basis of a\n             scheme of compassionate appointment lies in the need\n             of providing immediate assistance to the family of the\n             deceased employee. This sense of immediacy is\n             evidently lost by the delay on the part of the dependant\n             in seeking compassionate appointment.”\n\n\n7.2. On consideration of the aforesaid decisions of this Court, the\n\nfollowing principles emerge:</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                      21</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\"> i.    That a provision for compassionate appointment makes a\n\n       departure from the general provisions providing for appointment\n\n       to a post by following a particular procedure of recruitment. Since\n\n       such a provision enables appointment being made without\n\n       following the said procedure, it is in the nature of an exception to\n\n       the general provisions and must be resorted to only in order to\n\n       achieve the stated objectives, i.e., to enable the family of the\n\n       deceased to get over the sudden financial crisis.\n\nii.    Appointment on compassionate grounds is not a source of\n\n       recruitment. The reason for making such a benevolent scheme by\n\n       the State or the public sector undertaking is to see that the\n\n       dependants of the deceased are not deprived of the means of\n\n       livelihood. It only enables the family of the deceased to get over\n\n       the sudden financial crisis.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">iii.   Compassionate appointment is not a vested right which can be\n\n       exercised at any time in future. Compassionate employment\n\n       cannot be claimed or offered after a lapse of time and after the\n\n       crisis is over.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">iv.    That compassionate appointment should be provided immediately\n\n       to redeem the family in distress. It is improper to keep such a case\n\n       pending for years.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\"> v.    In determining as to whether the family is in financial crisis, all\n\n       relevant aspects must be borne in mind including the income of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                    22</span>\n\n\n     the family, its liabilities, the terminal benefits if any, received by\n\n     the family, the age, dependency and marital status of its members,\n\n     together with the income from any other source.\n\n\n7.3. The object underlying a provision for grant of compassionate\n\nemployment is to enable the family of the deceased employee to tide over\n\nthe sudden crisis due to the death of the bread-earner which has left\n\nthe family in penury and without any means of livelihood. Out of pure\n\nhumanitarian consideration and having regard to the fact that unless\n\nsome source of livelihood is provided, the family would not be in a\n\nposition to make both ends meet, a provision is made for giving gainful\n\nappointment to one of the dependants of the deceased who may be\n\neligible for such appointment. Having regard to such an object, it would\n\nbe of no avail to grant compassionate appointment to the dependants of\n\nthe deceased employee, after the crisis which arose on account of death\n\nof a bread-winner, has been overcome. Thus, there is also a compelling\n\nneed to act with a sense of immediacy in matters concerning\n\ncompassionate appointment because on failure to do so, the object of\n\nthe scheme of compassionate would be frustrated. Where a long lapse\n\nof time has occurred since the date of death of the deceased employee,\n\nthe sense of immediacy for seeking compassionate appointment would\n\ncease to exist and thus lose its significance and this would be a relevant\n\ncircumstance which must weigh with the authorities in determining as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                    23</span>\n\n\nto whether a case for the grant of compassionate appointment has been\n\nmade out for consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\n7.4. As noted above, the sine qua non for entertaining a claim for\n\ncompassionate appointment is that the family of the deceased employee\n\nwould be unable to make two ends meet without one of the dependants\n\nof the deceased employee being employed on compassionate grounds.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">The financial condition of the family of the deceased, at the time of the\n\ndeath of the deceased, is the primary consideration that ought to guide\n\nthe authorities’ decision in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">\n7.5. Considering the second question <a href=\"/doc/1737552/\" id=\"a_19\">referred to above</a>, in the first\n\ninstance,   regarding    whether    applications   for   compassionate\n\nappointment could be considered after a delay of several years, we are\n\nof the view that, in a case where, for reasons of prolonged delay, either\n\non the part of the applicant in claiming compassionate appointment or\n\nthe authorities in deciding such claim, the sense of immediacy is diluted\n\nand lost. Further, the financial circumstances of the family of the\n\ndeceased, may have changed, for the better, since the time of the death\n\nof the government employee. In such circumstances, Courts or other\n\nrelevant authorities are to be guided by the fact that for such prolonged\n\nperiod of delay, the family of the deceased was able to sustain\n\nthemselves, most probably by availing gainful employment from some\n\nother source. Granting compassionate appointment in such a case, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                   24</span>\n\n\nnoted by this Court in Hakim Singh would amount to treating a claim\n\nfor compassionate appointment as though it were a matter of\n\ninheritance based on a line of succession which is contrary to the\n\nConstitution. Since compassionate appointment is not a vested right\n\nand the same is relative to the financial condition and hardship faced\n\nby the dependents of the deceased government employee as a\n\nconsequence of his death, a claim for compassionate appointment may\n\nnot be entertained after lapse of a considerable period of time since the\n\ndeath of the government employee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">8.   Laches or undue delay, the blame-worthy conduct of a person in\n\napproaching a Court of Equity in England for obtaining discretionary\n\nrelief which disentitled him for grant of such relief was explained\n\nsuccinctly by Sir Barnes Peacock, in Lindsay Petroleum Co. vs.\n\nProsper Armstrong, (1874) 3 PC 221 as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96294865\" id=\"span_39\">“Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not\n         an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be\n         practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the\n         party has, by his conduct, done that which might\n         fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or\n         where by his conduct and neglect he has, though\n         perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other\n         party in a situation, in which it would not be\n         reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards\n         to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time\n         and delay are most material. But in every case, if an\n         argument against relief, which otherwise would be\n         just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course\n         not amounting to a bar by any statute or limitations,\n         the validity of that defence must be tried upon\n         principles      substantially       equitable.     Two\n         circumstances, always important in such cases, are,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                    25</span>\n\n\n         the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done\n         during the interval, which might affect either party\n         and cause a balance of Justice or injustice in taking\n         the one course or the other, so far as it relates to the\n         remedy.”\n\n     Whether the above doctrine of laches which disentitled grant of\n\nrelief to a party by Equity Court of England, could disentitle the grant\n\nof relief to a person by the High Court in the exercise of its power under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of our Constitution, came up for consideration before a\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/96294865/\" id=\"a_21\">Moon Mills Ltd. vs. M.

It was stated that this Rule is\n         premised on a number of factors.

In fact, such a prolonged delay in\n\napproaching the High Court, may even be regarded as a waiver of a\n\nremedy, as discernible by the conduct of the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners. Such a delay would disentitle the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners to the discretionary relief under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution. Further, the order of the High Court dated 17 th March,\n\n2015, whereby the writ petition filed by some of the Respondents herein\n\nwas disposed of with a direction to the Director of Local Bodies,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal to take a decision as to the appointment of\n\nthe Respondents-Writ Petitioners, cannot be considered to have the\n\neffect of revival of the cause of action.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170758798\" id=\"span_47\">11.   It may be apposite at this juncture to refer to the following\n\nobservations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/170758798/\" id=\"a_29\">Malaya Nanda Sethy vs. State of Orissa</a>,\n\nAIR 2022 SC 2836, as to the manner in which the authorities must\n\nconsider and decide applications for appointment on compassionate\n\ngrounds:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">           “9. Before parting with the present order, we are\n           constrained to observe that considering the object and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                        28</span>\n\n\npurpose of appointment on compassionate grounds,\ni.e., a family of a deceased employee may be placed in\na position of financial hardship upon the untimely\ndeath of the employee while in service and the basis\nor policy is immediacy in rendering of financial\nassistance to the family of the deceased\nconsequent upon his untimely death, the\nauthorities must consider and decide such\napplications for appointment on compassionate\ngrounds as per the policy prevalent, at the earliest,\nbut not beyond a period of six months from the\ndate      of    submission    of   such     completed\napplications.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">         We are constrained to direct as above as we\nhave found that in several cases, applications for\nappointment on compassionate grounds are not\nattended in time and are kept pending for years\ntogether. As a result, the applicants in several cases\nhave to approach the concerned High Courts seeking\na writ of Mandamus for the consideration of their\napplications. Even after such a direction is issued,\nfrivolous or vexatious reasons are given for rejecting\nthe applications. Once again, the applicants have to\nchallenge the order of rejection before the High Court\nwhich leads to pendency of litigation and passage of\ntime, leaving the family of the employee who died in\nharness in the lurch and in financial difficulty.\nFurther, for reasons best known to the authorities and\non irrelevant considerations, applications made for\ncompassionate appointment are rejected. After several\nyears or are not considered at all as in the instant\ncase.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">         If the object and purpose of appointment on\ncompassionate grounds as envisaged under the\nrelevant policies or the rules have to be achieved\nthen it is just and necessary that such applications\nare considered well in time and not in a tardy way.\nWe have come across cases where for nearly two\ndecades the controversy regarding the application\nmade for compassionate appointment is not resolved.\nThis consequently leads to the frustration of the very\npolicy of granting compassionate appointment on the\ndeath of the employee while in service. We have,\ntherefore, directed that such applications must be\nconsidered at an earliest point of time. The\nconsideration must be fair, reasonable and based on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                    29</span>\n\n\n          relevant consideration. The application cannot be\n          rejected on the basis of frivolous and for reasons\n          extraneous to the facts of the case. Then and then only\n          the object and purpose of appointment on\n          compassionate grounds can be achieved.”\n\n                                               (emphasis by us)\n\n     In the said case, the claim of the appellant-applicant therein for\n\ncompassionate appointment was directed by this Court to be considered\n\nby the competent authority. This Court noted that in the said case, there\n\nwas no lapse on the part of the appellant-applicant therein in diligently\n\npursuing the matter. The delay in considering the application of the\n\nappellant therein was held to be solely attributable to the authorities of\n\nthe State, and no part of it was occasioned by the appellant-applicant.\n\nFurther, in the said case, the appellant-applicant was prejudiced not\n\nonly because of the prolonged delay in considering his application but\n\nalso by the fact that in the interim, the policy of the State governing\n\ncompassionate appointment had changed to his detriment. Therefore,\n\nthe facts of the said case were distinct from the facts involved herein. In\n\nthe present case, the conduct of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners\n\ncannot be said to be blameless in that they did not pursue their matter\n\nwith sufficient diligence. However, the observations made in the said\n\ncase as to the manner in which applications for compassionate\n\nappointment are to be considered and disposed of are relevant to the\n\npresent case.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                          30</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       As noted in the said case, the operation of a policy/scheme for\n\ncompassionate appointment is founded on considerations of immediacy.\n\nA sense of immediacy is called for not only in the manner in which the\n\napplications are processed by the concerned authorities but also in the\n\nconduct of the applicant in pursuing his case, before the authorities and\n\nif needed before the Courts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">12.    In     the   present   case,     the    applications    for   compassionate\n\nappointment were made by the Respondents-Writ Petitioners in the year\n\n2005-2006. Admittedly, the first concrete step taken by the Chairman\n\nof the Burdwan Municipality was in the year 2013, when the said\n\nauthority forwarded a list of candidates to be approved by the Director\n\nof    Local    Bodies,   Burdwan        Municipality.    The    Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners knocked on the doors of the High Court of Calcutta only in\n\nthe year 2015, i.e., after a lapse of nearly ten years from the date of\n\nmaking        the   application   for     compassionate        appointment.   The\n\nRespondents-Writ Petitioners were not prudent enough to approach the\n\nCourts sooner, claiming that no concrete step had been taken by the\n\nAppellant-State in furtherance of the application by seeking a Writ in\n\nthe nature of Mandamus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">13.    The sense of immediacy in the matter of compassionate\n\nappointment has been lost in the present case. This is attributable to\n\nthe authorities of the Appellant-State as well as the Respondents-Writ\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                   31</span>\n\n\nPetitioners. Now, entertaining a claim which was made in 2005-2006,\n\nin the year 2023, would be of no avail, because admittedly, the\n\nRespondents-Writ Petitioners have been able to eke out a living even\n\nthough they did not successfully get appointed to the services of the\n\nMunicipality on compassionate grounds. Hence, we think that this is\n\ntherefore not fit cases to direct that the claim of the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners for appointments on compassionate grounds, be considered\n\nor entertained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">14.   However, we must sound a strong word of reproach directed at the\n\nauthorities of the Appellant-State, about the manner in which the\n\napplications for compassionate appointment of hundreds of dependents\n\nhave been dealt with. Much uncertainty looms around the scope, extent\n\nand beneficiaries of the various schemes formulated by the State for\n\ngoverning compassionate appointment and therefore, the concerned\n\nauthorities are unable/unwilling to positively decide claims for\n\ncompassionate appointment. This may have ultimately resulted in\n\nprejudice to the families of many government employees dying in\n\nharness. Delay on the part of the authorities of the State to decide\n\nclaims for compassionate appointment would no doubt frustrate the\n\nvery object of a scheme of compassionate appointment. Government\n\nofficials are to act with a sense of utmost proactiveness and immediacy\n\nwhile deciding claims of compassionate appointment so as to ensure\n\nthat the wholesome object of such a scheme is fulfilled.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                   32</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">15.   The question as to whether a direction issued several years after\n\nan application for compassionate appointment, to consider and decide\n\nsuch application, is in consonance with the object of a policy/scheme\n\nfor compassionate appointment, has been answered in the negative.\n\nHowever, we shall also examine whether these appeals must succeed\n\non a second count, i.e., whether there exists any scheme in the State of\n\nWest Bengal, governing compassionate appointment vis-à-vis municipal\n\nemployees dying in harness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">16.   In order to determine the question as to whether there exists any\n\nscheme in the State of West Bengal, governing compassionate\n\nappointment vis-à-vis municipal employees dying in harness, it would\n\nbe useful to refer to the content of the relevant State Government\n\nNotifications issued in this regard.

It merely defines the scope of operation of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                    40</span>\n\n\nCircular No. 97-Emp. dated 6th June, 2005. Therefore Circular No. 97-\n\nEmp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp. concern the procedure governing\n\ncompassionate appointment, only qua State Government employees.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">      Further, applications for compassionate appointment are to be\n\nconsidered in light of the policy holding the field on the date on which\n\nthe application is filed. In the present case, the applications were filed\n\nin the year 2006. Therefore, they would have to be decided in light of\n\nCircular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp. Given that the\n\nsaid Circular does not govern compassionate appointment to posts\n\nunder local authorities, compassionate appointment cannot be granted\n\nto posts under local authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">\n16.3. It is the case of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners herein that\n\nthough Circular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp is not\n\napplicable to local authorities, their applications for compassionate\n\nappointment ought to have been considered in light of 301-Emp., 302-\n\nEmp. and 303-Emp. which, according to the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners is applicable to all departments and authorities covered\n\nunder the Act of 1999. However, in our view, the said Circulars were\n\nnot understood or read to be a scheme governing all employees of other\n\nestablishments governed by the Act of 1999. We say so for the following\n\nreasons:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">i)   Circular No. 303-Emp. provides that any Department which has\n\n     vacancy in the Exempted Category of posts will provide employment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                                     41</span>\n\n\n      to the wife/son/daughter/near relation of the employee who died\n\n      in harness. Use of the word ‘Department’ would indicate that the\n\n      said Circular would govern compassionate appointment to\n\n      Departments of the State Government and not to local authorities.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">ii)   The meaning of the word ‘Department’ would have to be gathered,\n\n      having regard to the fact that the immediate notification\n\n      subsequent to 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp., being 97-Emp.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">      dated 6th June, 2005 notifies the departments in whose vacancies\n\n      the appointments would be granted. The Departments are of the\n\n      State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125900606\" id=\"span_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1125536\" id=\"span_64\">iii) If Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp. are to be read\n\n      so as to cover all establishments of the Act of 1999, then 97-Emp.\n\n      dated 6th June, 2005, should provide for appointment in the\n\n      establishment covered by the Act of 1999 concerned. It does not do\n\n      so. Therefore, Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp.\n\n      cannot be held to be applicable to local authorities.\n\n\n16.4. The existence of a policy issued by the State Government is a sine\n\nqua non for making appointments on compassionate basis, vide\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1125536/\" id=\"a_36\">Mumtaz Yunus Mulani (Smt.) vs. State of Maharashtra</a> (supra);\n\n<a href=\"/doc/125900606/\" id=\"a_37\">State Bank of India vs. Surya Narain Tripathi</a>, 2014 (15) SCC 739.\n\nThe appointments must follow the stipulations made in the policy. It is\n\ntherefore a no-brainer that in the absence of a policy governing\n\ncompassionate appointment to posts under a local authority, no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                    42</span>\n\n\nappointment could be made to such an authority on compassionate\n\ngrounds.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">    Having held that Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp.\n\ncannot be held to be applicable to local authorities, we are unable to\n\naffirm the findings of the Division Bench of the High Court to the effect\n\nthat given that Circular No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were\n\nnot specifically withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable\n\nand therefore, compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities\n\nwould be governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-\n\nEmp. and 303-Emp.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">    We are further of the view that the liberty granted to the local\n\nauthorities in Circular No. 142-Emp. to formulate their own scheme for\n\ncompassionate appointment, is an acknowledgement of the fact that\n\nthere was no policy existing to govern compassionate appointment to\n\nposts under local authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n16.5. In fine, the present appeals succeed on two counts: first, there was\n\nno policy existing to govern compassionate appointment to posts under\n\nlocal authorities in the State of West Bengal and hence, in the absence\n\nof such a policy, compassionate appointment cannot be granted;\n\nsecond,    assuming that there was such a policy, it would be of no\n\nredeeming purpose to direct that the applications for appointment on\n\ncompassionate grounds be considered and decided several years after\n\nthey were filed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">\f                                    43</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">17.   In light of the aforesaid discussion, the instant appeals succeed\n\nin the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">i.
