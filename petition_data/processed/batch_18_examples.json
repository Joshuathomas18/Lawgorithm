    "input": "Insofar as the words used ‘total income’ in <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_47\">section\n  153A</a> of the Act, 1961, it is submitted that before\n  insertion of the new scheme of assessment under\n  Section   153A,       there   was   a   concept   of   block\n  assessment in respect of the search period. There was\n  one assessment for the block period in respect of the\n  undisclosed income found during the search.            This\n  undisclosed income was being taxed at a special rate of\n  60% and that is why, such income was being identified\n  separately as against the regular income for each of the\n  assessment year. The above concept was given a go-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">  by on introducing this new scheme of assessment\n  under section 153A which provided that assessment\n  will be made for each of the assessment year\n  separately and the income found undisclosed during\n  the search will be taxed at the normal rate. Hence, in\n  section 153A, it has been stated that ‘total income&#x27; will\n  be assessed. This means that while computing tax\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.                                            Page 34 of 59</span>\n\f  liability, income disclosed as well as undisclosed\n  income found during the course of search will be\n  clubbed to determine the ‘total income’ and tax to be\n  computed on the basis of such ‘total income’. Thus, on\n  the basis of the expression &#x27;total income&#x27; in section\n  153A, the contention of the Revenue that the AO gets\n  power to assess ‘total income’ which will include even\n  income without there being any incriminating material\n  found during the search in respect of assessments\n  which have not abated is not tenable. It is submitted\n  that the meaning of the expression ‘total income’ here\n  will be income originally assessed and the income\n  found during the course of the search. On the basis of\n  this expression &#x27;total income’, the AO cannot get\n  jurisdiction to make an assessment in respect of other\n  material available on record despite no incriminating\n  material being found during the course of the search. It\n  is submitted that therefore when the purpose of the\n  search is to collect information and in case no material\n  is found in the search for the particular assessment\n  year, there is no justification for tinkering with the\n  unabated assessment. It is submitted that therefore in\n  case no incriminating material is found during the\n  search, that jurisdiction comes to an end and AO\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.                                        Page 35 of 59</span>\n\f  cannot use that opportunity to bring to tax income on\n  the basis of the material available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">  xvi)      It is submitted that further as per sub-section\n  (2) of section 153A of the if any proceeding or any order\n  of assessment or reassessment made under sub-\n  section (1) is annulled in appeal or any other legal\n  provision, then the assessment or reassessment\n  relating to any assessment year which had abated\n  under the second proviso would stand revived. It is\n  submitted that only the proceedings that have been\n  abated shall be revived. The proceedings for other\n  assessment years are not revived even if there is any\n  income    that   has   escaped   assessment.     Meaning\n  thereby, that intention of the legislation is to only give\n  power to AO for making assessments, which he was\n  earlier having in respect of assessments, which were\n  pending as on date of search and not the other\n  assessments. It is submitted that had the intention of\n  legislature as is being contended On behalf of the\n  Revenue that AO has power to make additions in those\n  assessment years where there is no incriminating\n  material, the legislature would have provided that in\n  case of annulled assessments, in the case of unabated\n  assessments, the AO shall on the basis of the additions\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

It is submitted that restricting\n  annulled assessments to only abated assessments, is\n  putting the wheel back to a situation as if there was no\n  search.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">4.1   The submissions on behalf of the assessees in a\ntabulated form thus are as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">S.

In absence of any incriminating material, the completed\n    assessment can be reiterated and the abated assessment\n    or reassessment can be made.

Once a search or requisition\n  is made, a mandate is cast upon the Assessing Officer to\n  issue notice under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_71\">section 153A</a> of the Act to the person\n  requiring him to furnish the return of income in respect of\n  each assessment year falling within six assessment years\n  immediately preceding the’ assessment year relevant to the\n  previous year in which such search is conducted or\n  requisition is made and assess or reassess the same. Since\n  the assessment under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_72\">section 153A</a> of the Act is\n  linked with search and requisition under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_73\">sections 132</a> and\n  <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_74\">132A</a> of the Act, it is evident that the object of the section is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

The second proviso makes the intention\n  of the Legislature clear as the same provides that\n  assessment or reassessment, if any, relating to the six\n  assessment years referred to in the sub-section pending on\n  the date of initiation of search under section 132 or\n  requisition under section 132A, as the case may be, shall\n  abate. Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_76\">section 153A</a> of the Act provides\n  that if any proceeding or any order of assessment or\n  reassessment made under sub-section (1) is annulled in\n  appeal or any other legal provision, then the assessment or\n  reassessment relating to any assessment year which had\n  abated under the second proviso would stand revived. The\n  proviso thereto says, that such revival shall cease to have\n  effect if such order of annulment is set aside. Thus, any\n  proceeding of assessment or reassessment falling within the,\n  six assessment years prior to the search or requisition stands\n  abated and the total income of the assessee is required to be\n  determined under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_77\">section 153A</a>, of the Act. Similarly, sub-\n  section (2) provides for revival of any assessment or\n  reassessment which stood abated, if any proceeding or any\n  order of assessment or reassessment made under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_78\">section\n  153A</a> of, the Act is annulled in appeal or any other\n  proceeding.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">  16.

When, the very purpose of the provision is to\n  make assessment in case of search or requisition, it goes\n  without saying that the assessment has to have relation to\n  the search or requisition. In other words, the assessment,\n  should be connected with something found during the search\n  or requisition, viz., incriminating material which reveals\n  undisclosed income Thus, while in view of the mandate of\n  sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_79\">section 153A</a> of the Act, in every case\n  where there is a search or requisition, the Assessing Officer\n  is obliged to issue notice to such person to furnish returns of\n  income for the six years preceding the assessment year\n  relevant to the previous year in which the search is\n  conducted or requisition is made, any addition or\n  disallowance can be made only on the basis of material\n  collected during the search or requisition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73963141\" id=\"span_62\">In case no\n  incriminating material is found, as held by the Rajasthan High\n  Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/73963141/\" id=\"a_80\">Jai Steel (India) v.

Secondly, that the\n‘undisclosed income’ was chargeable to tax at a special\nrate of 60% under section 113 whereas income other than\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.                                           Page 48 of 59</span>\n\f‘undisclosed income’ was required to be assessed under\nregular assessment procedure and was taxable at normal\nrate. Therefore, section 153A came to be inserted and\nbrought on the statute. Under Section 153A regime, the\nintention of the legislation was to do away with the\nscheme of two parallel assessments and tax the\n‘undisclosed’ income too at the normal rate of tax as\nagainst any special rate.         Thus, after introduction of\nSection 153A and in case of search, there shall be block\nassessment for six years.         Search assessments/block\nassessments under Section 153A are triggered by\nconducting of a valid search under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 132</a> of the Act,\n1961.     The   very    purpose    of   search,   which   is   a\nprerequisite/trigger for invoking the provisions of sections\n153A/153C is detection of undisclosed income by\nundertaking extraordinary power of search and seizure,\ni.e., the income which cannot be detected in ordinary\ncourse of regular assessment. Thus, the foundation for\nmaking search assessments under Sections 153A/153C\ncan be said to be the existence of incriminating material\nshowing undisclosed income detected as a result of\nsearch.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">10.

As per the provisions of Section 153A, in case of a\nsearch under Section 132 or requisition under Section\n132A, the AO gets the jurisdiction to assess or reassess\nthe ‘total income’ in respect of each assessment year\nfalling within six assessment years.               However, it is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

As\nper sub-section (2) of Section 153A, if any proceeding\ninitiated or any order of assessment or reassessment\nmade under sub-section (1) has been annulled in appeal\nor any other legal proceeding, then, notwithstanding\nanything contained in sub-section (1) or section 153, the\nassessment or reassessment relating to any assessment\nyear which has abated under the second proviso to sub-\nsection (1), shall stand revived with effect from the date of\nreceipt   of   the   order   of   such   annulment   by   the\nCommissioner. Therefore, the intention of the legislation\nseems to be that in case of search only the pending\nassessment/reassessment proceedings shall abate and\nthe AO would assume the jurisdiction to assess or\nreassess the ‘total income’ for the entire six years\nperiod/block assessment period. The intention does not\nseem to be           to re-open the completed/unabated\nassessments, unless any incriminating material is found\nwith respect to concerned assessment year falling within\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

Therefore, on true\ninterpretation of <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 153A</a> of the Act, 1961, in case of\na search under Section 132 or requisition under Section\n132A and during the search any incriminating material is\nfound, even in case of unabated/completed assessment,\nthe AO would have the jurisdiction to assess or reassess\nthe   ‘total   income’     taking    into    consideration      the\nincriminating material collected during the search and\nother material which would include income declared in the\nreturns, if any, furnished by the assessee as well as the\nundisclosed income. However, in case during the search\nno    incriminating     material    is   found,   in     case    of\ncompleted/unabated        assessment,       the   only    remedy\navailable to the Revenue would be to initiate the\nreassessment proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_94\">sections 147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/317036/\" id=\"a_95\">48</a> of the\nAct, subject to fulfilment of the conditions mentioned in\nsections 147/148, as in such a situation, the Revenue\ncannot be left with no remedy. Therefore, even in case of\nblock assessment under section 153A and in case of\nunabated/completed        assessment        and   in     case   no\nincriminating material is found during the search, the\npower of the Revenue to have the reassessment under\n<a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_96\">sections 147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_97\">148</a> of the Act has to be saved, otherwise\nthe Revenue would be left without remedy.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.
