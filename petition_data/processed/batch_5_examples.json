    "input": "Main submissions have been made on behalf of the appellants\n\nin Civil Appeal No. 2502 of 2022 by Shri Shekhar Naphade, learned\n\nsenior counsel.   He has taken us through the 2000 Act and ST\n\nRules. Relying upon the decision in the case of Kumari Madhuri\n\nPatil1, he urged that the documents which pertain to the pre­\n\nConstitution period have the greatest probative value. He submits\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                  12</span>\n\fthat if such documents in support of caste claim are presented\n\nbefore the Scrutiny Committee, and if the same are found to be\n\nrelevant and genuine, there is no occasion for the Scrutiny\n\nCommittee to order an enquiry through Vigilance Cell. Similarly, if\n\nblood relatives of the person applying for verification before the\n\nCaste Scrutiny    Committee have been granted caste validity\n\ncertificates, no further enquiry by the Scrutiny Committee is called\n\nfor. In both cases, it is the duty of the Caste Scrutiny Committee to\n\nvalidate the caste certificate. He invited our attention to Rule 12 of\n\nthe ST Rules which lays down the procedure to be followed by the\n\nScrutiny Committee. He pointed out that sub­rule (2) provides that\n\nonly if Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied with the documentary\n\nevidence produced by the applicant, it can order enquiry through\n\nVigilance Cell. He pointed out that the question of the conduct of\n\nthe affinity test arises only after the case is forwarded to the\n\nVigilance Cell after the Scrutiny Committee comes to the conclusion\n\nthat the documents produced by the applicant are not sufficient to\n\nprove the caste claim.",

He\n\nsubmitted that if an applicant successfully establishes his caste\n\nclaim on the basis of documents relating to the pre­Constitution\n\nperiod or documents having probative value or a caste validity\n\ncertificate granted to his blood relative, it is not necessary to apply\n\nthe affinity test.",

She submitted that the State Government cannot\n\nmake an effort to indirectly modify the Third Schedule under the ST\n\nOrder as the modification can be carried out only in accordance\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 341</a> of the Constitution. Her submission is that in a\n\ngiven case if the documents having probative value show that the\n\napplicant belongs to the Thakur caste or belongs to any other caste\n\nnotified in the Third Schedule to the 1976 Act, there is no question\n\nof holding any affinity test.",

A submission is made that the\n\nScrutiny Committee can also go into the question whether the\n\nearlier validity certificate has been issued based on an erroneous\n\norder of the High Court.
