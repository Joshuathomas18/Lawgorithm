Some of the Petitioners submit that they propose to argue\nthat an unconditional stay, and subject only to the Petitioners&#x27;\nundertaking, should continue or be made in respect of delivery\norders. Ex facie that appears to us to be a difficult proposition to\naccept. Stamp duty is a taxing or a fiscal measure under a dedicated\nstatute. The payment is into revenue. Merely saying, as some\nPetitioners do, that they do not trust the Government is a less than\npersuasive argument. The remedies to that lie elsewhere and not in\na Writ Court.",
