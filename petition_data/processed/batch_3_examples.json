    "input": "As far as the violation of <a href=\"/doc/607947/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 25(G)</a> of the Act is\n\nconcerned, learned Labour Court has spelled out the reasoning in\n\n\n\n\n\nPara-12 of the award by giving reference of the workmen who were\n\njunior to the present respondent i.e. engaged after the present\n\nrespondent    and   whose    services   in   fact    stood       subsequently\n\nregularized. During the hearing of this writ petition, it could not be\n\ndemonstrated on the basis of record by the petitioners/State that the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 13/04/2023 20:32:38 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                   10</span>\n\nfindings so returned by the learned Labour Court were perverse\n\nfindings and not borne out from the record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">13.         As far as the issue of delay and laches is concerned it is\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">borne out from the record that after the termination of his services in\n\nthe month of November, 1999, it is not as if the petitioner raised the\n\n\n\n\n\nindustrial dispute for the first time in the year 2010. Record\n\ndemonstrates that the petitioner raised the industrial dispute in the\n\n\n\n\n\nyear 2006 also but the same was rejected by the authority concerned\n\nas at the relevant time, the department concerned did not place before\n\nthe authority the correct facts, in terms whereof, the petitioner had put\n\nin more than 240 days in the calendar year preceding his termination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"7876509\" id=\"span_21\">When this fact came to the notice of the workman that he again\n\n\n\nagitated the issue and as the stand of the workman was found correct,\n\n\n\n\nit is thereafter that the Appropriate Government made the reference to\n\n\n\n\n\nthe learned Labour Court. A perusal of the Award passed by learned\n\nLabour Court demonstrates that this issue has been addressed and\n\n\n\n\n\nredressed by the learned Labour Court while deciding Issue No. 3,\n\nfindings returned wherein are substantiated from the record. As far as\n\nthe judgment relied upon by learned Deputy Advocate General, in <a href=\"/doc/7876509/\" id=\"a_14\">the\n\nsaid   judgment</a>,   i.e.   <a href=\"/doc/7876509/\" id=\"a_15\">Prabhakar    vs.   Joint    Director        Sericulture\n\nDepartment and another</a> (supra), Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India has\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 13/04/2023 20:32:38 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  11</span>\n\nlaid down the law that notwithstanding the fact that law of limitation\n\ndoes not apply to the industrial disputes, it is to be shown by the\n\nworkman that there is a dispute in praesenti. Hon&#x27;ble Court has held\n\n\n\n\n                                                             .</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7876509\" id=\"span_24\">that the workman has to demonstrate that even if considerable period\n\nhas lapsed and there are delays and laches, such delay has not\n\n\n\n\n\nresulted into making the industrial dispute cease to exist and if the\n\nworkman is able to give satisfactory explanation for these laches and\n\n\n\n\n\ndelays and demonstrate that the circumstances disclose that issue is\n\nstill alive, delay would not come in his way because of the reason that\n\nlaw of limitation has no applicability. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme <a href=\"/doc/7876509/\" id=\"a_16\">Court further\n\nheld</a> that if on the other hand because of such delay dispute no longer\n\nremains alive and is to be treated as &quot;dead&quot;, then it would be non-</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">existent dispute which cannot be referred to. In this case, as already\n\n\n\n\nmentioned hereinabove, the petitioner had initially agitated his cause\n\n\n\n\n\nin the year 2006 which was wrongly rejected by the authority\n\nconcerned and thereafter he subsequently took up the issue in the\n\n\n\n\n\nyear 2010. As the contention and grievance of the petitioner that\n\npersons junior to him were not only retained by the department but\n\ntheir services were subsequently regularized is a matter of record and\n\nfurther as the services of the workman were terminated by the\n\ndepartment in the year 1999 in violation of the provisions of Sections\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 13/04/2023 20:32:38 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                       12</span>\n\n25(F) and 25(G) of the Industrial Disputes Act, therefore, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the industrial dispute had ceased to exist.",
