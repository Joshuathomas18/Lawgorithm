The\n‘Pushtaini’ landholders whose lands were acquired, were given additional\ncompensation @ Rs.3 per sq. yard along with 15% as rehabilitation bonus on\nthe compensation already awarded, as also the 10% area of the acquired land,\nwhereas those who were declared as ‘Gair-pusht xcaini’ were denied this\nadditional benefit.

    "input": "Before we enter into the factual matrix of the case, we find it expedient to\nfirst trace out the etymology of the words “Pushtaini” and “Gair Pushtaini” used\nin the impugned classification, for language, once adopted inside the realm of\nlaw, materializes itself a much more powerful being, one which must be\nunderstood in the right historical context.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">7.      The word ‘Pushtaini’ is a Persian word and finds its origin from the word\n‘Pusht’, which means ‘back’. The said word has been historically used in the\ncontext of ancestry. Any possession, tale or legend, that has roots to a particular\nancestry, to denote it’s significance to the said ancestry, the word ‘Pushtaini’ is\nused.    As is obvious, since the word ‘Gair’ which finds its origin in Urdu\nlanguage means ‘other than’, thus, ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ would mean one which is\nnot ‘Pushtaini’.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">8.      What we find most interesting however, is that ancestry as a concept,\nespecially before times of modern private property ownership, had remained to\nbe a tool for inclusivity and not exclusion. In such a context, the use of the word\n“Pushtaini” by the Authority, to exclude compensation might be a historically\ninaccurate interpretation. While this is not consequential to the merits of the\ncase, it is in our opinion a worthwhile observation, for law has to power to\nlegitimize the meaning of words and can change the context in which a word\nused, and in turn can change the course of history itself.",

A huge amount of\nmoney was infused in the Indian Economy with the purpose of developing\nIndian cities into massive global hubs of capital and business. In line with this,\nDelhi began its journey of becoming a global city.

To contain such influx of migrants\nand ensure dignified living for all who came to the city with the hopes of\nimproving their lives, the government of India planned to develop residential\nand industrial areas around the capital.
