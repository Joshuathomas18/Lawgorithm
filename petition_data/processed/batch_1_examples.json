Thereafter, the consortium of lenders in a\n\n          meeting of the JLF decided to conduct a forensic audit of the appellant for\n\n          the period till 31 March 2019. The appellant participated in the audit\n\n          process and submitted all the information required by the auditor from time\n\n          to time. In September 2019, the appellant learnt that its account has been\n\n          declared as fraud by the Union Bank of India (erstwhile Andhra Bank).\n\n          Aggrieved by that classification, the appellant filed a writ petition before the\n\n          High Court of Telangana.
