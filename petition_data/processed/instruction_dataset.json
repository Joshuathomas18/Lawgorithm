Thereafter, the consortium of lenders in a\n\n          meeting of the JLF decided to conduct a forensic audit of the appellant for\n\n          the period till 31 March 2019. The appellant participated in the audit\n\n          process and submitted all the information required by the auditor from time\n\n          to time. In September 2019, the appellant learnt that its account has been\n\n          declared as fraud by the Union Bank of India (erstwhile Andhra Bank).\n\n          Aggrieved by that classification, the appellant filed a writ petition before the\n\n          High Court of Telangana.

    "input": "The facts in a nutshell are that the Act of 1955 was enacted by the\n\nHimachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly with a view to levy tax on\n\npassengers and goods carried by road in certain motor vehicles in the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh. The said Act received Presidential assent on\n\n25 November, 1955.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">3.2. The appellant, NHPC Ltd. is engaged in the generation of\n\nelectricity and has various projects in the State of Himachal Pradesh.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">Many project sites are situated at different locations in the interiors of\n\nHimachal Pradesh. These work sites are not properly serviced by any\n\npublic transport system or regular taxis. The residential colonies of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                     4</span>\n\n\nstaff employed at the various project sites are located at far of distances\n\nfrom the project sites. Therefore, as a welfare measure, the appellant,\n\nNHPC Ltd. provides transport facilities to its employees in order to\n\nenable them to reach their respective work sites from their residential\n\ncolonies and for their children to travel to and from their schools,\n\ncomfortably. It is to be clarified at this juncture that the transport\n\nfacilities were being provided free of cost, for the exclusive use of the\n\nemployees of the appellant and their children and members of the public\n\nwere not permitted to use the said transport facilities. The buses utilized\n\nfor such purpose were owned and operated by the appellant-NHPC Ltd.\n\n\n3.3. The Assessing Authority under the Act of 1955, Respondent No. 3\n\nherein, assessed the liability of the appellant-NHPC Ltd. to pay\n\npassenger tax under the Act for the years 1984-1985 to 1986-1987 and\n\n1987-1988 to 1990-1991 in respect of the activity of providing transport\n\nfacilities to its employees and their children. Assessment Orders were\n\npassed on 01 October, 1992 stipulating the liability of the appellant,\n\nNHPC Ltd. to pay passenger tax under the Act of 1955, on the premise\n\nthat its employees and their children were passengers under the Act\n\nand therefore, the appellant was liable to pay passenger tax for\n\nproviding them with transport facilities as described hereinabove. It is\n\nto be stated at this juncture that the Assessment Orders were passed\n\non the assumption that every bus of the appellant, NHPC Ltd. was\n\nplying on every day of the relevant years; a passenger travelled on every\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                            5</span>\n\n\n      seat of every bus; and every employee travelled the full distance shown\n\n      in the logbook.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\n      3.4.    The appellant filed Revision Application before the Commissioner,\n\n      Excise and Taxation, Himachal Pradesh, Respondent No. 2 herein,\n\n      challenging the Assessment Orders dated 01 October, 1992. The same\n\n      was dismissed on the ground that a revision application would not be\n\n      maintainable and it would be appropriate to instead, file an appeal.\n\n\n      3.5. In the said background, the appellant, NHPC Ltd. filed Writ\n\n      Petition No.1733 of 1995 before the High Court, challenging the vires of\n\n      the Act of 1955, and the assessments made in accordance with the\n\n      provisions thereof. The pertinent contentions raised by the appellant in\n\n      the said Writ Petition may be encapsulated as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"> i.          That under the Act of 1955, no tax can be levied on the appellant\n\n             as its employees and their children were being carried in the\n\n             appellant’s buses, without any fare or consideration. That\n\n             passenger tax as contemplated under the Act of 1955 was to be\n\n             levied only on fare-paying passengers against tickets issued by the\n\n             owner of the motor vehicles, who is engaged in the business of\n\n             carrying passengers for hire and reward.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">ii.          That no rate or fare had been specified by the competent authority\n\n             under the <a href=\"/doc/24626380/\" id=\"a_5\">Motor Vehicles Act, 1939</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_6\">MV\n\n             Act</a>” for short) for the routes on which the appellant’s buses plied,\n\n             nor had any contractual rate been agreed upon between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                           6</span>\n\n\n           appellants and its employees. Therefore, the charging provision,\n\n           i.e., <a href=\"/doc/189565512/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 3 (1)</a> of the Act of 1955 and the Explanation thereto\n\n           would not be attracted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">iii.       That in passing the Assessment Orders dated 01 October, 1992,\n\n           erroneous and baseless assumptions had been made to the effect\n\n           that every bus of the appellant, NHPC Ltd. was plying on every day\n\n           of the relevant year; a passenger travelled on every seat of every\n\n           bus; every employee travelled the full distance shown in the\n\n           logbook; and every passenger was paying a fare of Rs. 1.15 per\n\n           kilometer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">iv.        That even if the assessee was liable to pay tax under the Act of\n\n           1955, they would not be liable to pay surcharge under <a href=\"/doc/42391191/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3A</a>\n\n           of the Act as the said provision would not be applicable to the\n\n           appellants. Further, <a href=\"/doc/42391191/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 3A</a> of the Act of            1955 was\n\n           unconstitutional and suffered from excessive delegation of powers\n\n           to the State Government to prescribe the rate of surcharge leviable,\n\n           without laying down any guideline on the basis of which surcharge\n\n           was to be prescribed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n       3.6. By the Judgment and Order dated 27 March, 1997, the Division\n\n       Bench of the High Court allowed Civil Writ Petition No.1733 of 1995\n\n       filed by the appellant and directed the Respondents to refund the tax\n\n       collected under the provisions of the Act of 1955. The pertinent findings\n\n       of the Division Bench of the High Court are culled out hereinunder:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                       7</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"> i.    That the scheme of the Act of 1955 was to levy a tax on passengers\n\n       of certain motor vehicles only. Intention of the legislature could be\n\n       gathered from the various definitions contained in <a href=\"/doc/143111250/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 2</a> of the\n\n       Act, and the same was to make the Act applicable only to persons\n\n       who carried on the business of transport. The definition of ‘owner’\n\n       would fortify such finding, as ‘owner’ was defined to mean a person\n\n       holding a permit under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_11\">Motor Vehicles Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">ii.    That the liability of the assessee was to be determined for the years\n\n       1984-1985 to 1986-1987 and 1987-1988 to 1990-1991.",

Similarly, if\n\nblood relatives of the person applying for verification before the\n\nCaste Scrutiny    Committee have been granted caste validity\n\ncertificates, no further enquiry by the Scrutiny Committee is called\n\nfor. In both cases, it is the duty of the Caste Scrutiny Committee to\n\nvalidate the caste certificate. He invited our attention to Rule 12 of\n\nthe ST Rules which lays down the procedure to be followed by the\n\nScrutiny Committee. He pointed out that sub­rule (2) provides that\n\nonly if Scrutiny Committee is not satisfied with the documentary\n\nevidence produced by the applicant, it can order enquiry through\n\nVigilance Cell. He pointed out that the question of the conduct of\n\nthe affinity test arises only after the case is forwarded to the\n\nVigilance Cell after the Scrutiny Committee comes to the conclusion\n\nthat the documents produced by the applicant are not sufficient to\n\nprove the caste claim.",

This doctrine of\n             equality before the law is a necessary corollary to the high\n             concept of the rule of law accepted by our Constitution. One\n             of the aspects of rule of law is that every executive action, if\n             it is to operate to the prejudice of any person, must be\n             supported by some legislative authority: see State of Madhya\n             Pradesh v.Thakur Bharat Singh [ Civil Appeal No. 1066 of\n             1965 (decided on 23-1-1967)] . Secondly, such a law would\n\n\n                                5 of 36\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">             ::: Downloaded on - 19-07-2023 02:03:42 :::</span>\n                                                   Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:088633\n\n\n\n\nCWP-27167 of 2018                   -6- 2023:PHHC:088633\nand all connected cases\n            be void, if it discriminates or enables an authority to\n            discriminate between persons without just classification.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">            What a legislature could not do, the executive could not\n            obviously do. But in the present case the executive claims a\n            right to issue a passport at its discretion; that is to say, it\n            can at its discretion prevent a person from leaving India on\n            foreign travel. Whether the right to travel is part of personal\n            liberty or not within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the\n            Constitution, such an arbitrary prevention of a person from\n            travelling abroad will certainly affect him prejudicially. A\n            person may like to go abroad for many reasons. He may like\n            to see the world, to study abroad, to undergo medical\n            treatment that is not available in our country, to collaborate\n            in scientific research, to develop his mental horizon in\n            different fields and such others. An executive arbitrariness\n            can prevent one from doing so and permit another to travel\n            merely for pleasure. While in the case of enacted law one\n            knows where he stands, in the case of unchannelled arbitrary\n            discretion, discrimination is writ large on the face of it. Such\n            a discretion patently violates the doctrine of equality, for the\n            difference in the treatment of persons rests solely on the\n            arbitrary selection of the executive. The argument that the\n            said discretionary power of the State is a political or a\n            diplomatic one does not make it anytheless an executive\n            power. We, therefore, hold that the order refusing to issue\n            the passport to the petitioner offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 14</a> of the\n            Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">9.

An argument was raised on behalf of the petitioner that the words &#x27;as such&#x27; in rule 14 of Rules of 1998 refers to five years continuous regular service and not regular continuous service with the qualification prescribed for the post on which promotion was sought. Learned Single Judge examined the statutory scheme and held as under in para 8 to 10 of the judgement:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       &quot;8. Before the commencement of U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules, 1983, Regulations 5 and 6 of <a href=\"/doc/169562622/\" id=\"a_15\">Chapter II of U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921</a> regulated the promotions. <a href=\"/doc/92503551/\" id=\"a_16\">Regulation 6</a> provides that all the L.T. or C.T. grade teachers, as the case may be, having a minimum of 5 years&#x27; continuous substantive service to their credit on the case of occurrence of vacancy shall be considered for promotion by the Committee of Management without their having to apply for the same provided they possess the prescribed minimum qualifications for teaching the subject in which the teacher in the lecturer&#x27;s grade or in the L.T. grade is required. Rule 9 of the Rules of 1983, qualified 5 years&#x27; continuous service as a teacher in the concerned subject on the date of occurrence of vacancy. After this amendment on 1.7.1983, Rule 9 provided consideration of all teachers working in L.T. grade or C.T. grade who possessed academic qualifications and have completed continuous teaching as teacher on the date of occurrence of vacancy to be considered for promotion to the Lecturer or L.T. grade as the case may be, without their having applied for the same. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"54635541\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/54635541/\" id=\"a_17\">Chandra Pratap Singh v. Madhav Saran Tripathi and others</a>, 1989 (1) UPLBEC 361, it was held that for promotion to the Lecturer or L.T. grade one has to possess minimum academic qualification and 5 years continuous service as a teacher on the date of occurrence of vacancy.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153319669\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1917331\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/1917331/\" id=\"a_18\">Harish Chand v.

District Inspector of Schools</a>, (2000) 3 UPLBEC 2155, the word &#x27;Regular&#x27; in Rule 14, came up for interpretation.</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       9. The Rules of 1998 made in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/21436551/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 35</a> of U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Act, 1982, replaced the Rules of 1995, and came into force on 8th August, 1998. The words &#x27;as such&#x27; in Rule 14, after the words five years&#x27; continuous regular service, qualify both to the qualification prescribed for the post and five years&#x27; continuous regular service. The legislature has once again brought in the eligibility to only those persons who possessed qualification for the post and completed 5 years&#x27; regular service with such qualifications. The words qualifications prescribed for the post and five years&#x27; continuous regular service have been used in the same sentence, which is a compound (double) sentence, as a demonstrative pronoun, (Latin word demonstrare, to show clearly), and points to the person who possesses the qualification prescribed for the post.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">       10. The petitioner was awarded M.A. degree in Political Science and Economics in the year 1970-72. She was, however, awarded M. A. degree in Hindi in the year 1999 in IIIrd Division. There is no averment in the writ petition that as a L.T. grade teacher she was taking classes in Hindi as a subject. She is three years junior in age to respondent No. 6. She did not have five years&#x27; continuous service with qualifications in Hindi and thus she was not eligible for promotion to the vacant post of Lecturer in Hindi in the year of recruitment. &quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_14\">11. The view taken in <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_21\">Smt. Usha Goel</a> (supra) was followed in a subsequent decision of learned Single Judge in <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_22\">Shail Kumari</a> (supra).</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_16\">While following the view taken in <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_23\">Smt.

The submission of the learned Counsel for the respondents that five years of continuous regular service cannot be equated with the qualification prescribed for the post is patently erroneous. The words five years of continuous regular service would qualify both to the qualification prescribed for the post as well as for five years of continuous regular service. Consequently, this Court is in complete agreement with the judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_25\">Smt. Usha Goel</a> (supra).&quot;</span>\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1982489\" id=\"span_20\">12. Rule 14 of the Rules of 1998 again fell for consideration before this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1982489/\" id=\"a_26\">Ram Prakash Sharma</a> (supra) wherein learned Single Judge doubted the correctness of the view taken in <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_27\">Smt. Usha Goel</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_28\">Shail Kumari</a> (supra) and held as under in paragraph nos.12 to 22:-</span></span></span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       &quot;12. So far as the 1998 Rules are concerned, the only change brought about is that the teaching experience of 5 years required under the earlier rules has been further clarified to mean teaching experience as a regular teacher. Meaning thereby that the services rendered on ad hoc basis as teacher in the lower grade are not to be counted for the purpose of computing 5 years teaching experience.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       13. From reading of <a href=\"/doc/92503551/\" id=\"a_29\">Regulation 6</a> of Chapter II and Rule 9 of the 1983 regulating promotion it will be seen that there was no explicit demarcation qua the teaching experience of working as L.T. grade or C.T. grade for the purpose of promotion to lecturer grade and L.T. grade respectively.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       14. In my opinion the use of word &#x27;as such&#x27; under 1995 Rules and 1998 Rules relate to the particular post from which the teacher concerned is to be promoted i.e. C.T. Grade or L.T. Grade as well as to the post on which the promotion is to be made i.e. L.T. Grade or Lecturers Grade as the case may be. To put it simply it means that a teacher in C.T. grade must be possessed 5 years continuous regular teaching experience alongwith essential qualifications prescribed for the post of L.T. grade teacher for being considered for promoting as L.T. grade teacher and similarly an L.T. grade teacher possessed of 5 years regular teaching experience as L.T. grade teacher and essential qualification prescribed for the post of Lecturer concerned is to be considered for promotion on the post of Lecturer.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_22\">15. It is not necessary that such teaching experience of 5 years must be from the date the candidate had acquired the minimum academic qualification qua the promotional post as has been held in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_30\">Usha Goyal</a> (supra) and as followed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_31\">Shail Kumari</a> (Supra).</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       16. On reading of the rules, as were existing earlier, it would be seen that it left, some reason to doubt qua the teaching experience to be possessed by the candidate concerned. It could be argued in a given case that a teacher, who was initially appointed as a teacher in C.T. Grade and subsequently appointed by direct recruitment as L.T. Grade could assert that for computing the 5 years of teaching experience under the Rules, the length of service rendered in CT grade be also counted, for promotion to Lecturer grade.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       17. For example, a teacher appointed in C.T. Grade in one particular institution and having worked as such for two years, on his subsequent appointment as a L.T. Grade teacher by direct recruitment in another recognized Intermediate College, on completing 3 years of service as L.T. grade teacher could claim that he had 5 years of teaching experience as contemplated under the Rules (prior to Rules of 1995) for promotion in Lecturers Grade.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       19. It is for the purpose of removing this ambiguity that amendments under the 1995 Rules have been made requiring the teacher concerned to be possessed of 5 years teaching experience of the post from which he is to be promoted and the qualification of the post on which he is to be promoted. The word &#x27;as such&#x27; only suggest that this 5 years teaching experience is to be possessed in the lower grade with reference to the post on which promotion is to be made.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       20. Another reason for the said conclusion is that earlier there was a requirement of 5 years teaching experience in the subject concerned, with reference to the promotional post. This requirement was deleted by the Legislature consciously under Rules 1983 as amended in 1986-87. No purpose is to be achieved by insisting upon the requirement of the teacher concerned to have worked for 5 year after achieving the qualifications qua the post on which he is to be promoted, when he is to continue to teach in the lower grade in a different subject.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       21. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_24\">In these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that the law as <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_32\">laid down in</a> the case of <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_33\">Usha Goel</a> (supra) as followed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_34\">Shail Kumari</a> (supra) requires to be examined by a Larger Bench of this Court.

In order to appreciate the true intent of expression &#x27;as such&#x27; occurring in Rule 14 of the Rules of 1998 it would be necessary to refer to the scheme for promotion of teachers under the Act of 1982 in Secondary Education Institution recognized under the Act of 1921. <a href=\"/doc/169562622/\" id=\"a_38\">The Act</a> of 1982 was passed by the U.P.

Rule 10 stipulates sources of recruitment to the post of teachers in different categories. Sub-rule (a) of Rule 10 specifies the post of Principal of an Intermediate College or Headmaster of a High School. This post is to be filled by direct recruitment. Then comes the post of teachers in Lecturers Grade. Recruitment on the post of Lecturers Grade is 50% by direct recruitment and 50% by promotion from amongst substantively appointed teachers of the Trained Graduates Grade. Sub-rule (c) refers to appointment of teachers of Trained Graduates Category by direct recruitment. 75% of posts of teachers of Trained Graduates Category are to be filled by direct recruitment and the rest 25% posts are to be filled through promotion of those trained graduate teachers of attached primary section who have completed satisfactory services of five years. The proviso contemplates that where there is no eligible candidate available for recruitment through promotion in any recruitment year the post may be filled through direct recruitment. Sub-rule (d) provides that teachers of attached primary section are to be entirely appointed by direct recruitment.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">    15. Rule 11 contemplates determination and notification of vacancies. The posts in trained graduates grade are to be advertised group-wise in accordance with eight groups specified therein. First group is of Language, which consists of the subjects Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian and Arabic; (b) Science Group consists of the subjects of Science and Mathematics. There are then separate groups of (c) Arts and Craft; (d) Music; (e) Agriculture; (f) Home Science; (g) Physical Education; and (h) General, which consists of the subjects not covered in any of the foregoing groups.   \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">    16. The scheme for determination and notification of vacancies as per Rule 11 as well as sources of recruitment<a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_44\">, <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_45\">referred to above</a></a>, as per the Rules of 1998 are similar to Rule 10 and 11 of the Rules of 1995. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">    17. It was only for the brief period between 10.1.1983 to 1.7.1983 that procedure for appointment by promotion to the post of Lecturer or L.T. Grade required possessing of minimum qualification and five years continuous service as teacher in the concerned subject on the date of occurrence of vacancy. This requirement of five years continuous service as a teacher in the concerned subject was specifically excluded after 1.7.1983.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">    18. The expression &#x27;as such&#x27; for the first time surfaced in Rule 14 of the Rules of 1995 specifying requirement of qualification prescribed for the post and the requirement of having five years continuous service on the first date of the year of recruitment in the feeding cadre.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">    19. In order to understand the view point of State on the import of Rule 14 of the Rules of 1995 we called upon the State Counsel to clarify the stand of State Government in the matter. The Special Secretary to the State has filed an affidavit on 01.03.2023 clarifying the stand of State Government in following words:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">       &quot;That it is pertinent to state here that the State Government, under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/21210184/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 14(1)</a> of the U.P. Secondary Education Service Selection Board Rules, 1998 for the purposes of promotion on the post of the Lecturers considers those Assistant Teachers (L.T. Grade), if any, who have completed five years continuous regular service and possesses the qualifications prescribed for the post on the first day of the year of recruitment. It is relevant to state here that according to this very procedure and as per the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Special Subordinate Educational (Lecturer&#x27;s Cadre) Service (First Amendment) Rules, 2016, the proceedings for promotion on the post of Lecturers in Government Inter Colleges are also adopted by the Commission.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">    20. Sri Neeraj Tripathi, learned Additional Advocate General, submits that the twin requirement for promotion under rule 14(1) of the Rules of 1998 is five years continuous regular service as also the qualification prescribed for the post on the first day of the year of recruitment. He contends that there is no requirement of five years continuous regular service with qualification for the promoted post under Rule 14.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">    21. Sri R. K. Ojha, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners takes up stand similar to that of the State as per which there is no requirement for the candidate to possess five years continuous regular service with the qualification for promotion under rule 14. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">    22. Sri Anil Tiwari, per contra, contends that the expression &#x27;as such&#x27; occurring in rule 14 qualifies both the ingredients i.e. qualification and five years continuous regular service for promotion. He submits that the five years continuous regular service has to be with the qualification for the post on which promotion is sought.  \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">    23. Rule 14, as it stands in the Rules of 1998 provides for recruitment by promotion in an institution. It regulates promotion to the post of teacher in lecturers grade or the trained graduate grade. The feeding cadre for promotion to the aforesaid posts is the trained graduates grade or certificate of teaching grade, as the case may be. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">    24. The criteria for promotion under rule 14 is seniority subject to rejection of unfit. By virtue of sub-rule (1) of rule 14 where any vacancy is to be filled by promotion all teachers working:- \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">       (i) in trained graduates grade or certificate of teaching grade, if any;\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">       (ii) who possess the qualifications, prescribed for the post and have completed five years continuous regular service, as such, on the first date of the year of recruitment shall be considered for promotion to the lecturers grade or the trained graduates grade, as the case may be, without having applied for the same. By virtue of note appended to rule 14(1) regular service rendered in any other recognized institution is to be counted for eligibility unless interrupted by removal, dismissal or reduction to a lower post.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">    25. Rule 10 of the Rules of 1998 while referring to source of recruitment refers to three distinct posts i.e. (a) Principal of an intermediate college; (b) Teachers of lecturers grade and; (c) Teachers of trained graduates grade. Specific quota for the three posts between direct recruitment and promotion is specified. Rule 11 contemplates determination of vacancies as per rule 10(1) and notify it to the Board through the inspector in appendix &#x27;A&#x27; alongwith the list of teachers eligible for promotion by virtue of rule 14(1) &amp; (3) of the Rules of 1998.",

State of\nU.P. &amp; Ors.1 along with other connected petitions were filed by certain\nlandholders whose land was acquired by NOIDA challenging the decision of the\nBoard of Directors of NOIDA dated 07.01.1998 as also the approval granted to\nthe said resolution by the State Government dated 02.03.2009 whereby a\ndistinction was carved out in the matter of payment of compensation by creating\na classification between “Pushtaini” and “Gair-pushtaini” landholders. The\n‘Pushtaini’ landholders whose lands were acquired, were given additional\ncompensation @ Rs.3 per sq. yard along with 15% as rehabilitation bonus on\nthe compensation already awarded, as also the 10% area of the acquired land,\nwhereas those who were declared as ‘Gair-pusht xcaini’ were denied this\nadditional benefit. A Division Bench of the High Court vide Judgment and\norder dated 10.05.2016 dismissed the Writ Petition holding the classification to\nbe reasonable having direct nexus with the object sought to be achieved i.e.,\nrehabilitation of the original residents who are likely to become landless due to\nthe acquisition of their land.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2.

    "input": "Before we enter into the factual matrix of the case, we find it expedient to\nfirst trace out the etymology of the words “Pushtaini” and “Gair Pushtaini” used\nin the impugned classification, for language, once adopted inside the realm of\nlaw, materializes itself a much more powerful being, one which must be\nunderstood in the right historical context.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">7.      The word ‘Pushtaini’ is a Persian word and finds its origin from the word\n‘Pusht’, which means ‘back’. The said word has been historically used in the\ncontext of ancestry. Any possession, tale or legend, that has roots to a particular\nancestry, to denote it’s significance to the said ancestry, the word ‘Pushtaini’ is\nused.    As is obvious, since the word ‘Gair’ which finds its origin in Urdu\nlanguage means ‘other than’, thus, ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ would mean one which is\nnot ‘Pushtaini’.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">8.      What we find most interesting however, is that ancestry as a concept,\nespecially before times of modern private property ownership, had remained to\nbe a tool for inclusivity and not exclusion. In such a context, the use of the word\n“Pushtaini” by the Authority, to exclude compensation might be a historically\ninaccurate interpretation. While this is not consequential to the merits of the\ncase, it is in our opinion a worthwhile observation, for law has to power to\nlegitimize the meaning of words and can change the context in which a word\nused, and in turn can change the course of history itself.",

A huge amount of\nmoney was infused in the Indian Economy with the purpose of developing\nIndian cities into massive global hubs of capital and business. In line with this,\nDelhi began its journey of becoming a global city. This influx of capital into the\ncity also brought with it massive employment opportunities, and people from all\nover the country started migrating to Delhi. To contain such influx of migrants\nand ensure dignified living for all who came to the city with the hopes of\nimproving their lives, the government of India planned to develop residential\nand industrial areas around the capital.

Some of the Petitioners submit that they propose to argue\nthat an unconditional stay, and subject only to the Petitioners&#x27;\nundertaking, should continue or be made in respect of delivery\norders. Ex facie that appears to us to be a difficult proposition to\naccept. Stamp duty is a taxing or a fiscal measure under a dedicated\nstatute. The payment is into revenue. Merely saying, as some\nPetitioners do, that they do not trust the Government is a less than\npersuasive argument. The remedies to that lie elsewhere and not in\na Writ Court.",

Learned counsel for the applicant and other members of the Bar have contended that:  \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(i). Age of a victim  has to be factored in while considering a bail application under <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_13\">POCSO Act</a> offences. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(ii). The accused can challenge the age of a victim in bail proceedings. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(iii). Attention is called to the liberal interpretation of the enquiry under <a href=\"/doc/187659331/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 94</a> of the JJ Act, 2015 by authorities in point. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(iv). The presumptions under <a href=\"/doc/187659331/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 94</a> of the JJ Act, 2015 and <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 29</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 can not prejudice the rights of an accused at the stage of bail.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(v). A large number of cases under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_17\">POCSO Act</a> relate to runaway couples, and arise from family opposition to such relationships. In bail application excluding evidence or limiting the challenge to the age of the victim which is often on the borderline of majority and at times false, would result in miscarriage of justice for the accused.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">Submissions on behalf of the State by learned AGA:        \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(i). <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_18\">POCSO Act</a> is a special Act where the legislature has made stringent provisions to protect the interests of victims who are minors. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(ii). <a href=\"/doc/187659331/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 94</a> of the JJ Act, 2015 shall be strictly interpreted and applied at the bail stage to implement the intent of the legislature. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(iii). The presumption of <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 29</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 is triggered at the lodgement of the F.I.R. otherwise its purpose will be defeated. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(iv).

If not what is the manner of assessing the age of a victim in a bail application under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_22\">POCSO Act</a> when a challenge is laid to it by an accused? \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">II. Whether the presumption of culpable intent under <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 29</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 is attracted against the accused at the stage of bail?\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">IV.

    "input": "Insofar as the words used ‘total income’ in <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_47\">section\n  153A</a> of the Act, 1961, it is submitted that before\n  insertion of the new scheme of assessment under\n  Section   153A,       there   was   a   concept   of   block\n  assessment in respect of the search period. There was\n  one assessment for the block period in respect of the\n  undisclosed income found during the search.            This\n  undisclosed income was being taxed at a special rate of\n  60% and that is why, such income was being identified\n  separately as against the regular income for each of the\n  assessment year. The above concept was given a go-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">  by on introducing this new scheme of assessment\n  under section 153A which provided that assessment\n  will be made for each of the assessment year\n  separately and the income found undisclosed during\n  the search will be taxed at the normal rate. Hence, in\n  section 153A, it has been stated that ‘total income&#x27; will\n  be assessed. This means that while computing tax\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.                                            Page 34 of 59</span>\n\f  liability, income disclosed as well as undisclosed\n  income found during the course of search will be\n  clubbed to determine the ‘total income’ and tax to be\n  computed on the basis of such ‘total income’. Thus, on\n  the basis of the expression &#x27;total income&#x27; in section\n  153A, the contention of the Revenue that the AO gets\n  power to assess ‘total income’ which will include even\n  income without there being any incriminating material\n  found during the search in respect of assessments\n  which have not abated is not tenable. It is submitted\n  that the meaning of the expression ‘total income’ here\n  will be income originally assessed and the income\n  found during the course of the search. On the basis of\n  this expression &#x27;total income’, the AO cannot get\n  jurisdiction to make an assessment in respect of other\n  material available on record despite no incriminating\n  material being found during the course of the search. It\n  is submitted that therefore when the purpose of the\n  search is to collect information and in case no material\n  is found in the search for the particular assessment\n  year, there is no justification for tinkering with the\n  unabated assessment. It is submitted that therefore in\n  case no incriminating material is found during the\n  search, that jurisdiction comes to an end and AO\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.                                        Page 35 of 59</span>\n\f  cannot use that opportunity to bring to tax income on\n  the basis of the material available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">  xvi)      It is submitted that further as per sub-section\n  (2) of section 153A of the if any proceeding or any order\n  of assessment or reassessment made under sub-\n  section (1) is annulled in appeal or any other legal\n  provision, then the assessment or reassessment\n  relating to any assessment year which had abated\n  under the second proviso would stand revived. It is\n  submitted that only the proceedings that have been\n  abated shall be revived. The proceedings for other\n  assessment years are not revived even if there is any\n  income    that   has   escaped   assessment.     Meaning\n  thereby, that intention of the legislation is to only give\n  power to AO for making assessments, which he was\n  earlier having in respect of assessments, which were\n  pending as on date of search and not the other\n  assessments. It is submitted that had the intention of\n  legislature as is being contended On behalf of the\n  Revenue that AO has power to make additions in those\n  assessment years where there is no incriminating\n  material, the legislature would have provided that in\n  case of annulled assessments, in the case of unabated\n  assessments, the AO shall on the basis of the additions\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.

The second proviso makes the intention\n  of the Legislature clear as the same provides that\n  assessment or reassessment, if any, relating to the six\n  assessment years referred to in the sub-section pending on\n  the date of initiation of search under section 132 or\n  requisition under section 132A, as the case may be, shall\n  abate.

The\n  proviso thereto says, that such revival shall cease to have\n  effect if such order of annulment is set aside. Thus, any\n  proceeding of assessment or reassessment falling within the,\n  six assessment years prior to the search or requisition stands\n  abated and the total income of the assessee is required to be\n  determined under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_77\">section 153A</a>, of the Act. Similarly, sub-\n  section (2) provides for revival of any assessment or\n  reassessment which stood abated, if any proceeding or any\n  order of assessment or reassessment made under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_78\">section\n  153A</a> of, the Act is annulled in appeal or any other\n  proceeding.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">  16.

When, the very purpose of the provision is to\n  make assessment in case of search or requisition, it goes\n  without saying that the assessment has to have relation to\n  the search or requisition. In other words, the assessment,\n  should be connected with something found during the search\n  or requisition, viz., incriminating material which reveals\n  undisclosed income Thus, while in view of the mandate of\n  sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_79\">section 153A</a> of the Act, in every case\n  where there is a search or requisition, the Assessing Officer\n  is obliged to issue notice to such person to furnish returns of\n  income for the six years preceding the assessment year\n  relevant to the previous year in which the search is\n  conducted or requisition is made, any addition or\n  disallowance can be made only on the basis of material\n  collected during the search or requisition. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73963141\" id=\"span_62\">In case no\n  incriminating material is found, as held by the Rajasthan High\n  Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/73963141/\" id=\"a_80\">Jai Steel (India) v.

While considering the issue involved, one has to\nconsider the object and purpose of insertion of Section\n153A in the Act, 1961 and when there shall be a block\nassessment under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 153A</a> of the Act, 1961.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">9.1   That prior to insertion of Section 153A in the statute,\nthe relevant provision for block assessment was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\"><a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 158BA</a> of the Act, 1961. The erstwhile scheme of\nblock assessment under Section 158BA envisaged\nassessment of ‘undisclosed income’ for two reasons,\nfirstly that there were two parallel assessments envisaged\nunder the erstwhile regime, i.e., (i) block assessment\nunder section 158BA to assess the ‘undisclosed income’\nand (ii) regular assessment in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Act to make assessment qua income\nother than undisclosed income.         Secondly, that the\n‘undisclosed income’ was chargeable to tax at a special\nrate of 60% under section 113 whereas income other than\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">CA No. 6580/2021 Etc.                                           Page 48 of 59</span>\n\f‘undisclosed income’ was required to be assessed under\nregular assessment procedure and was taxable at normal\nrate. Therefore, section 153A came to be inserted and\nbrought on the statute. Under Section 153A regime, the\nintention of the legislation was to do away with the\nscheme of two parallel assessments and tax the\n‘undisclosed’ income too at the normal rate of tax as\nagainst any special rate.         Thus, after introduction of\nSection 153A and in case of search, there shall be block\nassessment for six years.         Search assessments/block\nassessments under Section 153A are triggered by\nconducting of a valid search under <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 132</a> of the Act,\n1961.     The   very    purpose    of   search,   which   is   a\nprerequisite/trigger for invoking the provisions of sections\n153A/153C is detection of undisclosed income by\nundertaking extraordinary power of search and seizure,\ni.e., the income which cannot be detected in ordinary\ncourse of regular assessment. Thus, the foundation for\nmaking search assessments under Sections 153A/153C\ncan be said to be the existence of incriminating material\nshowing undisclosed income detected as a result of\nsearch.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">10.

Therefore, only in a case where the\nundisclosed income is found on the basis of incriminating\nmaterial, the AO would assume the jurisdiction to assess\nor reassess the total income for the entire six years block\nassessment period even in case of completed/unabated\nassessment.

By\n\nway of the impugned judgment, the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan\n\nMunicipality and the concerned authority in Ranaghat and Habra\n\nMunicipalities were directed to consider the application made by the\n\nWrit Petitioners seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court also identified the scheme in light of\n\nwhich the said applications would have to be considered and decided.\n\nHence the present appeals by the State of West Bengal.\n\n\n2.10. The pertinent findings of the Division Bench of the High Court of\n\nCalcutta, in the common impugned judgment dated 30th September,\n\n2019, have been culled out hereinunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> i.   The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the argument\n\n      canvassed on behalf of the Government that there was an undue\n\n      delay between the time of making the application and the time\n\n      when the Respondents-Writ Petitioners approached the Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n\n      That the Writ Petitioners had not delayed filing applications\n\n      seeking appointments on compassionate grounds and the\n\n      concerned authorities had undertaken an enquiry by constituting\n\n      a committee but had ultimately taken years to consider their\n\n      applications and to recommend their respective names. The\n\n      Director of Local Bodies kept the matter pending without\n\n      according any approval of the recommendations, as a result, a\n\n      Writ Petition was filed which was disposed of with a specific\n\n      direction to the Director of Local Bodies to consider the\n\n      applications within a time frame. That in pursuance of the High\n\n      Court direction, the Director of Local Bodies disposed of the\n\n      matter in respect of Burdwan Municipality only on 16th October,\n\n      2015. Hence, a time of about ten years had been spent only for\n\n      processing the applications and such a delay could not be\n\n      attributed to the Respondents-Writ Petitioners.\n\nii.   That an employee of a municipality cannot be treated as an\n\n      employee of the State Government and therefore the scheme\n\n      available to a State Government employee cannot be extended to\n\n      a dependent of an employee of the municipality who died in\n\n      harness. Thus, the respondents were not entitled to claim the\n\n      benefit of compassionate appointment in terms of the schemes\n\n      formulated vide Circular No. 97-Emp.; 142-Emp.; 30-Emp.; and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                     8</span>\n\n\n       251-Emp., which were specifically applicable to State Government\n\n       employees.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">iii.   As to the issue of whether there was any scheme for grant of\n\n       compassionate    appointments     in   respect    of     employees   of\n\n       Municipalities, the Division Bench differed from the findings of the\n\n       Single Judge. On a conjoint reading of Circular Nos. 301-Emp.,\n\n       302-Emp. and 303 Emp., it was observed that it was clear that\n\n       the aforesaid Circulars were specific schemes for compassionate\n\n       appointments in respect of municipalities. That the said schemes\n\n       were in respect of all establishments covered under the <a href=\"/doc/92054927/\" id=\"a_3\">West\n\n       Bengal   Regulation    of   Recruitment   in     State    Government\n\n       Establishments and Establishments of Public Undertakings,\n\n       Statutory Bodies, Government Companies and Local Authorities\n\n       Act, 1999</a> (West Bengal Act XIV of 1999) (hereinafter referred to as\n\n       the ‘Act of 1999’ for the sake of brevity). That the said circulars\n\n       which were extended to the employees of all establishments\n\n       including local authorities like municipalities, were neither\n\n       withdrawn nor substituted by the subsequent notifications and\n\n       circulars.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">iv.    That although Circular No. 142-Emp. clarified that 97-Emp. was\n\n       applicable only in respect of State Government employees and\n\n       directed the municipalities to formulate their own schemes for\n\n       compassionate    appointment,     no   such      scheme     had   been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                  9</span>\n\n\n     formulated by the concerned municipalities. That it was evident\n\n     from Circular No. 142-Emp. that it does not withdraw the scheme\n\n     for compassionate appointment available under Circular Nos.\n\n     301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp. and in the absence of any\n\n     subsequent scheme or specific withdrawal of the existing scheme,\n\n     the scheme remains in subsistence and will be the scheme under\n\n     which the applications for compassionate appointments made by\n\n     the respondents are to be considered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">v.   In the absence of a substituted scheme, and given that Circular\n\n     No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were not specifically\n\n     withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable. Therefore,\n\n     compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities would be\n\n     governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp.\n\n     and 303-Emp.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          In light of the aforesaid observations, the Division Bench of\n\n     the High Court set aside the Order passed by the Single Judge\n\n     and directed the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan Division,\n\n     Government of West Bengal to reconsider the Memo dated 12th\n\n     June, 2013 whereby the Chairman, Burdwan Municipality, had\n\n     sought for the approval of recommended names for being\n\n     appointed under compassionate grounds. Further, the Director of\n\n     Local Bodies was directed to examine whether proper inspection\n\n     of the documents had been carried out while recommending such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                   10</span>\n\n\n     names and whether the parameters mentioned under the scheme\n\n     contained in Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp.\n\n     had been properly adhered to by the officials of Burdwan\n\n     Municipality while making the recommendation.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           Aggrieved by the said directions of the High Court and the\n\n     findings as to the eligibility of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners to\n\n     seek appointment on compassionate grounds, the present appeals\n\n     have been filed by the State of West Bengal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">3.   We have heard Sri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel and\n\nlearned counsel, Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Appellant-State of West Bengal and learned counsel Sri Indradeep\n\nPal for the Respondent-Writ Petitioners, and perused the material on\n\nrecord.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\nSubmissions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">4.

It was further submitted that directing at such a belated stage,\n\nthat the Respondents-Writ Petitioners ought to be appointed on\n\ncompassionate grounds would have no redeeming purpose.

Aggrieved by the Order passed by the Single Judge dated 5th July,\n\n2018, the Respondents- Writ Petitioners preferred a batch of appeals\n\nbefore the Division Bench of the High Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10390840\" id=\"span_10\">The said appeals were\n\nheard and allowed by a common impugned judgement dated 30th\n\nSeptember, 2019, passed in MAT 859 of 2018 with CAN 6137 of 2018\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/10390840/\" id=\"a_2\">Debabrata Tiwari vs. The State of West Bengal</a>. By\n\nway of the impugned judgment, the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan\n\nMunicipality and the concerned authority in Ranaghat and Habra\n\nMunicipalities were directed to consider the application made by the\n\nWrit Petitioners seeking appointment on compassionate grounds. The\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court also identified the scheme in light of\n\nwhich the said applications would have to be considered and decided.\n\nHence the present appeals by the State of West Bengal.\n\n\n2.10. The pertinent findings of the Division Bench of the High Court of\n\nCalcutta, in the common impugned judgment dated 30th September,\n\n2019, have been culled out hereinunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> i.   The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the argument\n\n      canvassed on behalf of the Government that there was an undue\n\n      delay between the time of making the application and the time\n\n      when the Respondents-Writ Petitioners approached the Court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n\n      That the Writ Petitioners had not delayed filing applications\n\n      seeking appointments on compassionate grounds and the\n\n      concerned authorities had undertaken an enquiry by constituting\n\n      a committee but had ultimately taken years to consider their\n\n      applications and to recommend their respective names. The\n\n      Director of Local Bodies kept the matter pending without\n\n      according any approval of the recommendations, as a result, a\n\n      Writ Petition was filed which was disposed of with a specific\n\n      direction to the Director of Local Bodies to consider the\n\n      applications within a time frame. That in pursuance of the High\n\n      Court direction, the Director of Local Bodies disposed of the\n\n      matter in respect of Burdwan Municipality only on 16th October,\n\n      2015. Hence, a time of about ten years had been spent only for\n\n      processing the applications and such a delay could not be\n\n      attributed to the Respondents-Writ Petitioners.\n\nii.   That an employee of a municipality cannot be treated as an\n\n      employee of the State Government and therefore the scheme\n\n      available to a State Government employee cannot be extended to\n\n      a dependent of an employee of the municipality who died in\n\n      harness. Thus, the respondents were not entitled to claim the\n\n      benefit of compassionate appointment in terms of the schemes\n\n      formulated vide Circular No. 97-Emp.; 142-Emp.; 30-Emp.; and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                     8</span>\n\n\n       251-Emp., which were specifically applicable to State Government\n\n       employees.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">iii.   As to the issue of whether there was any scheme for grant of\n\n       compassionate    appointments     in   respect    of     employees   of\n\n       Municipalities, the Division Bench differed from the findings of the\n\n       Single Judge. On a conjoint reading of Circular Nos. 301-Emp.,\n\n       302-Emp. and 303 Emp., it was observed that it was clear that\n\n       the aforesaid Circulars were specific schemes for compassionate\n\n       appointments in respect of municipalities. That the said schemes\n\n       were in respect of all establishments covered under the <a href=\"/doc/92054927/\" id=\"a_3\">West\n\n       Bengal   Regulation    of   Recruitment   in     State    Government\n\n       Establishments and Establishments of Public Undertakings,\n\n       Statutory Bodies, Government Companies and Local Authorities\n\n       Act, 1999</a> (West Bengal Act XIV of 1999) (hereinafter referred to as\n\n       the ‘Act of 1999’ for the sake of brevity). That the said circulars\n\n       which were extended to the employees of all establishments\n\n       including local authorities like municipalities, were neither\n\n       withdrawn nor substituted by the subsequent notifications and\n\n       circulars.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">iv.    That although Circular No. 142-Emp. clarified that 97-Emp. was\n\n       applicable only in respect of State Government employees and\n\n       directed the municipalities to formulate their own schemes for\n\n       compassionate    appointment,     no   such      scheme     had   been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                  9</span>\n\n\n     formulated by the concerned municipalities. That it was evident\n\n     from Circular No. 142-Emp. that it does not withdraw the scheme\n\n     for compassionate appointment available under Circular Nos.\n\n     301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp. and in the absence of any\n\n     subsequent scheme or specific withdrawal of the existing scheme,\n\n     the scheme remains in subsistence and will be the scheme under\n\n     which the applications for compassionate appointments made by\n\n     the respondents are to be considered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">v.   In the absence of a substituted scheme, and given that Circular\n\n     No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were not specifically\n\n     withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable. Therefore,\n\n     compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities would be\n\n     governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp.\n\n     and 303-Emp.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">          In light of the aforesaid observations, the Division Bench of\n\n     the High Court set aside the Order passed by the Single Judge\n\n     and directed the Director of Local Bodies, Burdwan Division,\n\n     Government of West Bengal to reconsider the Memo dated 12th\n\n     June, 2013 whereby the Chairman, Burdwan Municipality, had\n\n     sought for the approval of recommended names for being\n\n     appointed under compassionate grounds. Further, the Director of\n\n     Local Bodies was directed to examine whether proper inspection\n\n     of the documents had been carried out while recommending such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                   10</span>\n\n\n     names and whether the parameters mentioned under the scheme\n\n     contained in Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp.\n\n     had been properly adhered to by the officials of Burdwan\n\n     Municipality while making the recommendation.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           Aggrieved by the said directions of the High Court and the\n\n     findings as to the eligibility of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners to\n\n     seek appointment on compassionate grounds, the present appeals\n\n     have been filed by the State of West Bengal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">3.

That a\n\ndirection to act on the same now, i.e., 17-18 years after the applications\n\nseeking compassionate appointment were made, would not further the\n\nobject of a scheme of compassionate appointment.\n\n\n4.2. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/179866913/\" id=\"a_4\">State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh vs. Shashi Kumar</a>, (2019) 3 SCC 653 (“Shashi\n\nKumar”) to contend that where there is a significant gap between\n\nmaking the application for compassionate appointment and filing a Writ\n\nPetition to challenge inaction on the part of the Government, a direction\n\nto consider the application for compassionate appointment may not be\n\nissued.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">\n4.3. It was next contended that Circular No. 142-Emp. clarified that\n\n97-Emp. was applicable only in respect of State Government employees\n\nand directed the municipalities to formulate their own schemes for\n\ncompassionate appointment. This would mean that as a matter of policy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                   12</span>\n\n\nof the State Government, it was declared that it is not viable to give\n\ncompassionate appointment to heirs of employees of establishments of\n\npublic undertakings, statutory bodies, government companies and local\n\nauthorities. That by virtue of the clarification under Circular No. 142-\n\nEmp., the position would be that no scheme exists for compassionate\n\nappointment in Municipalities. It is for such establishments to\n\nformulate policies of their own in consultation with the respective\n\nadministrative department. That, in the absence of a sanctioned scheme\n\nfor compassionate appointment in respect of municipal employees, no\n\nrelief could have been granted by the High Court.\n\n\n4.4. It was urged that compassionate appointment could not be\n\nclaimed as a matter of right and a claim for the same must be\n\nentertained having regard to the compelling financial circumstances (if\n\nany) of the deceased’s dependent(s).

However, by way of\n\nNotification bearing No. 142-Emp. dated 1st November, 2007 it was\n\nclarified that Notification No. 97-Emp. was only restricted to State\n\nGovernment employees, and in so far as other establishments are\n\nconcerned, they would have to formulate their own policies having\n\nregard to the principles applicable to the State Government Employees.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">      That in the absence of a policy formulated specially for municipal\n\nemployees, compassionate appointment could have been granted on the\n\nstrength of Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp.\n\n\n5.3. It was averred that since delay in acting upon the application of\n\nthe Respondent-Writ Petitioners was attributable only to the appellant’s\n\nauthorities, therefore, the Respondents ought not to be prejudiced on\n\naccount of such delay.

These appeals primarily concern the question whether there exists\n\nany scheme in the State of West Bengal, governing compassionate\n\nappointment governing municipal employees dying in harness. In the\n\nevent that the aforesaid question is answered in the affirmative, it would\n\nbe necessary to determine whether a direction issued several years after\n\napplications for compassionate appointment are filled, to consider and\n\ndecide such applications, is in consonance with the object of a\n\npolicy/scheme for compassionate appointment.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">Policy of Compassionate Appointment: The Rationale:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">7.    The majesty of death is that it is a great leveller for, it makes no\n\ndistinction between the young and the old or the rich and the poor.\n\nDeath being as a consequence of birth at some point of time is inevitable\n\nfor every being. Thus, while death is certain, its timing is uncertain.\n\nFurther, a deceased employee does not always leave behind valuable\n\nassets; he may at times leave behind poverty to be faced by the\n\nimmediate members of his family. Therefore, what should be done to\n\nensure that death of an individual does not mean economic death for\n\nhis family?

In Shashi Kumar, this Court speaking through Dr. D.Y.\n\n       Chandrachud, J. (as His Lordship then was) observed that\n\n       compassionate appointment is an exception to the general rule\n\n       that appointment to any public post in the service of the State has\n\n       to be made on the basis of principles which accord with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles\n\n       14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_16\">16</a> of the Constitution. That the basis of the policy is that\n\n       it recognizes that a family of a deceased employee may be placed\n\n       in a position of financial hardship upon the untimely death of the\n\n       employee while in service. That it is the immediacy of the need\n\n       which furnishes the basis for the State to allow the benefit of\n\n       compassionate appointment. The pertinent observations of this\n\n       Court have been extracted as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">             “41. Insofar as the individual facts pertaining to the\n             Respondent are concerned, it has emerged from the\n             record that the Writ Petition before the High Court was\n             instituted on 11 May 2015. The application for\n             compassionate appointment was submitted on 8 May\n             2007. On 15 January 2008 the Additional Secretary\n             had required that the amount realized by way of\n             pension be included in the income statement of the\n             family. The Respondent waited thereafter for a period\n             in excess of seven years to move a petition Under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article\n             226</a> of the Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1737552\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/1737552/\" id=\"a_18\">Umesh Kumar Nagpal</a>\n             (supra), this Court has emphasized that the basis of a\n             scheme of compassionate appointment lies in the need\n             of providing immediate assistance to the family of the\n             deceased employee. This sense of immediacy is\n             evidently lost by the delay on the part of the dependant\n             in seeking compassionate appointment.”\n\n\n7.2. On consideration of the aforesaid decisions of this Court, the\n\nfollowing principles emerge:</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                      21</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\"> i.    That a provision for compassionate appointment makes a\n\n       departure from the general provisions providing for appointment\n\n       to a post by following a particular procedure of recruitment. Since\n\n       such a provision enables appointment being made without\n\n       following the said procedure, it is in the nature of an exception to\n\n       the general provisions and must be resorted to only in order to\n\n       achieve the stated objectives, i.e., to enable the family of the\n\n       deceased to get over the sudden financial crisis.\n\nii.    Appointment on compassionate grounds is not a source of\n\n       recruitment. The reason for making such a benevolent scheme by\n\n       the State or the public sector undertaking is to see that the\n\n       dependants of the deceased are not deprived of the means of\n\n       livelihood. It only enables the family of the deceased to get over\n\n       the sudden financial crisis.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">iii.   Compassionate appointment is not a vested right which can be\n\n       exercised at any time in future. Compassionate employment\n\n       cannot be claimed or offered after a lapse of time and after the\n\n       crisis is over.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">iv.    That compassionate appointment should be provided immediately\n\n       to redeem the family in distress. It is improper to keep such a case\n\n       pending for years.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\"> v.    In determining as to whether the family is in financial crisis, all\n\n       relevant aspects must be borne in mind including the income of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                    22</span>\n\n\n     the family, its liabilities, the terminal benefits if any, received by\n\n     the family, the age, dependency and marital status of its members,\n\n     together with the income from any other source.\n\n\n7.3. The object underlying a provision for grant of compassionate\n\nemployment is to enable the family of the deceased employee to tide over\n\nthe sudden crisis due to the death of the bread-earner which has left\n\nthe family in penury and without any means of livelihood. Out of pure\n\nhumanitarian consideration and having regard to the fact that unless\n\nsome source of livelihood is provided, the family would not be in a\n\nposition to make both ends meet, a provision is made for giving gainful\n\nappointment to one of the dependants of the deceased who may be\n\neligible for such appointment. Having regard to such an object, it would\n\nbe of no avail to grant compassionate appointment to the dependants of\n\nthe deceased employee, after the crisis which arose on account of death\n\nof a bread-winner, has been overcome. Thus, there is also a compelling\n\nneed to act with a sense of immediacy in matters concerning\n\ncompassionate appointment because on failure to do so, the object of\n\nthe scheme of compassionate would be frustrated. Where a long lapse\n\nof time has occurred since the date of death of the deceased employee,\n\nthe sense of immediacy for seeking compassionate appointment would\n\ncease to exist and thus lose its significance and this would be a relevant\n\ncircumstance which must weigh with the authorities in determining as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                    23</span>\n\n\nto whether a case for the grant of compassionate appointment has been\n\nmade out for consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\n7.4. As noted above, the sine qua non for entertaining a claim for\n\ncompassionate appointment is that the family of the deceased employee\n\nwould be unable to make two ends meet without one of the dependants\n\nof the deceased employee being employed on compassionate grounds.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">The financial condition of the family of the deceased, at the time of the\n\ndeath of the deceased, is the primary consideration that ought to guide\n\nthe authorities’ decision in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">\n7.5. Considering the second question <a href=\"/doc/1737552/\" id=\"a_19\">referred to above</a>, in the first\n\ninstance,   regarding    whether    applications   for   compassionate\n\nappointment could be considered after a delay of several years, we are\n\nof the view that, in a case where, for reasons of prolonged delay, either\n\non the part of the applicant in claiming compassionate appointment or\n\nthe authorities in deciding such claim, the sense of immediacy is diluted\n\nand lost. Further, the financial circumstances of the family of the\n\ndeceased, may have changed, for the better, since the time of the death\n\nof the government employee. In such circumstances, Courts or other\n\nrelevant authorities are to be guided by the fact that for such prolonged\n\nperiod of delay, the family of the deceased was able to sustain\n\nthemselves, most probably by availing gainful employment from some\n\nother source. Granting compassionate appointment in such a case, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                   24</span>\n\n\nnoted by this Court in Hakim Singh would amount to treating a claim\n\nfor compassionate appointment as though it were a matter of\n\ninheritance based on a line of succession which is contrary to the\n\nConstitution. Since compassionate appointment is not a vested right\n\nand the same is relative to the financial condition and hardship faced\n\nby the dependents of the deceased government employee as a\n\nconsequence of his death, a claim for compassionate appointment may\n\nnot be entertained after lapse of a considerable period of time since the\n\ndeath of the government employee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">8.   Laches or undue delay, the blame-worthy conduct of a person in\n\napproaching a Court of Equity in England for obtaining discretionary\n\nrelief which disentitled him for grant of such relief was explained\n\nsuccinctly by Sir Barnes Peacock, in Lindsay Petroleum Co. vs.\n\nProsper Armstrong, (1874) 3 PC 221 as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96294865\" id=\"span_39\">“Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not\n         an arbitrary or a technical doctrine. Where it would be\n         practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the\n         party has, by his conduct, done that which might\n         fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or\n         where by his conduct and neglect he has, though\n         perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other\n         party in a situation, in which it would not be\n         reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards\n         to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time\n         and delay are most material. But in every case, if an\n         argument against relief, which otherwise would be\n         just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course\n         not amounting to a bar by any statute or limitations,\n         the validity of that defence must be tried upon\n         principles      substantially       equitable.     Two\n         circumstances, always important in such cases, are,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                    25</span>\n\n\n         the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done\n         during the interval, which might affect either party\n         and cause a balance of Justice or injustice in taking\n         the one course or the other, so far as it relates to the\n         remedy.”\n\n     Whether the above doctrine of laches which disentitled grant of\n\nrelief to a party by Equity Court of England, could disentitle the grant\n\nof relief to a person by the High Court in the exercise of its power under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 226</a> of our Constitution, came up for consideration before a\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/96294865/\" id=\"a_21\">Moon Mills Ltd. vs. M.

It was stated that this Rule is\n         premised on a number of factors.

In fact, such a prolonged delay in\n\napproaching the High Court, may even be regarded as a waiver of a\n\nremedy, as discernible by the conduct of the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners. Such a delay would disentitle the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners to the discretionary relief under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution. Further, the order of the High Court dated 17 th March,\n\n2015, whereby the writ petition filed by some of the Respondents herein\n\nwas disposed of with a direction to the Director of Local Bodies,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal to take a decision as to the appointment of\n\nthe Respondents-Writ Petitioners, cannot be considered to have the\n\neffect of revival of the cause of action.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"170758798\" id=\"span_47\">11.   It may be apposite at this juncture to refer to the following\n\nobservations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/170758798/\" id=\"a_29\">Malaya Nanda Sethy vs. State of Orissa</a>,\n\nAIR 2022 SC 2836, as to the manner in which the authorities must\n\nconsider and decide applications for appointment on compassionate\n\ngrounds:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">           “9. Before parting with the present order, we are\n           constrained to observe that considering the object and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                        28</span>\n\n\npurpose of appointment on compassionate grounds,\ni.e., a family of a deceased employee may be placed in\na position of financial hardship upon the untimely\ndeath of the employee while in service and the basis\nor policy is immediacy in rendering of financial\nassistance to the family of the deceased\nconsequent upon his untimely death, the\nauthorities must consider and decide such\napplications for appointment on compassionate\ngrounds as per the policy prevalent, at the earliest,\nbut not beyond a period of six months from the\ndate      of    submission    of   such     completed\napplications.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">         We are constrained to direct as above as we\nhave found that in several cases, applications for\nappointment on compassionate grounds are not\nattended in time and are kept pending for years\ntogether. As a result, the applicants in several cases\nhave to approach the concerned High Courts seeking\na writ of Mandamus for the consideration of their\napplications. Even after such a direction is issued,\nfrivolous or vexatious reasons are given for rejecting\nthe applications. Once again, the applicants have to\nchallenge the order of rejection before the High Court\nwhich leads to pendency of litigation and passage of\ntime, leaving the family of the employee who died in\nharness in the lurch and in financial difficulty.\nFurther, for reasons best known to the authorities and\non irrelevant considerations, applications made for\ncompassionate appointment are rejected. After several\nyears or are not considered at all as in the instant\ncase.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">         If the object and purpose of appointment on\ncompassionate grounds as envisaged under the\nrelevant policies or the rules have to be achieved\nthen it is just and necessary that such applications\nare considered well in time and not in a tardy way.\nWe have come across cases where for nearly two\ndecades the controversy regarding the application\nmade for compassionate appointment is not resolved.\nThis consequently leads to the frustration of the very\npolicy of granting compassionate appointment on the\ndeath of the employee while in service. We have,\ntherefore, directed that such applications must be\nconsidered at an earliest point of time. The\nconsideration must be fair, reasonable and based on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                    29</span>\n\n\n          relevant consideration. The application cannot be\n          rejected on the basis of frivolous and for reasons\n          extraneous to the facts of the case. Then and then only\n          the object and purpose of appointment on\n          compassionate grounds can be achieved.”\n\n                                               (emphasis by us)\n\n     In the said case, the claim of the appellant-applicant therein for\n\ncompassionate appointment was directed by this Court to be considered\n\nby the competent authority. This Court noted that in the said case, there\n\nwas no lapse on the part of the appellant-applicant therein in diligently\n\npursuing the matter. The delay in considering the application of the\n\nappellant therein was held to be solely attributable to the authorities of\n\nthe State, and no part of it was occasioned by the appellant-applicant.\n\nFurther, in the said case, the appellant-applicant was prejudiced not\n\nonly because of the prolonged delay in considering his application but\n\nalso by the fact that in the interim, the policy of the State governing\n\ncompassionate appointment had changed to his detriment. Therefore,\n\nthe facts of the said case were distinct from the facts involved herein. In\n\nthe present case, the conduct of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners\n\ncannot be said to be blameless in that they did not pursue their matter\n\nwith sufficient diligence. However, the observations made in the said\n\ncase as to the manner in which applications for compassionate\n\nappointment are to be considered and disposed of are relevant to the\n\npresent case.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                          30</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       As noted in the said case, the operation of a policy/scheme for\n\ncompassionate appointment is founded on considerations of immediacy.\n\nA sense of immediacy is called for not only in the manner in which the\n\napplications are processed by the concerned authorities but also in the\n\nconduct of the applicant in pursuing his case, before the authorities and\n\nif needed before the Courts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">12.    In     the   present   case,     the    applications    for   compassionate\n\nappointment were made by the Respondents-Writ Petitioners in the year\n\n2005-2006. Admittedly, the first concrete step taken by the Chairman\n\nof the Burdwan Municipality was in the year 2013, when the said\n\nauthority forwarded a list of candidates to be approved by the Director\n\nof    Local    Bodies,   Burdwan        Municipality.    The    Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners knocked on the doors of the High Court of Calcutta only in\n\nthe year 2015, i.e., after a lapse of nearly ten years from the date of\n\nmaking        the   application   for     compassionate        appointment.   The\n\nRespondents-Writ Petitioners were not prudent enough to approach the\n\nCourts sooner, claiming that no concrete step had been taken by the\n\nAppellant-State in furtherance of the application by seeking a Writ in\n\nthe nature of Mandamus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">13.    The sense of immediacy in the matter of compassionate\n\nappointment has been lost in the present case. This is attributable to\n\nthe authorities of the Appellant-State as well as the Respondents-Writ\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                   31</span>\n\n\nPetitioners. Now, entertaining a claim which was made in 2005-2006,\n\nin the year 2023, would be of no avail, because admittedly, the\n\nRespondents-Writ Petitioners have been able to eke out a living even\n\nthough they did not successfully get appointed to the services of the\n\nMunicipality on compassionate grounds. Hence, we think that this is\n\ntherefore not fit cases to direct that the claim of the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners for appointments on compassionate grounds, be considered\n\nor entertained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">14.   However, we must sound a strong word of reproach directed at the\n\nauthorities of the Appellant-State, about the manner in which the\n\napplications for compassionate appointment of hundreds of dependents\n\nhave been dealt with. Much uncertainty looms around the scope, extent\n\nand beneficiaries of the various schemes formulated by the State for\n\ngoverning compassionate appointment and therefore, the concerned\n\nauthorities are unable/unwilling to positively decide claims for\n\ncompassionate appointment. This may have ultimately resulted in\n\nprejudice to the families of many government employees dying in\n\nharness. Delay on the part of the authorities of the State to decide\n\nclaims for compassionate appointment would no doubt frustrate the\n\nvery object of a scheme of compassionate appointment. Government\n\nofficials are to act with a sense of utmost proactiveness and immediacy\n\nwhile deciding claims of compassionate appointment so as to ensure\n\nthat the wholesome object of such a scheme is fulfilled.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                   32</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">15.   The question as to whether a direction issued several years after\n\nan application for compassionate appointment, to consider and decide\n\nsuch application, is in consonance with the object of a policy/scheme\n\nfor compassionate appointment, has been answered in the negative.\n\nHowever, we shall also examine whether these appeals must succeed\n\non a second count, i.e., whether there exists any scheme in the State of\n\nWest Bengal, governing compassionate appointment vis-à-vis municipal\n\nemployees dying in harness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">16.   In order to determine the question as to whether there exists any\n\nscheme in the State of West Bengal, governing compassionate\n\nappointment vis-à-vis municipal employees dying in harness, it would\n\nbe useful to refer to the content of the relevant State Government\n\nNotifications issued in this regard.

It merely defines the scope of operation of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                    40</span>\n\n\nCircular No. 97-Emp. dated 6th June, 2005. Therefore Circular No. 97-\n\nEmp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp. concern the procedure governing\n\ncompassionate appointment, only qua State Government employees.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">      Further, applications for compassionate appointment are to be\n\nconsidered in light of the policy holding the field on the date on which\n\nthe application is filed. In the present case, the applications were filed\n\nin the year 2006. Therefore, they would have to be decided in light of\n\nCircular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp. Given that the\n\nsaid Circular does not govern compassionate appointment to posts\n\nunder local authorities, compassionate appointment cannot be granted\n\nto posts under local authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">\n16.3. It is the case of the Respondents-Writ Petitioners herein that\n\nthough Circular No. 97-Emp. read with Circular No. 142-Emp is not\n\napplicable to local authorities, their applications for compassionate\n\nappointment ought to have been considered in light of 301-Emp., 302-\n\nEmp. and 303-Emp. which, according to the Respondents-Writ\n\nPetitioners is applicable to all departments and authorities covered\n\nunder the Act of 1999. However, in our view, the said Circulars were\n\nnot understood or read to be a scheme governing all employees of other\n\nestablishments governed by the Act of 1999. We say so for the following\n\nreasons:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">i)   Circular No. 303-Emp. provides that any Department which has\n\n     vacancy in the Exempted Category of posts will provide employment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                                     41</span>\n\n\n      to the wife/son/daughter/near relation of the employee who died\n\n      in harness. Use of the word ‘Department’ would indicate that the\n\n      said Circular would govern compassionate appointment to\n\n      Departments of the State Government and not to local authorities.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">ii)   The meaning of the word ‘Department’ would have to be gathered,\n\n      having regard to the fact that the immediate notification\n\n      subsequent to 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303-Emp., being 97-Emp.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">      dated 6th June, 2005 notifies the departments in whose vacancies\n\n      the appointments would be granted. The Departments are of the\n\n      State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125900606\" id=\"span_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1125536\" id=\"span_64\">iii) If Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp. are to be read\n\n      so as to cover all establishments of the Act of 1999, then 97-Emp.\n\n      dated 6th June, 2005, should provide for appointment in the\n\n      establishment covered by the Act of 1999 concerned. It does not do\n\n      so. Therefore, Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp.\n\n      cannot be held to be applicable to local authorities.\n\n\n16.4. The existence of a policy issued by the State Government is a sine\n\nqua non for making appointments on compassionate basis, vide\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1125536/\" id=\"a_36\">Mumtaz Yunus Mulani (Smt.) vs. State of Maharashtra</a> (supra);\n\n<a href=\"/doc/125900606/\" id=\"a_37\">State Bank of India vs. Surya Narain Tripathi</a>, 2014 (15) SCC 739.\n\nThe appointments must follow the stipulations made in the policy. It is\n\ntherefore a no-brainer that in the absence of a policy governing\n\ncompassionate appointment to posts under a local authority, no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                    42</span>\n\n\nappointment could be made to such an authority on compassionate\n\ngrounds.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">    Having held that Circular Nos. 301-Emp, 302-Emp and 303-Emp.\n\ncannot be held to be applicable to local authorities, we are unable to\n\naffirm the findings of the Division Bench of the High Court to the effect\n\nthat given that Circular No. 301-Emp., 302-Emp. and 303 Emp. were\n\nnot specifically withdrawn, they would continue to remain applicable\n\nand therefore, compassionate appointment in respect of municipalities\n\nwould be governed by the scheme under Circular Nos. 301-Emp., 302-\n\nEmp. and 303-Emp.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">    We are further of the view that the liberty granted to the local\n\nauthorities in Circular No. 142-Emp. to formulate their own scheme for\n\ncompassionate appointment, is an acknowledgement of the fact that\n\nthere was no policy existing to govern compassionate appointment to\n\nposts under local authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n16.5. In fine, the present appeals succeed on two counts: first, there was\n\nno policy existing to govern compassionate appointment to posts under\n\nlocal authorities in the State of West Bengal and hence, in the absence\n\nof such a policy, compassionate appointment cannot be granted;\n\nsecond,    assuming that there was such a policy, it would be of no\n\nredeeming purpose to direct that the applications for appointment on\n\ncompassionate grounds be considered and decided several years after\n\nthey were filed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">\f                                    43</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">17.   In light of the aforesaid discussion, the instant appeals succeed\n\nin the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">i.

This\n\nfinding or observation, however, cannot aid the prosecution in a\n\nregular application for bail, the appeals in respect of which we\n\nare adjudicating.     The Court deciding on specific plea of the\n\nappellants for bail is required to independently apply its mind\n\n\n                                                          7 | Page\n\fand examine the materials placed before it for determining the\n\nquestion of granting bail to the individual applicants.",
