This doctrine of\n             equality before the law is a necessary corollary to the high\n             concept of the rule of law accepted by our Constitution. One\n             of the aspects of rule of law is that every executive action, if\n             it is to operate to the prejudice of any person, must be\n             supported by some legislative authority: see State of Madhya\n             Pradesh v.Thakur Bharat Singh [ Civil Appeal No. 1066 of\n             1965 (decided on 23-1-1967)] . Secondly, such a law would\n\n\n                                5 of 36\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">             ::: Downloaded on - 19-07-2023 02:03:42 :::</span>\n                                                   Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:088633\n\n\n\n\nCWP-27167 of 2018                   -6- 2023:PHHC:088633\nand all connected cases\n            be void, if it discriminates or enables an authority to\n            discriminate between persons without just classification.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">            What a legislature could not do, the executive could not\n            obviously do. But in the present case the executive claims a\n            right to issue a passport at its discretion; that is to say, it\n            can at its discretion prevent a person from leaving India on\n            foreign travel. Whether the right to travel is part of personal\n            liberty or not within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the\n            Constitution, such an arbitrary prevention of a person from\n            travelling abroad will certainly affect him prejudicially. A\n            person may like to go abroad for many reasons. He may like\n            to see the world, to study abroad, to undergo medical\n            treatment that is not available in our country, to collaborate\n            in scientific research, to develop his mental horizon in\n            different fields and such others. An executive arbitrariness\n            can prevent one from doing so and permit another to travel\n            merely for pleasure. While in the case of enacted law one\n            knows where he stands, in the case of unchannelled arbitrary\n            discretion, discrimination is writ large on the face of it. Such\n            a discretion patently violates the doctrine of equality, for the\n            difference in the treatment of persons rests solely on the\n            arbitrary selection of the executive. The argument that the\n            said discretionary power of the State is a political or a\n            diplomatic one does not make it anytheless an executive\n            power. We, therefore, hold that the order refusing to issue\n            the passport to the petitioner offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 14</a> of the\n            Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">9.

Usha Goel</a> (supra) the petitioner was seeking promotion on the post of Lecturer in Hindi and had completed five years continuous regular service on the first date of year of recruitment (01.01.2003). She, however, had passed M.A. in Hindi in 1999 and as such had not completed five years continuous regular service with the qualification for promoted post i.e. M.A. in Hindi and five years teaching experience in trained graduates grade on the first date of year of recruitment. Her claim for promotion came up before learned Single Judge in Civil Misc. Writ Petition No.6061 of 2004. An argument was raised on behalf of the petitioner that the words &#x27;as such&#x27; in rule 14 of Rules of 1998 refers to five years continuous regular service and not regular continuous service with the qualification prescribed for the post on which promotion was sought. Learned Single Judge examined the statutory scheme and held as under in para 8 to 10 of the judgement:-</span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       &quot;8. Before the commencement of U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Rules, 1983, Regulations 5 and 6 of <a href=\"/doc/169562622/\" id=\"a_15\">Chapter II of U.P. Intermediate Education Act, 1921</a> regulated the promotions. <a href=\"/doc/92503551/\" id=\"a_16\">Regulation 6</a> provides that all the L.T. or C.T. grade teachers, as the case may be, having a minimum of 5 years&#x27; continuous substantive service to their credit on the case of occurrence of vacancy shall be considered for promotion by the Committee of Management without their having to apply for the same provided they possess the prescribed minimum qualifications for teaching the subject in which the teacher in the lecturer&#x27;s grade or in the L.T. grade is required. Rule 9 of the Rules of 1983, qualified 5 years&#x27; continuous service as a teacher in the concerned subject on the date of occurrence of vacancy. After this amendment on 1.7.1983, Rule 9 provided consideration of all teachers working in L.T. grade or C.T. grade who possessed academic qualifications and have completed continuous teaching as teacher on the date of occurrence of vacancy to be considered for promotion to the Lecturer or L.T. grade as the case may be, without their having applied for the same. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"54635541\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/54635541/\" id=\"a_17\">Chandra Pratap Singh v. Madhav Saran Tripathi and others</a>, 1989 (1) UPLBEC 361, it was held that for promotion to the Lecturer or L.T. grade one has to possess minimum academic qualification and 5 years continuous service as a teacher on the date of occurrence of vacancy.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"153319669\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1917331\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/1917331/\" id=\"a_18\">Harish Chand v.

District Inspector of Schools</a>, (2000) 3 UPLBEC 2155, the word &#x27;Regular&#x27; in Rule 14, came up for interpretation.</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       9. The Rules of 1998 made in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/21436551/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 35</a> of U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Act, 1982, replaced the Rules of 1995, and came into force on 8th August, 1998. The words &#x27;as such&#x27; in Rule 14, after the words five years&#x27; continuous regular service, qualify both to the qualification prescribed for the post and five years&#x27; continuous regular service. The legislature has once again brought in the eligibility to only those persons who possessed qualification for the post and completed 5 years&#x27; regular service with such qualifications. The words qualifications prescribed for the post and five years&#x27; continuous regular service have been used in the same sentence, which is a compound (double) sentence, as a demonstrative pronoun, (Latin word demonstrare, to show clearly), and points to the person who possesses the qualification prescribed for the post.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">       10. The petitioner was awarded M.A. degree in Political Science and Economics in the year 1970-72. She was, however, awarded M. A. degree in Hindi in the year 1999 in IIIrd Division. There is no averment in the writ petition that as a L.T. grade teacher she was taking classes in Hindi as a subject. She is three years junior in age to respondent No. 6. She did not have five years&#x27; continuous service with qualifications in Hindi and thus she was not eligible for promotion to the vacant post of Lecturer in Hindi in the year of recruitment. &quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_14\">11. The view taken in <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_21\">Smt. Usha Goel</a> (supra) was followed in a subsequent decision of learned Single Judge in <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_22\">Shail Kumari</a> (supra).</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_16\">While following the view taken in <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_23\">Smt.

The submission of the learned Counsel for the respondents that five years of continuous regular service cannot be equated with the qualification prescribed for the post is patently erroneous. The words five years of continuous regular service would qualify both to the qualification prescribed for the post as well as for five years of continuous regular service. Consequently, this Court is in complete agreement with the judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_25\">Smt. Usha Goel</a> (supra).&quot;</span>\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1982489\" id=\"span_20\">12. Rule 14 of the Rules of 1998 again fell for consideration before this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1982489/\" id=\"a_26\">Ram Prakash Sharma</a> (supra) wherein learned Single Judge doubted the correctness of the view taken in <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_27\">Smt. Usha Goel</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_28\">Shail Kumari</a> (supra) and held as under in paragraph nos.12 to 22:-</span></span></span>\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       &quot;12. So far as the 1998 Rules are concerned, the only change brought about is that the teaching experience of 5 years required under the earlier rules has been further clarified to mean teaching experience as a regular teacher. Meaning thereby that the services rendered on ad hoc basis as teacher in the lower grade are not to be counted for the purpose of computing 5 years teaching experience.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       13. From reading of <a href=\"/doc/92503551/\" id=\"a_29\">Regulation 6</a> of Chapter II and Rule 9 of the 1983 regulating promotion it will be seen that there was no explicit demarcation qua the teaching experience of working as L.T. grade or C.T. grade for the purpose of promotion to lecturer grade and L.T. grade respectively.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       14. In my opinion the use of word &#x27;as such&#x27; under 1995 Rules and 1998 Rules relate to the particular post from which the teacher concerned is to be promoted i.e. C.T. Grade or L.T. Grade as well as to the post on which the promotion is to be made i.e. L.T. Grade or Lecturers Grade as the case may be. To put it simply it means that a teacher in C.T. grade must be possessed 5 years continuous regular teaching experience alongwith essential qualifications prescribed for the post of L.T. grade teacher for being considered for promoting as L.T. grade teacher and similarly an L.T. grade teacher possessed of 5 years regular teaching experience as L.T. grade teacher and essential qualification prescribed for the post of Lecturer concerned is to be considered for promotion on the post of Lecturer.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_22\">15. It is not necessary that such teaching experience of 5 years must be from the date the candidate had acquired the minimum academic qualification qua the promotional post as has been held in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_30\">Usha Goyal</a> (supra) and as followed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_31\">Shail Kumari</a> (Supra).</span></span>\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       16. On reading of the rules, as were existing earlier, it would be seen that it left, some reason to doubt qua the teaching experience to be possessed by the candidate concerned. It could be argued in a given case that a teacher, who was initially appointed as a teacher in C.T. Grade and subsequently appointed by direct recruitment as L.T. Grade could assert that for computing the 5 years of teaching experience under the Rules, the length of service rendered in CT grade be also counted, for promotion to Lecturer grade.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       17. For example, a teacher appointed in C.T. Grade in one particular institution and having worked as such for two years, on his subsequent appointment as a L.T. Grade teacher by direct recruitment in another recognized Intermediate College, on completing 3 years of service as L.T. grade teacher could claim that he had 5 years of teaching experience as contemplated under the Rules (prior to Rules of 1995) for promotion in Lecturers Grade.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       19. It is for the purpose of removing this ambiguity that amendments under the 1995 Rules have been made requiring the teacher concerned to be possessed of 5 years teaching experience of the post from which he is to be promoted and the qualification of the post on which he is to be promoted. The word &#x27;as such&#x27; only suggest that this 5 years teaching experience is to be possessed in the lower grade with reference to the post on which promotion is to be made.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       20. Another reason for the said conclusion is that earlier there was a requirement of 5 years teaching experience in the subject concerned, with reference to the promotional post. This requirement was deleted by the Legislature consciously under Rules 1983 as amended in 1986-87. No purpose is to be achieved by insisting upon the requirement of the teacher concerned to have worked for 5 year after achieving the qualifications qua the post on which he is to be promoted, when he is to continue to teach in the lower grade in a different subject.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">       21. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319584\" id=\"span_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896882\" id=\"span_24\">In these circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that the law as <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_32\">laid down in</a> the case of <a href=\"/doc/1896882/\" id=\"a_33\">Usha Goel</a> (supra) as followed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_34\">Shail Kumari</a> (supra) requires to be examined by a Larger Bench of this Court.

In order to appreciate the true intent of expression &#x27;as such&#x27; occurring in Rule 14 of the Rules of 1998 it would be necessary to refer to the scheme for promotion of teachers under the Act of 1982 in Secondary Education Institution recognized under the Act of 1921. <a href=\"/doc/169562622/\" id=\"a_38\">The Act</a> of 1982 was passed by the U.P.

Rule 10 stipulates sources of recruitment to the post of teachers in different categories. Sub-rule (a) of Rule 10 specifies the post of Principal of an Intermediate College or Headmaster of a High School. This post is to be filled by direct recruitment. Then comes the post of teachers in Lecturers Grade. Recruitment on the post of Lecturers Grade is 50% by direct recruitment and 50% by promotion from amongst substantively appointed teachers of the Trained Graduates Grade. Sub-rule (c) refers to appointment of teachers of Trained Graduates Category by direct recruitment. 75% of posts of teachers of Trained Graduates Category are to be filled by direct recruitment and the rest 25% posts are to be filled through promotion of those trained graduate teachers of attached primary section who have completed satisfactory services of five years. The proviso contemplates that where there is no eligible candidate available for recruitment through promotion in any recruitment year the post may be filled through direct recruitment. Sub-rule (d) provides that teachers of attached primary section are to be entirely appointed by direct recruitment.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">    15. Rule 11 contemplates determination and notification of vacancies. The posts in trained graduates grade are to be advertised group-wise in accordance with eight groups specified therein. First group is of Language, which consists of the subjects Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian and Arabic; (b) Science Group consists of the subjects of Science and Mathematics. There are then separate groups of (c) Arts and Craft; (d) Music; (e) Agriculture; (f) Home Science; (g) Physical Education; and (h) General, which consists of the subjects not covered in any of the foregoing groups.   \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">    16. The scheme for determination and notification of vacancies as per Rule 11 as well as sources of recruitment<a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_44\">, <a href=\"/doc/1319584/\" id=\"a_45\">referred to above</a></a>, as per the Rules of 1998 are similar to Rule 10 and 11 of the Rules of 1995. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">    17. It was only for the brief period between 10.1.1983 to 1.7.1983 that procedure for appointment by promotion to the post of Lecturer or L.T. Grade required possessing of minimum qualification and five years continuous service as teacher in the concerned subject on the date of occurrence of vacancy. This requirement of five years continuous service as a teacher in the concerned subject was specifically excluded after 1.7.1983.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">    18. The expression &#x27;as such&#x27; for the first time surfaced in Rule 14 of the Rules of 1995 specifying requirement of qualification prescribed for the post and the requirement of having five years continuous service on the first date of the year of recruitment in the feeding cadre.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">    19. In order to understand the view point of State on the import of Rule 14 of the Rules of 1995 we called upon the State Counsel to clarify the stand of State Government in the matter. The Special Secretary to the State has filed an affidavit on 01.03.2023 clarifying the stand of State Government in following words:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">       &quot;That it is pertinent to state here that the State Government, under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/21210184/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 14(1)</a> of the U.P. Secondary Education Service Selection Board Rules, 1998 for the purposes of promotion on the post of the Lecturers considers those Assistant Teachers (L.T. Grade), if any, who have completed five years continuous regular service and possesses the qualifications prescribed for the post on the first day of the year of recruitment. It is relevant to state here that according to this very procedure and as per the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Special Subordinate Educational (Lecturer&#x27;s Cadre) Service (First Amendment) Rules, 2016, the proceedings for promotion on the post of Lecturers in Government Inter Colleges are also adopted by the Commission.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">    20. Sri Neeraj Tripathi, learned Additional Advocate General, submits that the twin requirement for promotion under rule 14(1) of the Rules of 1998 is five years continuous regular service as also the qualification prescribed for the post on the first day of the year of recruitment. He contends that there is no requirement of five years continuous regular service with qualification for the promoted post under Rule 14.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">    21. Sri R. K. Ojha, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners takes up stand similar to that of the State as per which there is no requirement for the candidate to possess five years continuous regular service with the qualification for promotion under rule 14. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">    22. Sri Anil Tiwari, per contra, contends that the expression &#x27;as such&#x27; occurring in rule 14 qualifies both the ingredients i.e. qualification and five years continuous regular service for promotion.
