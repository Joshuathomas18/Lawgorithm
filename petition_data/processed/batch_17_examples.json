Learned counsel for the applicant and other members of the Bar have contended that:  \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(i).

The accused can challenge the age of a victim in bail proceedings. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(iii). Attention is called to the liberal interpretation of the enquiry under <a href=\"/doc/187659331/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 94</a> of the JJ Act, 2015 by authorities in point. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(iv). The presumptions under <a href=\"/doc/187659331/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 94</a> of the JJ Act, 2015 and <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 29</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 can not prejudice the rights of an accused at the stage of bail.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(v). A large number of cases under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_17\">POCSO Act</a> relate to runaway couples, and arise from family opposition to such relationships. In bail application excluding evidence or limiting the challenge to the age of the victim which is often on the borderline of majority and at times false, would result in miscarriage of justice for the accused.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">Submissions on behalf of the State by learned AGA:        \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(i). <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_18\">POCSO Act</a> is a special Act where the legislature has made stringent provisions to protect the interests of victims who are minors. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(ii). <a href=\"/doc/187659331/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 94</a> of the JJ Act, 2015 shall be strictly interpreted and applied at the bail stage to implement the intent of the legislature. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(iii). The presumption of <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 29</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 is triggered at the lodgement of the F.I.R. otherwise its purpose will be defeated. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(iv).

If not what is the manner of assessing the age of a victim in a bail application under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_22\">POCSO Act</a> when a challenge is laid to it by an accused? \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">II. Whether the presumption of culpable intent under <a href=\"/doc/152203365/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 29</a> of the POCSO Act, 2012 is attracted against the accused at the stage of bail?\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">IV.
