The said Act received Presidential assent on\n\n25 November, 1955.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">3.2. The appellant, NHPC Ltd. is engaged in the generation of\n\nelectricity and has various projects in the State of Himachal Pradesh.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">Many project sites are situated at different locations in the interiors of\n\nHimachal Pradesh. These work sites are not properly serviced by any\n\npublic transport system or regular taxis. The residential colonies of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                     4</span>\n\n\nstaff employed at the various project sites are located at far of distances\n\nfrom the project sites. Therefore, as a welfare measure, the appellant,\n\nNHPC Ltd. provides transport facilities to its employees in order to\n\nenable them to reach their respective work sites from their residential\n\ncolonies and for their children to travel to and from their schools,\n\ncomfortably. It is to be clarified at this juncture that the transport\n\nfacilities were being provided free of cost, for the exclusive use of the\n\nemployees of the appellant and their children and members of the public\n\nwere not permitted to use the said transport facilities. The buses utilized\n\nfor such purpose were owned and operated by the appellant-NHPC Ltd.\n\n\n3.3. The Assessing Authority under the Act of 1955, Respondent No. 3\n\nherein, assessed the liability of the appellant-NHPC Ltd. to pay\n\npassenger tax under the Act for the years 1984-1985 to 1986-1987 and\n\n1987-1988 to 1990-1991 in respect of the activity of providing transport\n\nfacilities to its employees and their children. Assessment Orders were\n\npassed on 01 October, 1992 stipulating the liability of the appellant,\n\nNHPC Ltd. to pay passenger tax under the Act of 1955, on the premise\n\nthat its employees and their children were passengers under the Act\n\nand therefore, the appellant was liable to pay passenger tax for\n\nproviding them with transport facilities as described hereinabove. It is\n\nto be stated at this juncture that the Assessment Orders were passed\n\non the assumption that every bus of the appellant, NHPC Ltd. was\n\nplying on every day of the relevant years; a passenger travelled on every\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                            5</span>\n\n\n      seat of every bus; and every employee travelled the full distance shown\n\n      in the logbook.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\n      3.4.    The appellant filed Revision Application before the Commissioner,\n\n      Excise and Taxation, Himachal Pradesh, Respondent No. 2 herein,\n\n      challenging the Assessment Orders dated 01 October, 1992. The same\n\n      was dismissed on the ground that a revision application would not be\n\n      maintainable and it would be appropriate to instead, file an appeal.\n\n\n      3.5. In the said background, the appellant, NHPC Ltd. filed Writ\n\n      Petition No.1733 of 1995 before the High Court, challenging the vires of\n\n      the Act of 1955, and the assessments made in accordance with the\n\n      provisions thereof. The pertinent contentions raised by the appellant in\n\n      the said Writ Petition may be encapsulated as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"> i.          That under the Act of 1955, no tax can be levied on the appellant\n\n             as its employees and their children were being carried in the\n\n             appellant’s buses, without any fare or consideration. That\n\n             passenger tax as contemplated under the Act of 1955 was to be\n\n             levied only on fare-paying passengers against tickets issued by the\n\n             owner of the motor vehicles, who is engaged in the business of\n\n             carrying passengers for hire and reward.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">ii.          That no rate or fare had been specified by the competent authority\n\n             under the <a href=\"/doc/24626380/\" id=\"a_5\">Motor Vehicles Act, 1939</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_6\">MV\n\n             Act</a>” for short) for the routes on which the appellant’s buses plied,\n\n             nor had any contractual rate been agreed upon between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                           6</span>\n\n\n           appellants and its employees. Therefore, the charging provision,\n\n           i.e., <a href=\"/doc/189565512/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 3 (1)</a> of the Act of 1955 and the Explanation thereto\n\n           would not be attracted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">iii.       That in passing the Assessment Orders dated 01 October, 1992,\n\n           erroneous and baseless assumptions had been made to the effect\n\n           that every bus of the appellant, NHPC Ltd. was plying on every day\n\n           of the relevant year; a passenger travelled on every seat of every\n\n           bus; every employee travelled the full distance shown in the\n\n           logbook; and every passenger was paying a fare of Rs. 1.15 per\n\n           kilometer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">iv.        That even if the assessee was liable to pay tax under the Act of\n\n           1955, they would not be liable to pay surcharge under <a href=\"/doc/42391191/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3A</a>\n\n           of the Act as the said provision would not be applicable to the\n\n           appellants. Further, <a href=\"/doc/42391191/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 3A</a> of the Act of            1955 was\n\n           unconstitutional and suffered from excessive delegation of powers\n\n           to the State Government to prescribe the rate of surcharge leviable,\n\n           without laying down any guideline on the basis of which surcharge\n\n           was to be prescribed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n       3.6. By the Judgment and Order dated 27 March, 1997, the Division\n\n       Bench of the High Court allowed Civil Writ Petition No.1733 of 1995\n\n       filed by the appellant and directed the Respondents to refund the tax\n\n       collected under the provisions of the Act of 1955. The pertinent findings\n\n       of the Division Bench of the High Court are culled out hereinunder:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                       7</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"> i.    That the scheme of the Act of 1955 was to levy a tax on passengers\n\n       of certain motor vehicles only. Intention of the legislature could be\n\n       gathered from the various definitions contained in <a href=\"/doc/143111250/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 2</a> of the\n\n       Act, and the same was to make the Act applicable only to persons\n\n       who carried on the business of transport. The definition of ‘owner’\n\n       would fortify such finding, as ‘owner’ was defined to mean a person\n\n       holding a permit under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_11\">Motor Vehicles Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">ii.    That the liability of the assessee was to be determined for the years\n\n       1984-1985 to 1986-1987 and 1987-1988 to 1990-1991.",
