    "facts": "The petitioner, Mrs. Ananya Mehta, widow of Mr. Raghav Mehta, filed a criminal petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court on June 18, 2025, alleging that her husband’s death on April 10, 2025, was not an accident but a pre-meditated murder driven by business rivalry. The primary respondent is Mr. Devansh Kapoor, former business partner of the deceased, with whom serious financial and legal disputes had arisen in the months preceding the incident. The case involves significant evidence, including a First Information Report (FIR No. 178/2025) filed at the South Delhi Police Station, a forensic report confirming traces of poison in the victim’s bloodstream, and communication records—including threatening emails and financial disagreements—between Mr. Mehta and Mr. Kapoor.Two key witnesses include Mr. Rajiv Sinha, an employee who overheard heated arguments between the two businessmen, and Mrs. Priya Desai, a neighbor who reported suspicious activity outside the Mehta residence the night of the death. The petitioner has submitted bank statements and business contracts showing abrupt fund transfers and ownership disputes. No prior legal action had been pursued before this petition. Mrs. Mehta now seeks a full criminal trial and the framing of charges under Section 302 of the IPC and related provisions for conspiracy. She has also requested urgent judicial intervention, citing concerns over evidence tampering and pressure being exerted on witnesses.",

The petitioner alleges that the death of her husband, Mr. Raghav Mehta, on April 10, 2025, was not an accidental event, but rather a deliberate act of premeditated murder motivated by intense business rivalry and a history of significant conflict between the two parties.\\n\\n**Facts of the Case**\\n\\nOn April 10, 2025, Mr. Raghav Mehta tragically succumbed to his injuries, resulting in his death. The circumstances surrounding his death are deeply concerning, given the escalating tensions and disputes that existed between Mr. Mehta and Mr. Devansh Kapoor, his former business partner. Prior to his demise, the petitioner discovered a history of significant financial discrepancies and legal disagreements between the two men. The petitioner has gathered substantial evidence indicating a clear motive and intent to harm. The First Information Report (FIR No. 178/2025) filed at the South Delhi Police Station further corroborates these concerns, initiating a criminal investigation into the matter.  \\n\\nThe evidence collected reveals the following key elements:\\n\\n*   **Threatening Communication:** The petitioner has presented communication records, including threatening emails exchanged between Mr. Mehta and Mr. Kapoor, demonstrating a clear pattern of intimidation and hostility.\\n*   **Financial Disputes:** Bank statements and business contracts highlight significant financial disagreements and abrupt fund transfers, suggesting an attempt to destabilize Mr. Mehta’s business interests.\\n*   **Witness Testimony:**  Two crucial witnesses, Mr. Rajiv Sinha, an employee who overheard heated arguments between the two businessmen, and Mrs. Priya Desai, a neighbor who reported suspicious activity outside the Mehta residence the night of the death, have corroborated the petitioner's claims.\\n*   **Forensic Evidence:**  The forensic report confirming traces of poison in the victim’s bloodstream provides irrefutable evidence of foul play.\\n\\n\\n**Relief Sought**\\n\\nThe petitioner respectfully requests the Hon’ble Supreme Court to:\\n\\n1.  Direct the concerned authorities to expedite the ongoing criminal investigation into the death of Mr. Raghav Mehta.\\n2.  Issue directions for the filing of charges under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and any other relevant provisions of law, including charges of conspiracy and criminal intimidation.\\n3.  Order a full criminal trial with due regard to the evidence presented by the petitioner and the prosecution.\\n4.  Take immediate cognizance of the evidence and circumstances to protect the integrity of the investigation and prevent any potential evidence tampering or undue influence on witnesses.\\n\\n**Legal Grounds**\\n\\nThe petitioner’s claims are founded on the following legal principles:\\n\\n*   **Presumption of Criminal Intent:**  The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kapoor intentionally caused the death of Mr. Mehta.\\n*   **Criminal Conspiracy:** The petitioner contends that Mr. Kapoor engaged in criminal conspiracy to harm Mr. Mehta.\\n*   **Right to Fair Trial:** The petitioner asserts her fundamental right to a fair trial and the opportunity to present her case before a court of law.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn light of the compelling evidence and the serious allegations presented, the petitioner implores the Hon’ble Supreme Court to intervene and ensure that justice is served. The petitioner’s request for a full criminal trial is not merely a matter of legal procedure; it is a fundamental necessity to uphold the sanctity of life and to hold those responsible for Mr. Mehta’s tragic death accountable for their actions.  \\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\n(Advocate for the Petitioner)\\n\\n[Advocate’s Name and Contact Information]\"\n}\n```\n"
